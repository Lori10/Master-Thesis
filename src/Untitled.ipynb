      "Nancy Pelosi is a staunch supporter of abortion rights (Titlec). She has voted against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 and earlier attempts at similar bans, and voted against the criminalization of certain situations where a minor is transported across state lines for an abortion (Title). Pelosi has voted in favor of lifting the ban on privately funded abortions at overseas U.S. military facilities, in favor of an amendment that would repeal a provision forbidding servicewomen and dependents from getting an abortion in overseas military hospitals, and in favor of stripping the prohibition of funding for organizations working overseas that use their own funds to provide abortion services, or engage in advocacy related to abortion services (Title). She supports legal abortion and has brought the Women's Health Protection Act, which would override state abortion laws and allow for abortions in some cases throughout all nine months of pregnancy, up for a vote in the House (Title2490). Pelosi has defended congressional funding for Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider, and vowed to defend the landmark abortion legalization case Roe v. Wade with \"every tool in our disposal\" (Titlec). She has been honored by EMILY's List, an abortion rights political action committee, for her support of progressive legislation during her tenure as the first female Speaker of the House (Title4007). Pelosi defended President Joe Biden's response to the recent Supreme Court decision that struck down the constitutionality of Roe v. Wade, stating that she has no question about this administration's support for a woman's right to choose (Titleb).\n",

      "Harbor seals tend to be coastal and do not venture more than 20 km offshore. They may spend several days at sea and travel up to 50 km in search of feeding grounds. Resting sites may be both rugged, rocky coasts or sandy beaches. They frequently congregate in harbors, bays, sandy intertidal zones, and estuaries in pursuit of prey fish. They occasionally swim more than a hundred miles upstream into fresh water in large rivers in search of migratory fish like shad and likely salmon (Titlec). However, the provided context from the National Zoological Park__United_States__26 does not provide any additional information on where harbor seals usually live.\n",

The mating\\nsystem is not known, but thought to be [polygamous](/wiki/Polygamous\\n\"Polygamous\"). Females give birth once per year, with a\\n[gestation](/wiki/Gestation \"Gestation\") period around nine months. Females\\nhave a mean age at sexual maturity of 3.72 years and a mean age at first\\nparturition of 4.64.[11] Both [courtship](/wiki/Courtship \"Courtship\") and\\n[mating](/wiki/Mating \"Mating\") occur under water.[12][11] Researchers have\\nfound males gather under water, turn on their backs, put their heads together,\\nand vocalize to attract females ready for breeding.[13] Pregnancy rate of\\nfemales was 92% from age 3 to age 36, with lowered reproductive success after\\nthe age of 25 years.[11]\\n\\nBirthing of pups occurs annually on shore. The timing of the pupping season\\nvaries with location,[14] occurring in February for populations in lower\\nlatitudes, and as late as July in the subarctic zone. The mothers are the sole\\nproviders of care, with lactation lasting 24 days.[15] The single pups are\\nborn well developed, capable of swimming and diving within hours. Suckling for\\nthree to four weeks, pups feed on the mother\\'s rich, fatty milk and grow\\nrapidly; born weighing up to 16 kilograms, the pups may double their weight by\\nthe time of [weaning](/wiki/Weaning \"Weaning\").\\n\\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Young_common_seal_on_beach_at_Cley_Eye_-\\n_geograph.org.uk_-_927102.jpg/220px-Young_common_seal_on_beach_at_Cley_Eye_-\\n_geograph.org.uk_-_927102.jpg)](/wiki/File:Young_common_seal_on_beach_at_Cley_Eye_-\\n_geograph.org.uk_-_927102.jpg)\\n\\n[](/wiki/File:Young_common_seal_on_beach_at_Cley_Eye_-\\n_geograph.org.uk_-_927102.jpg \"Enlarge\")\\n\\nA pup\\n\\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Harbor_seal_is_nurcing_at_Point_Lobos.jpg/220px-\\nHarbor_seal_is_nurcing_at_Point_Lobos.jpg)](/wiki/File:Harbor_seal_is_nurcing_at_Point_Lobos.jpg)\\n\\n[](/wiki/File:Harbor_seal_is_nurcing_at_Point_Lobos.jpg \"Enlarge\")\\n\\nPup nursing at [Point Lobos](/wiki/Point_Lobos \"Point Lobos\") in California.\\n\\nHarbor seals must spend a great deal of time on shore when\\n[molting](/wiki/Moulting \"Moulting\"), which occurs shortly after breeding.\\nThis onshore time is important to the life cycle, and can be disturbed when\\nsubstantial human presence occurs.[16] The timing of onset of molt depends on\\nthe age and sex of the animal, with yearlings molting first and adult males\\nlast.[17] A female mates again immediately following the weaning of her pup.\\nHarbor seals are sometimes reluctant to haul out in the presence of humans, so\\nshoreline development and access must be carefully studied in known locations\\nof seal haul out.[ _[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\\n\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_ ]\\n\\nIn comparison to many pinniped species, and in contrast to otariid pinnipeds,\\nharbor seals are generally regarded to be more vocally reticent. However, they\\ndo utilize non-harmonic vocalizations to maintain breeding territories and to\\nattract mates during specified times of year,[18] and also during mother and\\npup interactions.[19]\\n\\nAnnual survival rates were calculated at 0.91 for adult males,[11] and 0.902\\nfor adult females.[20] Maximum age for females was 36 and for males 31\\nyears.[11]\\n\\n### In North\\nAmerica[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Harbor_seal&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit\\nsection: In North America\")]\\n\\n#### Pacific Coast[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Harbor_seal&action=edit&section=7\\n\"Edit section: Pacific Coast\")]\\n\\nThe California population of subspecies _P. v. richardsi_ amounted to about\\n25,000 individuals as of 1984.
