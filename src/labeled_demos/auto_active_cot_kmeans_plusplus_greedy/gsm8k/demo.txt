Q: Ken created a care package to send to his brother, who was away at boarding school.  Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.  Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple.  Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans.  And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again.  What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds?
A:
 Let's think step by step.
To the initial 2 pounds of jelly beans, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple, bringing the weight to 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 pounds.
Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans, bringing the weight to 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 pounds.
And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again, to a final weight of 8*2=<<8*2=16>>16 pounds. The answer is 16.



Q: Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?
A:
 Let's think step by step.
Let S be the amount Alexis paid for the shoes.
She spent S + 30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 = S + <<+30+46+38+11+18=143>>143.
She used all but $16 of her budget, so S + 143 = 200 - 16 = 184.
Thus, Alexis paid S = 184 - 143 = $<<184-143=41>>41 for the shoes. The answer is 41.
