  "test_question": "Q: Ram and Krishna start from A and B, respectively, at the same time and travel towards each other at constant speeds of 20m/s and 40m/s, respectively, along the same route. Ram meets Krishna at point C on the road after 10 seconds. Find the total distance between A to B. Answer Choices: (A) 700 meters (B) 1000 meters (C) 700 kilometers (D) 555 meters (E) 600 meters",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: What would happen in the previous question if both A and B had started at point P. Answer Choices: (A) 800 Km (B) 600 Km (C) 1000 Km (D) 350 Km (E) 250 Km\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that A travels at a speed of 50 km/h and B travels at a speed of 40 km/h. If they both started at point P, they would be moving in opposite directions. Let's say they meet after x hours. In that time, A would have traveled 50x km and B would have traveled 40x km. We also know that the distance between A and B is 600 km. So, we can set up the equation: 50x + 40x = 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 90x = 600 x = 6.67 hours Now that we know they meet after 6.67 hours, we can find out how far each of them has traveled: A: 50 km/h x 6.67 h = 333.33 km B: 40 km/h x 6.67 h = 266.67 km The total distance they have traveled is: 333.33 km + 266.67 km = 600 km Therefore, the answer is (B) 600 km. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Two trains 110 m and 160 m long run at the speed of 60 km/hr and 40 km/hr respectively in opposite directions on parallel tracks. The time which they take to cross each other is? Answer Choices: (A) 10.9 (B) 10.7 (C) 10.3 (D) 10.8 (E) 9.72\nA: Let's think step by step. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds, which is 60 + 40 = 100 km/hr. We need to convert this to meters per second (m/s) to match the units of the lengths of the trains. We know that 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s, so: 100 km/hr = (100 x 5/18) m/s = 250/9 m/s Now we can use the formula: time = distance / speed The distance that the two trains need to cover to cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is 110 + 160 = 270 m. Plugging in the values, we get: time = 270 / (250/9) = 10.8 seconds Therefore, the answer is (D) 10.8. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Two trains each 250 m in length are running on the same parallel lines in opposite directions with the speed of 80 kmph and 70 kmph respectively. In what time will they cross each other completely? Answer Choices: (A) 19 sec (B) 22 sec (C) 12 sec (D) 42 sec (E) 32 sec\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speeds from kmph to m/s. Speed of first train = 80 kmph = (80 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 22.22 m/s Speed of second train = 70 kmph = (70 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 19.44 m/s Now, we need to find the relative speed of the two trains. Relative speed = (Speed of first train + Speed of second train) = (22.22 + 19.44) m/s = 41.66 m/s The total distance to be covered by the two trains to cross each other completely is the sum of their lengths, which is 250 + 250 = 500 m. Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed Time = 500 / 41.66 Time = 12 sec Therefore, the answer is (C) 12 sec. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Two trains are running at 40 km/h and 20 km/h respectively in the same direction. Fast train completely passes a man sitting in the slower train in 5 seconds. What is the length of the fast train? Answer Choices: (A) 23 m (B) 23 2\u20449 m (C) 27 m (D) 27 7\u20449 m (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the relative speed of the two trains. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract their speeds: Relative speed = 40 km/h - 20 km/h = 20 km/h We need to convert this to meters per second (m/s) to use it in the formula for distance: 20 km/h = (20 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 5.56 m/s Now we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time We know the time (5 seconds) and the speed (5.56 m/s), so we just need to find the distance. Distance = 5.56 m/s x 5 s = 27.8 m But this is the distance traveled by both the train and the man sitting in it. We only want the length of the fast train, so we need to subtract the length of the man (assumed to be negligible) from the total distance: Length of fast train = 27.8 m - 0 m = 27.8 m None of the answer choices match this result exactly, but (D) 27 7\u20449 m is the closest. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
