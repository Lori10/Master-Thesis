  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Quentin's income is 60% less than Rex's income, and Ram's income is 25% less than Quentin's income. If Rex gave 60% of his income to Ram and 40% of his income to Quentin, Quentin's new income would be what fraction of Ram's new income? Answer Choices: (A) 8/9 (B) 11/12 (C) 8/13 (D) 11/13 (E) 12/13\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume Rex's income to be 100. Then Quentin's income would be 40 (60% less than Rex's income). And Ram's income would be 30 (25% less than Quentin's income). Now, if Rex gave 60% of his income to Ram, Ram's new income would be 60 (60% of 100). And if Rex gave 40% of his income to Quentin, Quentin's new income would be 40 (40% of 100). Therefore, Quentin's new income is 4/3 times his old income (40/30), and Ram's new income is 2 times his old income (60/30). So, Quentin's new income is (4/3)/(2) = 8/13 times Ram's new income. Therefore, the answer is (C) 8/13. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A and B invest in a business in the ratio 3 : 2. If 5% of the total profit goes to charity and A's share is Rs. 855, the total profit is: Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 1425 (B) Rs. 1500 (C) Rs. 1537.50 (D) Rs. 1576 (E) Rs. 1600\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the total profit be x. Since A and B invest in the ratio 3:2, their share of profit will also be in the ratio 3:2. Let A's share be 3y, and B's share be 2y. Now, we know that 5% of the total profit goes to charity. So, the remaining 95% will be divided between A and B in the ratio 3:2. Therefore, A's share will be (3/5) * 95% * x = 57% of x. We are given that A's share is Rs. 855. So, 57% of x = 855. Solving for x, we get x = Rs. 1500. Therefore, the total profit is Rs. 1500. Hence, the correct answer is option (B) Rs. 1500. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A and B invests Rs.2500 and Rs.4000 respectively in a business. If A doubles his capital after 6 months. In what ratio should A and B divide that year's profit? Answer Choices: (A) 11:5 (B) 15:16 (C) 15:2 (D) 9:9 (E) 11:1\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total investment made by A and B. Total investment = Rs.2500 + Rs.4000 = Rs.6500 After 6 months, A doubles his capital. So, his new investment becomes Rs.5000. Now, the ratio of their investments is: A:B = Rs.5000 : Rs.4000 = 5:4 Let's assume that the total profit for the year is Rs.X. A's share of profit = (5/9) X B's share of profit = (4/9) X Therefore, the ratio in which they should divide the profit is: A:B = (5/9) X : (4/9) X = 5:4 So, the correct answer is (D) 9:9. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Three friends had dinner at a restaurant. When the bill was received, Akshitha paid 1/4 as much as Veena paid and Veena paid 1/2 as much as Lasya paid. What fraction of the bill did Veena pay ? Answer Choices: (A) 3/19 (B) 3/12 (C) 3/11 (D) 3/10 (E) 4/13\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that Lasya paid x amount for the dinner. According to the problem, Veena paid 1/2 as much as Lasya paid. So, Veena paid (1/2)x amount for the dinner. And, Akshitha paid 1/4 as much as Veena paid. So, Akshitha paid (1/4)(1/2)x = (1/8)x amount for the dinner. Now, the total bill is the sum of what all three friends paid. So, x + (1/2)x + (1/8)x = (13/8)x Therefore, Veena paid (1/2)x = (4/13)(13/8)x = (1/2) * (13/8)x = (13/16)x amount for the dinner. So, the answer is (E) 4/13. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
