  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If on an item a company gives 25% discount, they earn 25% profit.If they now give 10% discount then what is the profit? Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 40 (C) 50 (D) 60 (E) 70\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the original price of the item is $100. With a 25% discount, the selling price becomes 75% of the original price, which is $75. Now, we know that the company earns a 25% profit on this selling price of $75. Profit = 25% of $75 = $18.75 So, the cost price of the item for the company is $75 - $18.75 = $56.25 If the company now gives a 10% discount, the selling price becomes 90% of $75, which is $67.50. The cost price for the company remains the same at $56.25. Profit = Selling price - Cost price = $67.50 - $56.25 = $11.25 Therefore, the profit is $11.25. The correct answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the calculated profit. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Eleven bags are bought for Rs.1000 and sold at 10 for Rs.1500. What is the gain or loss in percentage? Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 21% (C) 26% (D) 20% (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve the problem step by step. Let the cost price of one bag be x. So, the cost price of 11 bags will be 11x. The bags are sold at 10 for Rs.1500. So, the selling price of 10 bags will be Rs.1500. Therefore, the selling price of 1 bag will be Rs.150. So, the selling price of 11 bags will be 11 x Rs.150 = Rs.1650. Now, we can calculate the profit or loss percentage using the formula: Profit or loss percentage = (Profit or loss / Cost price) x 100 Profit or loss = Selling price - Cost price Cost price of 11 bags = Rs.1000 Selling price of 11 bags = Rs.1650 Profit or loss = Rs.1650 - Rs.1000 = Rs.650 Profit or loss percentage = (650/1000) x 100 = 65% Therefore, the answer is None of the above, as none of the given options match the calculated profit or loss percentage of 65%. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The C.P of 15 books is equal to the S.P of 18 books. Find his gain% or loss%? Answer Choices: (A) 16 2/3% (B) 16 2/8% (C) 16 7/3% (D) 16 5/3% (E) 16 6/3%\nA: Let's think step by step. Given, C.P of 15 books = S.P of 18 books Let the cost price of 1 book be x. Then, the cost price of 15 books = 15x And, the selling price of 18 books = 18x Now, we need to find the gain or loss percentage. Gain or Loss percentage = [(Selling price - Cost price) / Cost price] x 100 Since the selling price is greater than the cost price, there is a gain. Gain percentage = [(18x - 15x) / 15x] x 100 = (3x / 15x) x 100 = 20% Therefore, the answer is not in the given options. The correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The cash difference between the selling prices of an article at a profit of 2% and 4% is Rs 3. The ratio of two selling prices is Answer Choices: (A) 51:52 (B) 52:53 (C) 53:54 (D) 54:55 (E) 51:52\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the cost price of the article be x. Selling price at a profit of 2% = 1.02x Selling price at a profit of 4% = 1.04x Given, the cash difference between the selling prices = Rs 3 So, 1.04x - 1.02x = 3 0.02x = 3 x = 150 Therefore, the selling price at a profit of 2% = 1.02 x 150 = Rs 153 The selling price at a profit of 4% = 1.04 x 150 = Rs 156 The ratio of the two selling prices = 153:156 Simplifying the ratio, we get 51:52 Hence, the answer is (A) 51:52. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
