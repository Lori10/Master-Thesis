  "formatted_prompt": "Q: How many ways can 3 friends be arranged around a circular dinner table? Answer Choices: (A) A) 16 (B) B) 2 (C) C) 96 (D) D) 120 (E) E) 720\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We have 3 friends who need to be arranged around a circular dinner table. Step 1: Choose one friend to sit at the \"top\" of the table. This can be done in 3 ways. Step 2: Arrange the remaining 2 friends in the remaining 2 seats. This can be done in 2 ways. Step 3: Since the table is circular, we need to divide by the number of rotations. In other words, we need to divide by 3 because there are 3 ways to rotate the table and get the same arrangement. So the total number of arrangements is (3 x 2) / 3 = 2. Therefore, the answer is (B) 2. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Six students are equally divided into 3 groups, then, the three groups were assigned to three different topics. How many different arrangements Q are possible? Answer Choices: (A)  30 (B)  60 (C)  90 (D)  180 (E)  540\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We need to find the number of ways to divide 6 students equally into 3 groups. This can be done using combinations. We need to choose 2 students from 6 for the first group, then 2 students from the remaining 4 for the second group, and the remaining 2 students will be in the third group. The number of ways to choose 2 students from 6 is 6C2 = 15. The number of ways to choose 2 students from 4 is 4C2 = 6. So the total number of ways to divide 6 students equally into 3 groups is 15 x 6 = 90. Step 2: We need to find the number of ways to assign the 3 groups to 3 different topics. This can be done in 3! = 6 ways. Step 3: We need to find the total number of arrangements Q by multiplying the results of step 1 and step 2. Q = 90 x 6 = 540. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 540. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In how many ways can a group of 3 men and 3 women be made out of a total of 7 men and 4 women? Answer Choices: (A) 163 (B) 167 (C) 130 (D) 174 (E) 180\nA: Let's think step by step. We need to select 3 men out of 7 men and 3 women out of 4 women. The number of ways to select 3 men out of 7 men is 7C3 = (7*6*5)/(3*2*1) = 35. The number of ways to select 3 women out of 4 women is 4C3 = (4*3*2)/(3*2*1) = 4. The total number of ways to select 3 men and 3 women out of 7 men and 4 women is the product of the above two values, i.e., 35*4 = 140. Therefore, the correct answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the calculated value of 140. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Amanda goes to the toy store to buy 1 ball and 3 different board games. If the toy store is stocked with 3 types of balls and 6 types of board games, how many different selections E of the 4 items can Amanda make? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 12 (C) 14 (D) 15 (E) 60\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Amanda can choose 1 ball out of 3 types of balls. This can be done in 3 ways. Next, she can choose 3 board games out of 6 types of board games. This can be done in 6C3 ways, which is equal to 20. Therefore, the total number of different selections E of the 4 items that Amanda can make is 3 x 20 = 60. So, the correct answer is (E) 60. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
