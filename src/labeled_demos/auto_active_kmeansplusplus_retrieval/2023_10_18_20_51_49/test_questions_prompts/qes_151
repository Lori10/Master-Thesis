  "test_question": "Q: If 10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number the result is equal to sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number. Find the number Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 160 (C) 150 (D) 210 (E) 220",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If two numbers are in the ratio 1:2. If 10 is added to both of the numbers then the ratio becomes 2:3 then find the smallest number? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 20 (C) 30 (D) 40 (E) 50\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the two numbers be x and 2x (since they are in the ratio 1:2). When 10 is added to both numbers, the new numbers become x+10 and 2x+10. The new ratio is 2:3, so we can set up the equation: (x+10)/(2x+10) = 2/3 Cross-multiplying gives us: 3(x+10) = 2(2x+10) Simplifying: 3x + 30 = 4x + 20 x = 10 Therefore, the smallest number is x = 10. The answer is (A) 10. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: When 1/10 percent of 2,000 is subtracted from 1/10 of 2,000, the difference is Answer Choices: (A)  0 (B)  198 (C)  450 (D)  495 (E)  500\nA: Let's think step by step. 1/10 percent of 2,000 is equal to (1/10)*(1/100)*2,000 = 2. 1/10 of 2,000 is equal to 200. So, when we subtract 2 from 200, we get 198. Therefore, the answer is (B) 198. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: One half of a two digit number exceeds its one third by 6. What is the sum of the digits of the number? Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 5 (C) 7 (D) 9 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the two-digit number to be 'xy', where x is the tens digit and y is the units digit. According to the problem, 1/2(xy) - 1/3(xy) = 6 Multiplying both sides by 6, we get: 3xy - 2xy = 36 xy = 36 Now we know that the two-digit number is 36. The sum of the digits of the number is 3 + 6 = 9. Therefore, the answer is (D) 9. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: One half of a two digit number exceeds its one third by 9. What is the sum of the digits of the number? Answer Choices: (A) A) 3 (B) B) 5 (C) C) 7 (D) D) 9 (E) E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the two-digit number is represented by 'xy', where x is the tens digit and y is the units digit. According to the problem, we can write the following equation: 1/2(xy) - 1/3(xy) = 9 Simplifying this equation, we get: xy/6 = 9 Multiplying both sides by 6, we get: xy = 54 Therefore, the two-digit number is 54. The sum of the digits of the number is 5 + 4 = 9. So, the correct answer is (D) 9. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
