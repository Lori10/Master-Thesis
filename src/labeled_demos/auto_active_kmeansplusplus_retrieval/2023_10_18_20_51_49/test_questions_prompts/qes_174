  "test_question": "Q: Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, while Jennie bikes at 20. How long until they have collectively biked 1 mile? Answer Choices: (A) 1 minute (B) 2 minutes (C) 3 minutes (D) 4 minutes (E) 5 minutes",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: What is the time required for a bike to cover a distance of 450 km with a speed of 90 kmh? Answer Choices: (A) 5 hours (B) 3 hours (C) 8 hours (D) 6 hours (E) 4 hours\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed Plugging in the given values, we get: time = 450 km / 90 km/h Simplifying, we get: time = 5 hours Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 5 hours. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: James took a 3-hour bike ride. In the second hour he travlled 18 miles, which was 20 percent farther than he traveled the first hour. If he traveled 25 percent farther in the third hour than he did in the second hour, how many miles did jose travel during the entire ride? Answer Choices: (A) 54.0 (B) 54.9 (C) 55.5 (D) 57.0 (E) 63.0\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how far James traveled in the first hour. We know that in the second hour he traveled 20% farther than in the first hour, so we can set up the equation: 18 = 1.2x where x is the distance James traveled in the first hour. Solving for x, we get: x = 15 Next, we need to find out how far James traveled in the third hour. We know that in the third hour he traveled 25% farther than in the second hour, so we can set up the equation: d = 1.25(18) where d is the distance James traveled in the third hour. Solving for d, we get: d = 22.5 Finally, we can add up the distances traveled in each hour to find the total distance traveled: total distance = 15 + 18 + 22.5 = 55.5 Therefore, the answer is (C) 55.5. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Three friends-whose walking rates are 1 ft./sec., 3ft./sec.,and 6ft./sec. start together walking in the same direction around a circular track that is 420 feet in circumference.After how many minutes are the three of them together again? Answer Choices: (A) 5 mins (B) 10 mins (C) 15 mins (D) 3 mins (E) 7 mins\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for each friend to complete one full lap around the track. We can use the formula: time = distance / rate For the friend with a walking rate of 1 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 1 ft./sec. = 420 sec. For the friend with a walking rate of 3 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 3 ft./sec. = 140 sec. For the friend with a walking rate of 6 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 6 ft./sec. = 70 sec. Now we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these three times, which will give us the time it takes for all three friends to be together again. The LCM of 420 sec., 140 sec., and 70 sec. is 420 sec. Converting 420 sec. to minutes, we get: 420 sec. / 60 sec./min. = 7 min. Therefore, the answer is (E) 7 mins. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: If Jane takes 12 seconds to run y yards, how many minutes will it take her to run x yards at the same rate? Answer Choices: (A) xy/12 (B) 12x/(60y)  (C) 60xy/12 (D) xy/720 (E) 720x/y\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find Jane's speed in yards per second. We can do this by dividing the distance she runs by the time it takes her to run it: Speed = y/12 yards per second Next, we need to find how long it will take her to run x yards at this speed. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Plugging in the values we know: Time = x / (y/12) seconds To convert this to minutes, we need to divide by 60: Time = (x / (y/12)) / 60 minutes Simplifying: Time = (x * 12) / (y * 60) minutes Therefore, the answer is (B) 12x/(60y). The answer is B.\n\n\n"
