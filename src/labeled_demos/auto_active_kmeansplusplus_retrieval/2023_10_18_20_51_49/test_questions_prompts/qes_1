  "test_question": "Q: Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If John takes 4 minutes to eat x raisins, how many seconds will it take him to eat z raisins, assuming he continues to eat at the same rate? Answer Choices: (A) 240z/x (B) 4xz (C) 240x/z (D) 240xz (E) 4z/x\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many raisins John can eat in one minute. We can do this by dividing x by 4 (since he eats x raisins in 4 minutes): x/4 Now we need to find out how many seconds it will take him to eat z raisins. We can set up a proportion: x/4 = z/t where t is the time it takes him to eat z raisins in seconds. We can solve for t: t = 4z/x Therefore, the answer is (E) 4z/x. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Two pipes A and B can fill a cistern in 10 and 15 minutes respectively. Both fill pipes are opened together,but at the end of 3 minutes, \u2018B\u2019 is turned off. How much time will the cistern take to fill ? Answer Choices: (A) 6 min (B) 8 min (C) 10 min (D) 12 min (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the capacity of the cistern is 'x' liters. In one minute, pipe A can fill 1/10th of the cistern, and pipe B can fill 1/15th of the cistern. When both pipes are opened together, they can fill 1/10 + 1/15 = 1/6th of the cistern in one minute. After 3 minutes, the cistern would have been filled with 3/6th or 1/2 of its capacity. Now, only pipe A is filling the remaining 1/2 of the cistern. In one minute, pipe A can fill 1/10th of the cistern. Therefore, the time taken to fill the remaining 1/2 of the cistern by pipe A alone would be 1/2 \u00f7 1/10 = 5 minutes. Therefore, the total time taken to fill the cistern would be 3 + 5 = 8 minutes. Hence, the correct answer is option (B) 8 min. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: One fill pipe A is 3 times faster than second fill pipe B and takes 10 minutes less time to fill a cistern than B takes. Find when the cistern will be full if fill pipe B is only opened. Answer Choices: (A) 20 min (B) 18 min (C) 15 min (D) 10 min (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the time taken by fill pipe B to fill the cistern is x minutes. According to the problem, fill pipe A is 3 times faster than fill pipe B. Therefore, the time taken by fill pipe A to fill the cistern will be x/3 minutes. Also, it is given that fill pipe A takes 10 minutes less time than fill pipe B to fill the cistern. Therefore, we can write the equation: x - 10 = x/3 Solving this equation, we get: 2x/3 = 10 x = 15 Therefore, fill pipe B takes 15 minutes to fill the cistern. Hence, the answer is (C) 15 min. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A, B can Complete a work in 15 days &10 days respectively. They started doing thework together after 2 days B had to leave and A alone completed the remaining work.The whole work wascompleted in how many days? Answer Choices: (A) 8 days (B) 10 days (C) 12 days (D) 14 days (E) 16 days\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the total work is 150 units (LCM of 15 and 10). In one day, A can complete 10 units of work (150/15) and B can complete 15 units of work (150/10). Together, in one day, they can complete 25 units of work (10+15). After 2 days, the total work completed by A and B together is 50 units (25*2). So, the remaining work is 100 units (150-50). Now, A alone has to complete 100 units of work. In one day, A can complete 10 units of work. Therefore, A will take 10 days to complete the remaining work (100/10). So, the total number of days taken to complete the work is 2+10 = 12 days. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 12 days. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
