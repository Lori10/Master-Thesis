  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In a single throw of a die, what is the probability of getting a number greater than 4? Answer Choices: (A) 1/2 (B) 1/3 (C) 2/3 (D) 1/4 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. There are six possible outcomes when a die is thrown, which are the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Out of these six outcomes, only two are greater than 4, which are 5 and 6. Therefore, the probability of getting a number greater than 4 is 2/6 or 1/3. So, the correct answer is (B) 1/3. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If you roll one fair six-sided die, what is the probability that the number is even or less than 4? Answer Choices: (A) 1/6 (B) 1/3 (C) 2/ 3 (D) 3/4 (E) 5/6\nA: Let's think step by step. There are three even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. There are also two odd numbers less than 4: 1 and 3. So, there are a total of 5 outcomes that satisfy the condition of being even or less than 4. The probability of rolling one of these outcomes is therefore 5/6. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 5/6. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: If 2 dice are rolled, what is the probability of the total score being a even number? Answer Choices: (A) 1/4 (B) 1/3 (C) 5/12 (D) 1/2 (E) 7/12\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice, as each die has 6 possible outcomes. To find the probability of rolling an even total, we need to count the number of outcomes where the sum is even. One way to approach this is to consider the possible outcomes for each die separately. For the first die, there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) and 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5). For the second die, the same is true. So we can use a table to count the number of outcomes where the sum is even: | | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | |---|---|---|---|---|---|---| | 1 | | | | | | | | 2 | | X | | X | | X | | 3 | | | | | | | | 4 | | X | | X | | X | | 5 | | | | | | | | 6 | | X | | X | | X | Each X represents an outcome where the sum is even. Counting the X's, we see that there are 18 even outcomes out of 36 total outcomes. So the probability of rolling an even total is 18/36, which simplifies to 1/2. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 1/2. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: 5 persons A,B,C,D and E occupy seats in a row at random. What is the probability that A and B sit next to each other ? Answer Choices: (A) 3/5 (B) 2/5 (C) 1/5 (D) 8/5 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 5 people, so there are 5! = 120 ways to arrange them in a row. Now, let's consider A and B as a single entity, AB. Then, there are 4! = 24 ways to arrange the entities AB, C, D, and E in a row. However, within the entity AB, there are 2! = 2 ways to arrange A and B. So, there are 2 x 4! = 48 ways for A and B to sit next to each other. Therefore, the probability of A and B sitting next to each other is 48/120 = 2/5. The correct answer is (B) 2/5. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
