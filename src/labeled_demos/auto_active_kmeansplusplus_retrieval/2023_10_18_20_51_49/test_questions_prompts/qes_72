At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join?

  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A and B invests Rs.8000 and Rs.9000 in a business. After 4 months, A withdraws half of his capital and 2 months later, B withdraws one-third of his capital. In what ratio should they share the profits at the end of the year? Answer Choices: (A) 32:45 (B) 32:37 (C) 32:41 (D) 32:47 (E) 32:48\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. Let the total profit be x. A invests Rs.8000 and B invests Rs.9000. After 4 months, A withdraws half of his capital, which means he withdraws Rs.4000. So, A's investment for the remaining 8 months is Rs.4000. B does not withdraw any amount after 4 months. After 6 months (2 months after A's withdrawal), B withdraws one-third of his capital, which means he withdraws Rs.3000. So, B's investment for the remaining 6 months is Rs.6000. Now, let's calculate the ratio of their investments for the entire year. A's investment for the year = (4/12)*8000 + (8/12)*4000 = 2667 + 2667 = 5334 B's investment for the year = (6/12)*9000 + (6/12)*6000 = 4500 + 3000 = 7500 Therefore, the ratio of their investments for the entire year is 5334:7500, which simplifies to 32:45. Hence, the answer is (A) 32:45. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A and B invests Rs.2500 and Rs.4000 respectively in a business. If A doubles his capital after 6 months. In what ratio should A and B divide that year's profit? Answer Choices: (A) 11:5 (B) 15:16 (C) 15:2 (D) 9:9 (E) 11:1\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total investment made by A and B. Total investment = Rs.2500 + Rs.4000 = Rs.6500 After 6 months, A doubles his capital. So, his new investment becomes Rs.5000. Now, the ratio of their investments is: A:B = Rs.5000 : Rs.4000 = 5:4 Let's assume that the total profit for the year is Rs.X. A's share of profit = (5/9) X B's share of profit = (4/9) X Therefore, the ratio in which they should divide the profit is: A:B = (5/9) X : (4/9) X = 5:4 So, the correct answer is (D) 9:9. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A invested $300 in a business after 6 months B invested $200 in the business. End of the year if they got $100 as profit. Find A shares? Answer Choices: (A) $100 (B) $75 (C) $20 (D) $120 (E) $50\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total investment made by A and B. A invested $300 for 12 months, so his total investment is $300 * 12 = $3600. B invested $200 for 12 months, so his total investment is $200 * 12 = $2400. Next, we need to find the ratio of their investments. A invested $3600 and B invested $2400, so the ratio of their investments is 3600:2400, which simplifies to 3:2. Now, we need to find A's share of the profit. Since the ratio of their investments is 3:2, A's share of the profit is 3/5 of the total profit. Therefore, A's share of the profit is $100 * 3/5 = $60. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above, as none of the given answer choices match the calculated answer of $60. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A and B together invested Rs. 9,000 in a business. At the end of the year, out of total profit is Rs. 3,000 B's share was Rs. 1500. A's investment was Answer Choices: (A) s. 4,500 (B) s. 8,250 (C) s. 10,500 (D) s. 11,250 (E) s. 12,250\nA: Let's think step by step. Let A's investment be x. Then, B's investment will be (9000-x). Now, we know that out of the total profit of Rs. 3000, B's share was Rs. 1500. So, A's share will be (3000-1500) = Rs. 1500. We can set up the following equation: (B's share of profit) / (A's share of profit) = (B's investment) / (A's investment) 1500 / 1500 = (9000-x) / x Simplifying this equation, we get: 1 = (9000-x) / x x = Rs. 4500 Therefore, A's investment was Rs. 4500. The correct answer is (A) Rs. 4,500. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
