  "test_question": "Q: In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: When 1/10 percent of 2,000 is subtracted from 1/10 of 2,000, the difference is Answer Choices: (A)  0 (B)  198 (C)  450 (D)  495 (E)  500\nA: Let's think step by step. 1/10 percent of 2,000 is equal to (1/10)*(1/100)*2,000 = 2. 1/10 of 2,000 is equal to 200. So, when we subtract 2 from 200, we get 198. Therefore, the answer is (B) 198. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: At a contest with 2,500 participants, 1/2 of the people are aged 10 to 12. Next year, the number of people aged 10 to 12 will increase by 1/5. After this change, what percentage of the total 2,500 people will the 10- to 12-year-olds represent? Answer Choices: (A) 55% (B) 60% (C) 50% (D) 45% (E) 66%\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 at the contest. 1/2 of 2,500 = 1,250 people aged 10 to 12. Step 2: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1/5 of 1,250 = 250 people increase. 1,250 + 250 = 1,500 people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. Step 3: Find the percentage of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1,500/2,500 x 100% = 60% Therefore, the answer is (B) 60%. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: 10% of the inhabitants of a village having died of cholera, a panic set in, during which 25% of the remaining inhabitants left the village. The population is then reduced to 4050. Find the number of original inhabitants. Answer Choices: (A) 5000 (B) 6000 (C) 7000 (D) 8000 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Let the original number of inhabitants be x. Step 2: 10% of the inhabitants died of cholera, so the number of remaining inhabitants is 0.9x. Step 3: During the panic, 25% of the remaining inhabitants left, so the number of remaining inhabitants is 0.75(0.9x) = 0.675x. Step 4: We know that the current population is 4050, so we can set up an equation: 0.675x = 4050. Step 5: Solving for x, we get x = 6000. Therefore, the number of original inhabitants was 6000. The answer is (B) 6000. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Of the 600 residents of Clermontville, 35% watch the television show Island Survival, 40% watch Lovelost Lawyers and 50% watch Medical Emergency. If all residents watch at least one of these three shows and 18% watch exactly 2 of these shows, then how many Clermontville residents B watch all of the shows? Answer Choices: (A)  150 (B)  108 (C)  42 (D)  21 (E)  -21\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of residents who watch at least one of the three shows. 35% + 40% + 50% = 125% This means that some residents are being counted twice or even thrice. To find the actual percentage, we need to subtract the percentage of residents who watch exactly two shows and the percentage of residents who watch all three shows. Step 2: Find the percentage of residents who watch exactly two shows. 125% - 18% = 107% Step 3: Find the percentage of residents who watch all three shows. 107% - 100% = 7% Step 4: Find the total number of residents who watch all three shows. 7% of 600 = 42 Therefore, the answer is (C) 42. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
