  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Find a 8 digit number that if multiplied by the number 9 or any of its multiplications products (18, 27, 36, 45,..) will result in the multiplication factor repeated (n) number of times. Answer Choices: (A) 12435687 (B) 12345679 (C) 10000000 (D) 99999999 (E) 11111111\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find a number that has 8 digits. Let's start with the number 12345678. Next, we need to check if this number satisfies the given condition. If we multiply it by 9, we get 111111102. This doesn't satisfy the condition because the multiplication factor (1) is not repeated any number of times. Let's try the next number, 12345679. If we multiply it by 9, we get 111111111. This satisfies the condition because the multiplication factor (1) is repeated 8 times. Therefore, the answer is (B) 12345679. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In the above number, A and B represent the tens and units digits, respectively. If the above number is divisible by 25, what is the greatest possible value of B x A? Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 15 (C) 20 (D) 25 (E) 35\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that a number is divisible by 25 if and only if its last two digits are divisible by 25. Therefore, we need to find the possible values of AB that are divisible by 25. The units digit B can only be 0, 5, or 10 (since it is a multiple of 5). If B is 0, then AB is also 0 and the product is 0. If B is 5, then AB is either 15 or 25. If B is 10, then AB is either 20 or 30. Out of these options, the greatest possible value of B x A is 25, which occurs when B is 5 and A is 5. Therefore, the answer is (D) 25. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: How many three-digit whole numbers yield a remainder of 1 when divided by 10 and also yield a remainder of 1 when divided by 6? Answer Choices: (A) None (B) One (C) Two (D) Three (E) Four\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 10. These numbers are of the form 10a + 1, where a is an integer. Next, we need to find the numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 6. These numbers are of the form 6b + 1, where b is an integer. To find the numbers that satisfy both conditions, we need to find the values of a and b that make 10a + 1 and 6b + 1 equal. 10a + 1 = 6b + 1 Simplifying, we get: 10a = 6b Dividing both sides by 2, we get: 5a = 3b This means that a must be a multiple of 3 and b must be a multiple of 5. The smallest three-digit number that satisfies both conditions is 121 (10*12+1). The next number is 181 (10*18+1). Therefore, the answer is (C) Two. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: How many numbers from 2 to 8 are exactly divisible by 2? Answer Choices: (A) A) 2 (B) B) 4 (C) C) 5 (D) D) 7 (E) E) 8\nA: Let's think step by step. We need to find the numbers from 2 to 8 that are exactly divisible by 2. Divisible by 2 means that the number can be divided by 2 without leaving any remainder. The numbers from 2 to 8 are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Out of these, the numbers that are exactly divisible by 2 are: 2, 4, 6, 8. So, the answer is (B) 4. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
