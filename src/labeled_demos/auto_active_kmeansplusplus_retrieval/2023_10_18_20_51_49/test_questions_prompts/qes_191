  "test_question": "Q: It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour? Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A driver covers a certain distance by car driving at 60 km/hr and returns back to the starting point riding on a scooter at 10 km/hr. What was the average speed for the whole journey? Answer Choices: (A) 14.2 km/h (B) 17.1 km/h (C) 19.3 km/h (D) 21.7 km/h (E) 23.5 km/h\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the distance covered by the driver is 'd' km. The time taken to cover the distance by car at 60 km/hr is given by: Time taken = Distance/Speed = d/60 The time taken to cover the same distance by scooter at 10 km/hr is given by: Time taken = Distance/Speed = d/10 The total time taken for the whole journey is the sum of the time taken for the onward journey and the time taken for the return journey. Total time taken = d/60 + d/10 = (d + 6d)/60 = 7d/60 The average speed for the whole journey is given by: Average speed = Total distance/Total time taken Total distance = 2d (since the driver covers the same distance twice) Average speed = 2d/(7d/60) = 120/7 km/hr Rounding off to one decimal place, we get the answer as (A) 14.2 km/h. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: What is the time required for a bike to cover a distance of 450 km with a speed of 90 kmh? Answer Choices: (A) 5 hours (B) 3 hours (C) 8 hours (D) 6 hours (E) 4 hours\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed Plugging in the given values, we get: time = 450 km / 90 km/h Simplifying, we get: time = 5 hours Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 5 hours. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A person crosses a 600 m long street in 2 minutes. What is his speed in km per hour? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 24 (C) 18 (D) 42 (E) 64\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the distance from meters to kilometers. We can do this by dividing 600 by 1000, which gives us 0.6 km. Next, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. We can do this by dividing 2 by 60, which gives us 0.0333 hours (rounded to four decimal places). Finally, we can calculate the speed by dividing the distance by the time. So, speed = distance/time = 0.6/0.0333 = 18 (rounded to the nearest whole number). Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 18. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If a truck is traveling at a constant rate of 54 kilometers per hour, how many seconds will it take the truck to travel a distance of 600 meters? (1 kilometer = 1000 meters) Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 24 (C) 30 (D) 36 (E) 40\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the truck from kilometers per hour to meters per second since the distance given is in meters. 54 kilometers per hour = 54,000 meters per hour (since 1 kilometer = 1000 meters) = 15 meters per second (since 1 hour = 3600 seconds) Now, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time Plugging in the values we have: 600 meters = 15 meters per second x time Solving for time: time = 600 meters / 15 meters per second time = 40 seconds Therefore, the answer is (E) 40. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
