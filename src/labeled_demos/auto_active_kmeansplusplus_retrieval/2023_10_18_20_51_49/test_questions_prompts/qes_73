  "formatted_prompt": "Q: It takes 40 identical printing presses 15 hours to print 500,000 papers. How many hours would it take 30 of these printing presses to print 500,000 papers? Answer Choices: (A) 16 (B) 18 (C) 20 (D) 21 (E) 24\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 40 printing presses can print 500,000 papers in 15 hours. So, we can find the rate of printing of each press by dividing the total number of papers by the total number of hours and the number of presses: Rate of each press = 500,000 / (40 x 15) = 833.33 papers per hour Now, we need to find how many hours it would take 30 printing presses to print 500,000 papers at the same rate. Total time = Total number of papers / (Rate of each press x Number of presses) Total time = 500,000 / (833.33 x 30) Total time = 20 hours Therefore, the answer is (C) 20. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A group of 55 adults and 70 children go for trekking. If there is meal for either 70 adults or 90 children and if 28 adults have their meal, find the total number of children that can be catered with the remaining food. Answer Choices: (A) 42 (B) 54 (C) 90 (D) 70 (E) 80\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that there are 55 adults and 70 children, so the total number of people is 55 + 70 = 125. Step 2: We also know that there is enough food for either 70 adults or 90 children. Since there are only 55 adults, we can assume that the remaining food is for the children. Step 3: 28 adults have already had their meal, so the number of adults left is 55 - 28 = 27. Step 4: We need to find out how many children can be catered with the remaining food. Since the remaining food is for either 70 adults or 90 children, we can set up a proportion: 70 adults = 90 children 1 adult = 90/70 children 27 adults = (90/70) x 27 children 27 adults = 34.29 children (rounded to two decimal places) Step 5: Since we can't have a fraction of a child, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the total number of children that can be catered with the remaining food is 35. Answer: None of the above (the closest option is A, but it is not the correct answer). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: 15 men take 20 days of 8 hours each to do a piece of work. How many days of 6 hours each would 21 women take to do the same. If 3 women do as much work as 2 men? Answer Choices: (A) 27.57 (B) 28.57 (C) 29.57 (D) 30.57 (E) 32\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total work done by 15 men in 20 days of 8 hours each. 15 men take 20 days of 8 hours each to do a piece of work. So, the total work done by 15 men = 15 * 20 * 8 = 2400 man-hours. Step 2: Find the work done by 1 man in 1 hour. The work done by 1 man in 1 hour = Total work done by 15 men / (15 * 20) = 2400 / 300 = 8 man-hours. Step 3: Find the work done by 1 woman in 1 hour. 3 women do as much work as 2 men. So, the work done by 1 woman in 1 hour = Work done by 2 men in 1 hour / 3 = 2 * 8 / 3 = 16 / 3 woman-hours. Step 4: Find the total work done by 21 women in x days of 6 hours each. Let the total work done by 21 women in x days of 6 hours each be y woman-hours. So, y = 21 * x * 6 * (16 / 3) = 672x woman-hours. Step 5: Equate the work done by 15 men and 21 women. 2400 man-hours = 672x woman-hours. x = 2400 / (672 * (16 / 3)) = 30.57 days. Therefore, the answer is (D) 30.57. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Calculate how many men are needed to finish a specific task in 5 days if it will take 15 men to complete the same task in 10 days. ? Answer Choices: (A) 13 (B) 16 (C) 35 (D) 25 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the formula: (number of men) x (number of days) = (amount of work) Let's call the number of men needed to finish the task in 5 days \"x\". So we have: x * 5 = 15 * 10 Simplifying: x = 30 Therefore, 30 men are needed to finish the task in 5 days. Answer: None of the above (not one of the answer choices is 30). The answer is A.\n\n\n"
