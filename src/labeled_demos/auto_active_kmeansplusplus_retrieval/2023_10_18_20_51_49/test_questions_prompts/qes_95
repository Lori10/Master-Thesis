  "test_question": "Q: A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Train A and Train B began traveling towards each other from opposite ends of a 480-mile long track at 1:00 PM. If Train A traveled at 35 miles per hour and Train B traveled at 25 miles per hour, at what time did the trains meet? Answer Choices: (A) 5:40 PM (B) 6:00 PM (C) 7:20 PM (D) 9:00 PM (E) 9:20 PM\nA: Let's think step by step. We can start by using the formula: distance = rate x time. Let's call the time it takes for the trains to meet \"t\". Train A travels at 35 miles per hour, so in time \"t\", it will travel a distance of 35t. Train B travels at 25 miles per hour, so in time \"t\", it will travel a distance of 25t. Since the trains are traveling towards each other, the total distance they will cover is 480 miles. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 35t + 25t = 480 Simplifying: 60t = 480 t = 8 So the trains will meet 8 hours after they started, which would be at 9:00 PM. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 9:00 PM. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Two stations A and B are 110 km apart on a straight line. One train starts from A at 7 a.m. and travels towards B at 20 kmph. Another train starts from B at 8 a.m. and travels towards A at a speed of 25 kmph. At what time will they meet? Answer Choices: (A) 39 (B) 10 (C) 88 (D) 12 (E) 18\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much distance the first train covers before the second train starts. The first train starts at 7 a.m. and the second train starts at 8 a.m., which means the first train has a one-hour head start. In one hour, the first train covers a distance of 20 km. Now, let's assume that the two trains meet after t hours. In that case, the second train would have traveled for t - 1 hours. Let's use the formula: distance = speed x time Distance covered by the first train + Distance covered by the second train = Total distance between the two stations 20t + 25(t-1) = 110 Simplifying the equation, we get: 45t = 135 t = 3 Therefore, the two trains will meet after 3 hours. The first train started at 7 a.m., so it will meet the second train at 10 a.m. Hence, the correct answer is (B) 10. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Two trains 110 m and 160 m long run at the speed of 60 km/hr and 40 km/hr respectively in opposite directions on parallel tracks. The time which they take to cross each other is? Answer Choices: (A) 10.9 (B) 10.7 (C) 10.3 (D) 10.8 (E) 9.72\nA: Let's think step by step. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds, which is 60 + 40 = 100 km/hr. We need to convert this to meters per second (m/s) to match the units of the lengths of the trains. We know that 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s, so: 100 km/hr = (100 x 5/18) m/s = 250/9 m/s Now we can use the formula: time = distance / speed The distance that the two trains need to cover to cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is 110 + 160 = 270 m. Plugging in the values, we get: time = 270 / (250/9) = 10.8 seconds Therefore, the answer is (D) 10.8. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A train is 320 meter long is running at a speed of 45 km/hour. In what time will it pass a bridge of 140 meter length? Answer Choices: (A) 11 seconds (B) 38 seconds (C) 40 seconds (D) 88 seconds (E) 36.8 seconds\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed from km/hour to m/s. 45 km/hour = (45 * 1000) / (60 * 60) m/s = 12.5 m/s Next, we need to find the total distance the train will cover when passing the bridge. Total distance = length of train + length of bridge = 320 + 140 = 460 meters Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed time = 460 / 12.5 = 36.8 seconds Therefore, the answer is (E) 36.8 seconds. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
