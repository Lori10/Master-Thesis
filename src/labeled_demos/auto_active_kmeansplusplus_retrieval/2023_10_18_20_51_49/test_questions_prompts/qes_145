  "formatted_prompt": "Q: 1/0.025 is equal to Answer Choices: (A) 25.5 (B) 2.5 (C) 40 (D) .25 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. We can simplify 1/0.025 by dividing 1 by 0.025. 1 \u00f7 0.025 = 40 Therefore, the answer is (C) 40. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The ratio 5:20 expressed as percent equals to Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 125 % (C) 25 % (D) None of above (E) 30%\nA: Let's think step by step. The ratio 5:20 can be simplified by dividing both numbers by 5. 5:20 = 1:4 Now, we need to convert this ratio to a percentage. To do this, we need to find out what percentage 1 is of 4. 1 is 25% of 4. Therefore, the answer is (C) 25%. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In a certain sequence, the first term is 1, and each successive term is 1 more than the reciprocal of the term that immediately precedes it. What is the fifth term in this sequence? Answer Choices: (A) 13/8 (B) 21/13 (C) 8/5 (D) 5/8 (E) 8/13\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We are given a sequence where the first term is 1. Let's write down the first few terms of the sequence to see if we can spot a pattern: First term: 1 Second term: 1 + 1/1 = 2 Third term: 1 + 1/2 = 3/2 Fourth term: 1 + 2/3 = 5/3 To find the fifth term, we need to add 1 to the reciprocal of the fourth term: Fifth term: 1 + 3/5 = 8/5 So the answer is (C) 8/5. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If 288 is divided into four parts proportional to 5, 7, 4, 8 then the smallest part is : Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 44 (C) 20 (D) 48 (E) 42\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total proportion: 5 + 7 + 4 + 8 = 24 Next, we need to find the proportion of each part: 5/24, 7/24, 4/24, 8/24 Simplifying these fractions, we get: 5/24, 7/24, 1/6, 1/3 Now, we can find the value of each part by multiplying its proportion by the total value: 5/24 x 288 = 60 7/24 x 288 = 84 1/6 x 288 = 48 1/3 x 288 = 96 Therefore, the smallest part is 48, which corresponds to the proportion of 1/6. The correct answer is (D) 48. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
