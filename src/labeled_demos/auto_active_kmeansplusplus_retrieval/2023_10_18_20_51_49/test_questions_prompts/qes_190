  "test_question": "Q: The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 28 (C) 30 (D) 53 (E) 59",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Five drainage pipes, each draining water from a pool at the same constant rate, together can drain a certain pool in 12 days. How many additional pipes, each draining water at the same constant rate, will be needed to drain the pool in 6 days? Answer Choices: (A)  5 (B)  9 (C)  10 (D)  12 (E)  15\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to understand that the rate of draining water is constant for each pipe. Let's say the rate of each pipe is x. We know that 5 pipes can drain the pool in 12 days. So, the total amount of water in the pool is 5x * 12 = 60x. Now, we want to drain the same pool in half the time, which is 6 days. So, the total amount of water drained should be the same, which is 60x. Let's say we need n additional pipes to drain the pool in 6 days. So, the total number of pipes will be 5 + n. We can use the formula: total amount of water drained = rate * time 60x = (5 + n) * x * 6 Simplifying this equation, we get: 60x = 30x + 6nx 30x = 6nx n = 5 Therefore, we need 5 additional pipes to drain the pool in 6 days. The answer is (A) 5. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A, B can Complete a work in 15 days &10 days respectively. They started doing thework together after 2 days B had to leave and A alone completed the remaining work.The whole work wascompleted in how many days? Answer Choices: (A) 8 days (B) 10 days (C) 12 days (D) 14 days (E) 16 days\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the total work is 150 units (LCM of 15 and 10). In one day, A can complete 10 units of work (150/15) and B can complete 15 units of work (150/10). Together, in one day, they can complete 25 units of work (10+15). After 2 days, the total work completed by A and B together is 50 units (25*2). So, the remaining work is 100 units (150-50). Now, A alone has to complete 100 units of work. In one day, A can complete 10 units of work. Therefore, A will take 10 days to complete the remaining work (100/10). So, the total number of days taken to complete the work is 2+10 = 12 days. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 12 days. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A cistern is normally filled in 4 hrs,but takes 2 hrs longer to fill because of a leak on its bottom,if Cistern is full ,how much time citern would empty? Answer Choices: (A) 10 hours (B) 20 hours (C) 30 hours (D) 40 hours (E) 12 hours\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the cistern's capacity is 1 unit (it could be any unit of measurement). If there was no leak, the cistern would be filled in 4 hours. So, the rate of filling would be 1/4 units per hour. But because of the leak, it takes 2 hours longer to fill the cistern. So, the new time taken to fill the cistern is 4 + 2 = 6 hours. Let's assume that the leak can empty the cistern in x hours. Now, we can set up an equation based on the principle that the amount of water filled in the cistern is equal to the amount of water emptied by the leak when the cistern is full. Amount of water filled = Amount of water emptied Rate of filling x Time taken to fill = Rate of emptying x Time taken to empty 1 = (1/4) x 6 + (1/x) x t where t is the time taken to empty the cistern when it is full. Simplifying the equation, we get: 1 = (3/2) + (t/x) (t/x) = 1/2 t = (x/2) So, the time taken to empty the cistern when it is full is half the time taken by the leak to empty it. Since we don't know the time taken by the leak to empty the cistern, we cannot determine the exact answer. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Jill has 21 gallons of water stored in quart, half-gallon, and one gallon jars. She has equal numbers of each size jar holding the liquid. What is the total number of water filled jars? Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 6 (C) 9 (D) 36 (E) 14\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert all the jars to the same unit, either quarts, half-gallons, or gallons. Let's convert everything to quarts since it's the smallest unit. One gallon is equal to 4 quarts, so Jill has 21 x 4 = 84 quarts of water. Let's say she has x jars of each size. Each quart jar contains 1 quart of water, each half-gallon jar contains 2 quarts of water, and each gallon jar contains 4 quarts of water. So we can set up the equation: 1x + 2x + 4x = 84 7x = 84 x = 12 Therefore, Jill has 12 jars of each size, for a total of 3 x 12 = 36 jars. The answer is (D) 36. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
