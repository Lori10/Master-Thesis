  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Mohit sold an article for Rs. 18000. Had he offered a discount of 10% on the selling price, he would have earned a profit of 8%. What is the cost price of the article? Answer Choices: (A) 15000 (B) 15002 (C) 26879 (D) 26992 (E) 12681\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the cost price of the article be x. If Mohit had offered a discount of 10%, the selling price would have been 90% of the original selling price, which is 0.9 * 18000 = 16200. If he had earned a profit of 8%, the cost price would have been (16200/1.08) = 15000. Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 15000. The correct answer is (A) 15000. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A shopkeeper sells 200 metres of cloth for Rs. 12000 at a loss of Rs.6 per metre. Find his cost price for one metre of cloth? Answer Choices: (A) s.59 (B) s.58 (C) s.09 (D) s.50 (E) s.66\nA: Let's think step by step. The shopkeeper sold 200 meters of cloth for Rs. 12000, which means he sold each meter for Rs. 60 (12000/200). Now, we know that he sold each meter at a loss of Rs. 6. So, his cost price for each meter would be Rs. 66 (60+6). Therefore, the correct answer is (E) Rs. 66. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: The cash difference between the selling prices of an article at a profit of 2% and 4% is Rs 3. The ratio of two selling prices is Answer Choices: (A) 51:52 (B) 52:53 (C) 53:54 (D) 54:55 (E) 51:52\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the cost price of the article be x. Selling price at a profit of 2% = 1.02x Selling price at a profit of 4% = 1.04x Given, the cash difference between the selling prices = Rs 3 So, 1.04x - 1.02x = 3 0.02x = 3 x = 150 Therefore, the selling price at a profit of 2% = 1.02 x 150 = Rs 153 The selling price at a profit of 4% = 1.04 x 150 = Rs 156 The ratio of the two selling prices = 153:156 Simplifying the ratio, we get 51:52 Hence, the answer is (A) 51:52. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A man sells an article at a gain 15%. If he had bought it at 10% less and sold it for 6 less, he would have gained 25%. Find the cost price of the article. Answer Choices: (A) 150 (B) 160 (C) 170 (D) 180 (E) 240\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the cost price of the article be x. According to the question, he sells the article at a gain of 15%, so the selling price would be 1.15x. Now, if he had bought it at 10% less, the cost price would be 0.9x. And if he had sold it for 6 less, the selling price would be 1.15x - 6. According to the question, if he had done this, he would have gained 25%. So, we can write: 1.15x - (1.15x - 6) = 0.25(0.9x) Simplifying this equation, we get: 6 = 0.025x x = 240 Therefore, the cost price of the article is 240. The correct answer is (E) 240. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
