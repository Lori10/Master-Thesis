  "test_question": "Q: What is 60% of 30% of 1400 grams? Answer Choices: (A) 450 gms (B) 100 gms (C) 252 gms (D) 240 gms (E) None of these",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: What percent of 9.6 kg is 28 gms ? Answer Choices: (A) 25 (B) 66 (C) 288 (D) 29 (E) 17\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 9.6 kg to grams: 9.6 kg = 9.6 x 1000 g = 9600 g Now we can set up the proportion: 28 g / 9600 g = x / 100 Solving for x: x = (28 x 100) / 9600 x = 0.29 So the answer is approximately 29%. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 29. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: You have been given a physical balance and 7 weights of 43, 45, 30, 33, 28, 37 and 55 kgs. Keeping weights on one pan and object on the other, what is the maximum you can weigh less than 145 kgs. Answer Choices: (A) 145 (B) 143 (C) 147 (D) 141 (E) 142\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the combination of weights that adds up to the maximum weight less than 145 kgs. Starting with the heaviest weight, we can add 55 kgs to the pan. Next, we can add 45 kgs to the same pan, bringing the total weight to 100 kgs. Adding the next heaviest weight, 43 kgs, would bring the total weight to 143 kgs, which is less than 145 kgs. Therefore, the maximum weight we can weigh less than 145 kgs is 143 kgs. The correct answer is (B) 143. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: By weight, liquid X makes up 0.5 percent of solution P and 1.5 percent of solution Q. If 200 grams of solution P are mixed with 800 grams of solution Q, then liquid X accounts for what percent of the weight of the resulting solution? Answer Choices: (A) 1.3% (B) 1.2% (C) 1.1% (D) 1.0% (E) 0.9%\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much liquid X is in 200 grams of solution P and 800 grams of solution Q. Liquid X in 200 grams of solution P = 0.5% of 200 grams = 1 gram Liquid X in 800 grams of solution Q = 1.5% of 800 grams = 12 grams Total liquid X in the resulting solution = 1 gram + 12 grams = 13 grams Now, we need to find out what percent of the weight of the resulting solution is 13 grams. Total weight of resulting solution = 200 grams + 800 grams = 1000 grams Percent of liquid X in the resulting solution = (13 grams / 1000 grams) x 100% = 1.3% Therefore, the answer is (A) 1.3%. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Which of the following values is the greatest Answer Choices: (A) a)  30% of 89 (B) b)  22% of 78 (C) c)  33% of 67 (D) d)  44% of 56 (E) e)  55% of 45\nA: Let's think step by step. A) 30% of 89 = 0.3 x 89 = 26.7 B) 22% of 78 = 0.22 x 78 = 17.16 C) 33% of 67 = 0.33 x 67 = 22.11 D) 44% of 56 = 0.44 x 56 = 24.64 E) 55% of 45 = 0.55 x 45 = 24.75 Therefore, the greatest value is option (E) 55% of 45. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
