  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Two employees X and Y are paid a total of Rs. 550 per week by their employer. If X is paid 120 percent of the sum paid to Y, how much is Y paid per week? Answer Choices: (A) Rs.150 (B) Rs.180 (C) Rs.200 (D) Rs.220 (E) Rs.250\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that Y is paid Rs. x per week. According to the problem, X is paid 120% of what Y is paid. So, X is paid 120/100 * x = 1.2x per week. We also know that the total amount paid to X and Y is Rs. 550 per week. So, we can write an equation: x + 1.2x = 550 Simplifying this equation, we get: 2.2x = 550 Dividing both sides by 2.2, we get: x = 250 Therefore, Y is paid Rs. 250 per week. The correct answer is (E) Rs.250. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A certain amount earns simple interest of Rs. 1750 after 7 years. Had the interest been 2% more, how much more interest would it have earned? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 35 (B) Rs. 245 (C) Rs. 350 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Given, the amount earns simple interest of Rs. 1750 after 7 years. Let the principal amount be P and the rate of interest be R. Simple Interest formula is given by: S.I. = (P * R * T) / 100 Here, S.I. = Rs. 1750, T = 7 years So, 1750 = (P * R * 7) / 100 => PR = 25000 Now, if the interest rate is increased by 2%, the new rate of interest will be R + 2. New S.I. = (P * (R + 2) * T) / 100 New S.I. - Old S.I. = [(P * (R + 2) * T) / 100] - [(P * R * T) / 100] = (P * 2 * T) / 100 = (P * 2 * 7) / 100 = (14P / 100) = 0.14P We don't know the value of P, so we cannot determine the exact amount of increased interest. Therefore, the answer is (D) Cannot be determined. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In order to obtain an income of Rs. 650 from 10% stock at Rs. 96, one must make an investment of Answer Choices: (A) 5363 (B) 6240 (C) 2368 (D) 1987 (E) 2732\nA: Let's think step by step. The annual income from the stock is 10% of the investment. So, we can set up the equation: 10% of the investment = Rs. 650 0.1 x investment = 650 investment = 650 / 0.1 investment = Rs. 6,500 Now, we need to find out how many shares can be bought with an investment of Rs. 6,500 at Rs. 96 per share. Number of shares = investment / share price Number of shares = 6,500 / 96 Number of shares = 67.71 (approx.) Since we cannot buy a fraction of a share, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Number of shares = 68 Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 2732, which is the total investment required to buy 68 shares at Rs. 96 per share. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Find the amount on Rs.8000 in 9 months at 20% per annum, if the interest being compounded quarterly? Answer Choices: (A) 2888 (B) 2690 (C) 2668 (D) 9261 (E) 2312\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve the problem step by step. Given, Principal (P) = Rs. 8000, Rate of interest (R) = 20% per annum, Time (t) = 9 months and interest is compounded quarterly. First, we need to calculate the interest rate per quarter. Rate of interest per quarter (r) = R/4 = 20/4 = 5% Now, we can use the formula for compound interest: Amount (A) = P(1 + r/100)^(n) where n is the number of quarters. n = (9 months)/3 months per quarter = 3 quarters Substituting the values, we get: A = 8000(1 + 5/100)^(3) = 8000(21/20)^3 A = 8000(9261/8000) = Rs. 9261 Therefore, the correct answer is option (D) 9261. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
