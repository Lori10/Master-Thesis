  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Kiran has 85 currency notes in all, some of which were of Rs. 100 denomination and the\nremaining of Rs. 50 denomination. The total amount of all these currency notes was Rs.\n5000. How much amount did she have in the denomination of Rs. 50?\nA. B. C. None of these D.\nAnswer: Option B\nExplanation: Answer Choices: (A) 1900 (B) 3500 (C) 4000 (D) 2000 (E) 2500\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the number of Rs. 100 notes be x and the number of Rs. 50 notes be y. We know that x + y = 85 (total number of notes) and 100x + 50y = 5000 (total amount). Simplifying the second equation, we get 2x + y = 100. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get x = 25 and y = 60. Therefore, the amount in the denomination of Rs. 50 is 50 * 60 = 3000. So, the correct answer is option B. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A and B invest in a business in the ratio 3 : 2. If 5% of the total profit goes to charity and A's share is Rs. 855, the total profit is: Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 1425 (B) Rs. 1500 (C) Rs. 1537.50 (D) Rs. 1576 (E) Rs. 1600\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the total profit be x. Since A and B invest in the ratio 3:2, their share of profit will also be in the ratio 3:2. Let A's share be 3y, and B's share be 2y. Now, we know that 5% of the total profit goes to charity. So, the remaining 95% will be divided between A and B in the ratio 3:2. Therefore, A's share will be (3/5) * 95% * x = 57% of x. We are given that A's share is Rs. 855. So, 57% of x = 855. Solving for x, we get x = Rs. 1500. Therefore, the total profit is Rs. 1500. Hence, the correct answer is option (B) Rs. 1500. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Paul's income is 40% less than Rex's income, Quentin's income is 20% less than Paul's income, and Sam's income is 40% less than Paul's income. If Rex gave 40% of his income to Sam and 60% of his income to Quentin, Quentin's new income would be what fraction of Sam's new income? Answer Choices: (A) \t11/12 (B) \t13/17 (C) \t13/19 (D) \t12/19 (E) \t27/19\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume Rex's income to be 100. Then, Paul's income would be 60 (40% less than Rex's income). Quentin's income would be 48 (20% less than Paul's income). Sam's income would be 36 (40% less than Paul's income). If Rex gave 40% of his income to Sam, Sam's new income would be 76 (40% of 100 is 40, so Rex would have 60 left to give to Quentin and keep for himself). If Rex gave 60% of his income to Quentin, Quentin's new income would be 88 (60% of 100 is 60, so Quentin would have 48 from his original income and 60 from Rex's gift). So, Quentin's new income is 88/76 = 22/19 of Sam's new income. Therefore, the answer is (E) 27/19. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Quentin's income is 60% less than Rex's income, and Ram's income is 25% less than Quentin's income. If Rex gave 60% of his income to Ram and 40% of his income to Quentin, Quentin's new income would be what fraction of Ram's new income? Answer Choices: (A) 8/9 (B) 11/12 (C) 8/13 (D) 11/13 (E) 12/13\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume Rex's income to be 100. Then Quentin's income would be 40 (60% less than Rex's income). And Ram's income would be 30 (25% less than Quentin's income). Now, if Rex gave 60% of his income to Ram, Ram's new income would be 60 (60% of 100). And if Rex gave 40% of his income to Quentin, Quentin's new income would be 40 (40% of 100). Therefore, Quentin's new income is 4/3 times his old income (40/30), and Ram's new income is 2 times his old income (60/30). So, Quentin's new income is (4/3)/(2) = 8/13 times Ram's new income. Therefore, the answer is (C) 8/13. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
