  "test_question": "Q: Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: What would happen in the previous question if both A and B had started at point P. Answer Choices: (A) 800 Km (B) 600 Km (C) 1000 Km (D) 350 Km (E) 250 Km\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that A travels at a speed of 50 km/h and B travels at a speed of 40 km/h. If they both started at point P, they would be moving in opposite directions. Let's say they meet after x hours. In that time, A would have traveled 50x km and B would have traveled 40x km. We also know that the distance between A and B is 600 km. So, we can set up the equation: 50x + 40x = 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 90x = 600 x = 6.67 hours Now that we know they meet after 6.67 hours, we can find out how far each of them has traveled: A: 50 km/h x 6.67 h = 333.33 km B: 40 km/h x 6.67 h = 266.67 km The total distance they have traveled is: 333.33 km + 266.67 km = 600 km Therefore, the answer is (B) 600 km. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: One hour after Yolanda started walking from X to Y, a distance of 24 miles, Bob started walking along the same road from Y to X. If Yolanda's walking rate was 3 miles per hour and Bob\u0442's was 4 miles per hour, how many miles had Bob walked when they met? Answer Choices: (A) 24 (B) 23 (C) 22 (D) 21 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it took Yolanda to reach the meeting point. We can use the formula distance = rate x time, where distance is 24 miles and rate is 3 miles per hour. So, time = distance / rate = 24 / 3 = 8 hours. Now, we can use the same formula to find out how far Bob walked in 8 hours at a rate of 4 miles per hour. distance = rate x time = 4 x 8 = 32 miles. However, we need to subtract the distance Yolanda walked in 8 hours to find out the distance Bob walked before they met. Yolanda walked 3 x 8 = 24 miles in 8 hours. So, Bob walked 32 - 24 = 8 miles before they met. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 8. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Two stations A and B are 110 km apart on a straight line. One train starts from A at 7 a.m. and travels towards B at 20 kmph. Another train starts from B at 8 a.m. and travels towards A at a speed of 25 kmph. At what time will they meet? Answer Choices: (A) 39 (B) 10 (C) 88 (D) 12 (E) 18\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much distance the first train covers before the second train starts. The first train starts at 7 a.m. and the second train starts at 8 a.m., which means the first train has a one-hour head start. In one hour, the first train covers a distance of 20 km. Now, let's assume that the two trains meet after t hours. In that case, the second train would have traveled for t - 1 hours. Let's use the formula: distance = speed x time Distance covered by the first train + Distance covered by the second train = Total distance between the two stations 20t + 25(t-1) = 110 Simplifying the equation, we get: 45t = 135 t = 3 Therefore, the two trains will meet after 3 hours. The first train started at 7 a.m., so it will meet the second train at 10 a.m. Hence, the correct answer is (B) 10. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A man complete a journey in 10 hours. He travels first half of the journey at the rate of 20 km/hr and second half at the rate of 20 km/hr. Find the total journey in km. Answer Choices: (A) 220 km (B) 224 km (C) 230 km (D) 232 km (E) 200 km\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the total distance be 'd' km. The man travels the first half of the journey at a speed of 20 km/hr. Therefore, he covers the first half of the distance in d/2 * 20 = 10d/2 = 5d hours. Similarly, he covers the second half of the journey at a speed of 20 km/hr. Therefore, he covers the second half of the distance in d/2 * 20 = 10d/2 = 5d hours. Since the total time taken for the journey is 10 hours, we can write the equation: 5d/20 + 5d/20 = 10 Simplifying this equation, we get: d = 200 km Therefore, the total journey is 200 km. Hence, the correct answer is (E) 200 km. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
