  "test_question": "Q: A rectangle has a length of 8 centimeters and a width of 3 centimeters. Find the perimeter. Answer Choices: (A) 18cm (B) 22cm (C) 20cm (D) 30cm (E) 28cm",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The sides of a rectangular region measured to the nearest centimeter are 8 cm and 5 cm. Out of the following which is the largest possible value of actual area of rectangle ? Answer Choices: (A) 48 (B) 55.25 (C) 52.29 (D) 44 (E) 41.25\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that the actual length and width of the rectangle must be somewhere between 7.5 cm and 8.5 cm for the 8 cm measurement, and between 4.5 cm and 5.5 cm for the 5 cm measurement. To find the largest possible area, we want to use the largest possible length and width within these ranges. The largest possible length is 8.5 cm and the largest possible width is 5.5 cm. So, the largest possible area is 8.5 cm x 5.5 cm = 46.75 cm^2. Out of the given answer choices, the closest one to 46.75 is (D) 44. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 44. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: What is the perimeter, in meters, of a rectangular garden 24 meters wide that has the same area as a rectangular playground 16 meters long and 12 meters wide? Answer Choices: (A) 48 (B) 56 (C) 64 (D) 76 (E) 192\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the area of the playground: Area = length x width = 16 x 12 = 192 square meters Since the garden has the same area, its length must be: Length = Area / width = 192 / 24 = 8 meters Now we can calculate the perimeter of the garden: Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 2(8 + 24) = 2(32) = 64 meters Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 64. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A rectangular of certain dimensions is chopped off from one corner of a larger rectangle as shown. AB = 8 cm and BC = 4 cm. The perimeter of the figure ABCPQRA (in cm) is : Answer Choices: (A) 24 (B) 28 (C) 36 (D) 48 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length of PQ. We can do this by using the Pythagorean theorem since triangle APQ is a right triangle. AP^2 + PQ^2 = AQ^2 We know that AP = AB = 8 cm and AQ = AB + BC = 12 cm. Substituting these values, we get: 8^2 + PQ^2 = 12^2 64 + PQ^2 = 144 PQ^2 = 80 PQ = sqrt(80) = 4sqrt(5) cm Next, we need to find the length of QR. We can do this by using the fact that QR is equal to BC, which is 4 cm. Now we can find the perimeter of the figure by adding up the lengths of all the sides: AB + BC + CP + PQ + QR + RA + AC = 8 + 4 + PQ + 4 + 8 + 4 + 4 = 32 + PQ = 32 + 4sqrt(5) = 28 + 4sqrt(5) Therefore, the answer is (E) None of these, since none of the given options match our answer. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A man cycles round the boundary of a rectangular park at the rate of 12 kmph and completes one full round in 8 minutes. If the ratio between the length and breadth of the park be 3:2, then its area is: Answer Choices: (A) 1536m2 (B) 15360m2 (C) 153600m2 (D) 163600m2 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular park. Let the length and breadth of the park be 3x and 2x respectively (as given in the ratio 3:2). Perimeter of the park = 2(Length + Breadth) = 2(3x + 2x) = 10x Now, we know that the man cycles round the park at the rate of 12 kmph. In 1 hour, he covers a distance of 12 km. In 1 minute, he covers a distance of 12/60 = 0.2 km = 200 m. In 8 minutes, he covers a distance of 200 x 8 = 1600 m = 1.6 km. We also know that in 8 minutes, he completes one full round of the park. Therefore, 10x = 1.6 km x = 160 m Length of the park = 3x = 480 m Breadth of the park = 2x = 320 m Area of the park = Length x Breadth = 480 x 320 = 153600 m\u00b2 Hence, the correct answer is (C) 153600m\u00b2. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
