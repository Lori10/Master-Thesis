  "test_question": "Q: 30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third. What is the value of 50% of that number? Answer Choices: (A) 22.5 (B) 84 (C) 21 (D) 24 (E) 25",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Seventy five percent of a number is 21 less than four fifth of that number. What is the number ? Answer Choices: (A) 240 (B) 340 (C) 420 (D) 130 (E) 125\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the number to be 'x'. According to the problem, 75% of the number is 21 less than 4/5 of the number. Translating this into an equation: 0.75x = (4/5)x - 21 Simplifying this equation: 0.75x - (4/5)x = -21 (15/20)x - (16/20)x = -21 (-1/20)x = -21 x = (-21) * (-20) x = 420 Therefore, the answer is (C) 420. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Which of the following values is the greatest Answer Choices: (A) a)  30% of 89 (B) b)  22% of 78 (C) c)  33% of 67 (D) d)  44% of 56 (E) e)  55% of 45\nA: Let's think step by step. A) 30% of 89 = 0.3 x 89 = 26.7 B) 22% of 78 = 0.22 x 78 = 17.16 C) 33% of 67 = 0.33 x 67 = 22.11 D) 44% of 56 = 0.44 x 56 = 24.64 E) 55% of 45 = 0.55 x 45 = 24.75 Therefore, the greatest value is option (E) 55% of 45. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Dividing by 3\u20446 and then multiplying by 5\u20446 is the same as dividing by what number? Answer Choices: (A) 31\u20445 (B) 16\u20445 (C) 20\u20449 (D) 9\u204420 (E) 5\u20443\nA: Let's think step by step. Dividing by 3/6 is the same as multiplying by 6/3, which simplifies to 2. So, we have: (dividing by 3/6) x (multiplying by 5/6) = (multiplying by 6/3) x (5/6) = 2 x 5/3 = 10/3 Therefore, the answer is (E) 5/3. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: The ratio 5:20 expressed as percent equals to Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 125 % (C) 25 % (D) None of above (E) 30%\nA: Let's think step by step. The ratio 5:20 can be simplified by dividing both numbers by 5. 5:20 = 1:4 Now, we need to convert this ratio to a percentage. To do this, we need to find out what percentage 1 is of 4. 1 is 25% of 4. Therefore, the answer is (C) 25%. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
