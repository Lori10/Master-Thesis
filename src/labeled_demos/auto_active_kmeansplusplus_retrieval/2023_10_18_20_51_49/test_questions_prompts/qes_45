  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Four different books (A, B, C and D) are to be arranged on a shelf. Books A and B are to be arranged first and second starting from the right of the shelf. The number of different orders in which books C and D may be arranged is Answer Choices: (A) 16! (B) 12! (C) 8! (D) 11! (E) 2!\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we arrange books A and B in 2! = 2 ways. Then, we have two remaining books, C and D, which can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways. Therefore, the total number of different orders in which the four books can be arranged is 2 x 2 = 4. None of the above answer choices match this result, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Amanda goes to the toy store to buy 1 ball and 3 different board games. If the toy store is stocked with 3 types of balls and 6 types of board games, how many different selections E of the 4 items can Amanda make? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 12 (C) 14 (D) 15 (E) 60\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Amanda can choose 1 ball out of 3 types of balls. This can be done in 3 ways. Next, she can choose 3 board games out of 6 types of board games. This can be done in 6C3 ways, which is equal to 20. Therefore, the total number of different selections E of the 4 items that Amanda can make is 3 x 20 = 60. So, the correct answer is (E) 60. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A, B can Complete a work in 15 days &10 days respectively. They started doing thework together after 2 days B had to leave and A alone completed the remaining work.The whole work wascompleted in how many days? Answer Choices: (A) 8 days (B) 10 days (C) 12 days (D) 14 days (E) 16 days\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the total work is 150 units (LCM of 15 and 10). In one day, A can complete 10 units of work (150/15) and B can complete 15 units of work (150/10). Together, in one day, they can complete 25 units of work (10+15). After 2 days, the total work completed by A and B together is 50 units (25*2). So, the remaining work is 100 units (150-50). Now, A alone has to complete 100 units of work. In one day, A can complete 10 units of work. Therefore, A will take 10 days to complete the remaining work (100/10). So, the total number of days taken to complete the work is 2+10 = 12 days. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 12 days. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Using all the letters of the word \"NOKIA\", how many words can be formed, which begin with N and end with A? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 24 (C) 62 (D) 78 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to choose the first letter as N, which leaves us with four letters: O, K, I, and A. Next, we need to arrange these four letters in different ways to form words. This can be done in 4! = 24 ways. Finally, we need to ensure that each word ends with A. Out of the four remaining letters, only one is A. Therefore, there is only one way to choose the last letter. So, the total number of words that can be formed is 24 x 1 = 24. Therefore, the answer is (B) 24. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
