  "formatted_prompt": "Q: 8 people decided to split the restaurant bill evenly. If the bill was $214.18 dollars, how much money did they 1 cent is the smallest unit? Answer Choices: (A) $214.16 (B) $214.17 (C) $214.18 (D) $214.19 (E) $214.24\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to divide the total bill by the number of people to find out how much each person should pay. $214.18 \u00f7 8 = $26.7725 Since we cannot have a fraction of a cent, we need to round up to the nearest cent. $26.77 rounds up to $26.78 Therefore, each person should pay $26.78. The closest answer choice is (B) $214.17, but that is not the correct answer. The correct answer is None of the above. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A shopkeeper sells 200 metres of cloth for Rs. 12000 at a loss of Rs.6 per metre. Find his cost price for one metre of cloth? Answer Choices: (A) s.59 (B) s.58 (C) s.09 (D) s.50 (E) s.66\nA: Let's think step by step. The shopkeeper sold 200 meters of cloth for Rs. 12000, which means he sold each meter for Rs. 60 (12000/200). Now, we know that he sold each meter at a loss of Rs. 6. So, his cost price for each meter would be Rs. 66 (60+6). Therefore, the correct answer is (E) Rs. 66. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A salesman\u2019s terms were changed from a flat commission of 5% on all his sales to a fixed salary of Rs.900 plus 2.5% commission on all sales exceeding Rs. 4,000. If his remuneration as per new scheme was Rs. 600 more than that by the previous schema, his sales were worth? Answer Choices: (A) 10000 (B) 12000 (C) 12019 (D) 12197 (E) 12012\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the salesman's sales be x. Under the previous scheme, his commission would be 5% of x, which is 0.05x. Under the new scheme, his commission on sales exceeding Rs. 4,000 would be 2.5% of (x-4000), which is 0.025(x-4000). In addition, he has a fixed salary of Rs. 900. So his remuneration under the new scheme would be: 0.025(x-4000) + 900 And we know that this is Rs. 600 more than his remuneration under the previous scheme, which was 0.05x. So we can set up an equation: 0.025(x-4000) + 900 = 0.05x + 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.025x - 100 + 900 = 0.05x + 600 0.025x + 800 = 0.05x + 600 0.025x = 200 x = 8000 Therefore, his sales were worth Rs. 8,000. None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Mohit sold an article for Rs. 18000. Had he offered a discount of 10% on the selling price, he would have earned a profit of 8%. What is the cost price of the article? Answer Choices: (A) 15000 (B) 15002 (C) 26879 (D) 26992 (E) 12681\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the cost price of the article be x. If Mohit had offered a discount of 10%, the selling price would have been 90% of the original selling price, which is 0.9 * 18000 = 16200. If he had earned a profit of 8%, the cost price would have been (16200/1.08) = 15000. Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 15000. The correct answer is (A) 15000. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
