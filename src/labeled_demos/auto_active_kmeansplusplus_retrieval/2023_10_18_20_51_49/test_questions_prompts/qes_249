  "test_question": "Q: An electric pole, 14 metres high, casts a shadow of 10 metres. Find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions. Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 22 (C) 20 (D) 23 (E) 24",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A rectangular plot measuring 90 metres by 50 metres is to be enclosed by wire fencing. If the poles of the fence are kept 5 metres apart, how many poles will be needed ? Answer Choices: (A) 55 (B) 56 (C) 57 (D) 58 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular plot. Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 2(90 + 50) = 280 meters Next, we need to find the number of poles required if they are kept 5 meters apart. We can divide the perimeter by the distance between two poles: Number of poles = Perimeter / Distance between two poles Number of poles = 280 / 5 = 56 Therefore, the answer is (B) 56. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: An object thrown directly upward is at a height of h feet after t seconds, where h = -15 (t-2)^2 + 150. At what height, in feet, is the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 90 (C) 124 (D) 132 (E) 140\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the maximum height of the object. We can do this by finding the vertex of the quadratic equation h = -15(t-2)^2 + 150. The vertex of a quadratic equation in the form of h = a(t-b)^2 + c is (b, c). In this case, the vertex is (2, 150). This means that the object reaches its maximum height of 150 feet after 2 seconds. Next, we need to find the height of the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height. We can do this by plugging in t = 4 (2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height) into the equation h = -15(t-2)^2 + 150. h = -15(4-2)^2 + 150 h = -15(2)^2 + 150 h = -60 + 150 h = 90 Therefore, the height of the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height is 90 feet. The correct answer is (B) 90. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A train running at the speed of 60 km/hr crosses a pole in 15 seconds. What is the length of the train? Answer Choices: (A) 187 m (B) 250 m (C) 876 m (D) 150 m (E) 267 m\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that the train crosses a pole in 15 seconds. This means that the length of the train plus the length of the front and back gaps (if any) is equal to the distance covered by the train in 15 seconds. We need to convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s, as the time given is in seconds and the answer choices are in meters. 60 km/hr = (60 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 16.67 m/s Let's assume that there are no front or back gaps. Distance covered by the train in 15 seconds = speed x time = 16.67 x 15 = 250.05 meters Therefore, the length of the train is 250 meters. The correct answer is (B) 250 m. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A train running at the speed of 60 km/hr crosses a pole in 6 seconds. What is the length of the train? Answer Choices: (A) 120 metres (B) 180 metres (C) 324 metres (D) 100 metres (E) 180 metres\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that the train crosses a pole in 6 seconds. This means that the length of the train is equal to the distance it covers in 6 seconds at a speed of 60 km/hr. First, we need to convert the speed from km/hr to m/s. 60 km/hr = (60 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 16.67 m/s (rounded off to two decimal places) Now, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time distance = 16.67 m/s x 6 s = 100.02 meters (rounded off to two decimal places) Therefore, the length of the train is 100 meters. The correct answer is (D) 100 metres. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
