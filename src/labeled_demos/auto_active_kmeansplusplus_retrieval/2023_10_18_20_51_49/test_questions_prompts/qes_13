  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A and B invests Rs.2500 and Rs.4000 respectively in a business. If A doubles his capital after 6 months. In what ratio should A and B divide that year's profit? Answer Choices: (A) 11:5 (B) 15:16 (C) 15:2 (D) 9:9 (E) 11:1\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total investment made by A and B. Total investment = Rs.2500 + Rs.4000 = Rs.6500 After 6 months, A doubles his capital. So, his new investment becomes Rs.5000. Now, the ratio of their investments is: A:B = Rs.5000 : Rs.4000 = 5:4 Let's assume that the total profit for the year is Rs.X. A's share of profit = (5/9) X B's share of profit = (4/9) X Therefore, the ratio in which they should divide the profit is: A:B = (5/9) X : (4/9) X = 5:4 So, the correct answer is (D) 9:9. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: The average salary/head of all the workers ina workshop is Rs.850, if the average salary/head of 7technician is Rs.1000 and the average salary/head of the rest is Rs.780, the total no. of workers in the work-shop is ? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 23 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the total number of workers in the workshop be x. We know that the average salary/head of all workers is Rs. 850. So, the total salary of all workers = 850x. We also know that the average salary/head of 7 technicians is Rs. 1000. So, the total salary of these 7 technicians = 1000 x 7 = 7000. Now, we can find the total salary of the remaining workers by subtracting the total salary of the technicians from the total salary of all workers: Total salary of remaining workers = 850x - 7000. We also know that the average salary/head of the remaining workers is Rs. 780. So, we can set up an equation: (850x - 7000) / (x - 7) = 780 Solving for x, we get x = 22. Therefore, the total number of workers in the workshop is 22. The answer is (C) 22. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Two employees X and Y are paid a total of Rs. 550 per week by their employer. If X is paid 120 percent of the sum paid to Y, how much is Y paid per week? Answer Choices: (A) Rs.150 (B) Rs.180 (C) Rs.200 (D) Rs.220 (E) Rs.250\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that Y is paid Rs. x per week. According to the problem, X is paid 120% of what Y is paid. So, X is paid 120/100 * x = 1.2x per week. We also know that the total amount paid to X and Y is Rs. 550 per week. So, we can write an equation: x + 1.2x = 550 Simplifying this equation, we get: 2.2x = 550 Dividing both sides by 2.2, we get: x = 250 Therefore, Y is paid Rs. 250 per week. The correct answer is (E) Rs.250. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Kiran has 85 currency notes in all, some of which were of Rs. 100 denomination and the\nremaining of Rs. 50 denomination. The total amount of all these currency notes was Rs.\n5000. How much amount did she have in the denomination of Rs. 50?\nA. B. C. None of these D.\nAnswer: Option B\nExplanation: Answer Choices: (A) 1900 (B) 3500 (C) 4000 (D) 2000 (E) 2500\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the number of Rs. 100 notes be x and the number of Rs. 50 notes be y. We know that x + y = 85 (total number of notes) and 100x + 50y = 5000 (total amount). Simplifying the second equation, we get 2x + y = 100. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get x = 25 and y = 60. Therefore, the amount in the denomination of Rs. 50 is 50 * 60 = 3000. So, the correct answer is option B. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
