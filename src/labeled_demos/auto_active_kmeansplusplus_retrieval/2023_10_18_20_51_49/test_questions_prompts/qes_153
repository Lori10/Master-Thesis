  "formatted_prompt": "Q: It takes 40 identical printing presses 15 hours to print 500,000 papers. How many hours would it take 30 of these printing presses to print 500,000 papers? Answer Choices: (A) 16 (B) 18 (C) 20 (D) 21 (E) 24\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 40 printing presses can print 500,000 papers in 15 hours. So, we can find the rate of printing of each press by dividing the total number of papers by the total number of hours and the number of presses: Rate of each press = 500,000 / (40 x 15) = 833.33 papers per hour Now, we need to find how many hours it would take 30 printing presses to print 500,000 papers at the same rate. Total time = Total number of papers / (Rate of each press x Number of presses) Total time = 500,000 / (833.33 x 30) Total time = 20 hours Therefore, the answer is (C) 20. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Mary charges $8.50 per hour to clean a house. If she works 29 hours, how much\ndoes she earn in one week?

For the two days combined, what percent of the customers ordered the daily special? Answer Choices: (A) 15% (B) 16% (C) 18% (D) 22% (E) 30%\nA: Let's think step by step. On Monday, 30% of 180 customers ordered the daily special, which is: 0.30 x 180 = 54 customers On Tuesday, 10% of 120 customers ordered the daily special, which is: 0.10 x 120 = 12 customers For the two days combined, the total number of customers who ordered the daily special is: 54 + 12 = 66 customers The total number of customers over the two days is: 180 + 120 = 300 customers To find the percentage of customers who ordered the daily special over the two days, we divide the number of customers who ordered the special by the total number of customers and multiply by 100: (66/300) x 100 = 22% Therefore, the answer is (D) 22%. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: 8 people decided to split the restaurant bill evenly. If the bill was $214.18 dollars, how much money did they 1 cent is the smallest unit?
