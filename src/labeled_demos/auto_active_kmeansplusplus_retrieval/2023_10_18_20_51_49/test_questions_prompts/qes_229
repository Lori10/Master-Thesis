  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A drink vendor has 60 liters of Maaza, 144 liters of Pepsi and 368 liters of Sprite. He wants to pack them in cans, so that each can contains the same number of liters of a drink, and doesn't want to mix any two drinks in a can. What is the least number of cans required? Answer Choices: (A) 135 (B) 137 (C) 143 (D) 310 (E) 380\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 60, 144, and 368 to determine the maximum number of liters that can be packed in a can. The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. The prime factorization of 144 is 2^4 * 3^2. The prime factorization of 368 is 2^4 * 23. The GCD of these three numbers is 12 (2^2 * 3). Therefore, each can can contain a maximum of 12 liters of a drink. To find the least number of cans required, we need to divide each quantity by 12 and round up to the nearest integer. 60/12 = 5 144/12 = 12 368/12 = 31 So we need at least 5 cans of Maaza, 12 cans of Pepsi, and 31 cans of Sprite. The total number of cans required is 5 + 12 + 31 = 48. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Jill has 21 gallons of water stored in quart, half-gallon, and one gallon jars. She has equal numbers of each size jar holding the liquid. What is the total number of water filled jars? Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 6 (C) 9 (D) 36 (E) 14\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert all the jars to the same unit, either quarts, half-gallons, or gallons. Let's convert everything to quarts since it's the smallest unit. One gallon is equal to 4 quarts, so Jill has 21 x 4 = 84 quarts of water. Let's say she has x jars of each size. Each quart jar contains 1 quart of water, each half-gallon jar contains 2 quarts of water, and each gallon jar contains 4 quarts of water. So we can set up the equation: 1x + 2x + 4x = 84 7x = 84 x = 12 Therefore, Jill has 12 jars of each size, for a total of 3 x 12 = 36 jars. The answer is (D) 36. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If a tap could fill entire tank in 15 hrs due to leakage, then in how much time\ntank can be emptied by leakage if tap can fill entire tank in 12 hrs without leakage Answer Choices: (A) 12hrs (B) 24hrs (C) 60hrs (D) 48hrs (E) 52hrs\nA: Let's think step by step. The tap can fill the entire tank in 12 hours without leakage. So, in 1 hour, the tap can fill 1/12th of the tank. Now, let's consider the leakage. The tap can fill the entire tank in 15 hours with leakage. So, in 1 hour, the tap can fill 1/15th of the tank. Let's assume that the leakage can empty the tank in x hours. So, in 1 hour, the leakage can empty 1/xth of the tank. Now, let's set up the equation: Rate of tap - Rate of leakage = Combined rate of filling and emptying 1/12 - 1/x = 1/15 Multiplying both sides by 60x, we get: 5x - 60 = 4x x = 60 Therefore, the tank can be emptied by leakage in 60 hours. The correct answer is (C) 60hrs. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Two pipes A and B can fill a cistern in 10 and 15 minutes respectively. Both fill pipes are opened together,but at the end of 3 minutes, \u2018B\u2019 is turned off. How much time will the cistern take to fill ? Answer Choices: (A) 6 min (B) 8 min (C) 10 min (D) 12 min (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the capacity of the cistern is 'x' liters. In one minute, pipe A can fill 1/10th of the cistern, and pipe B can fill 1/15th of the cistern. When both pipes are opened together, they can fill 1/10 + 1/15 = 1/6th of the cistern in one minute. After 3 minutes, the cistern would have been filled with 3/6th or 1/2 of its capacity. Now, only pipe A is filling the remaining 1/2 of the cistern. In one minute, pipe A can fill 1/10th of the cistern. Therefore, the time taken to fill the remaining 1/2 of the cistern by pipe A alone would be 1/2 \u00f7 1/10 = 5 minutes. Therefore, the total time taken to fill the cistern would be 3 + 5 = 8 minutes. Hence, the correct answer is option (B) 8 min. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
