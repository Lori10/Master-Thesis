  "test_question": "Q: Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads? Answer Choices: (A) 12/25 (B) 3/2 (C) 3 (D) 2 (E) 25/3",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A certain restaurant offers 7 kinds of cheese and 2 kinds of fruit for its dessert platter. If each dessert platter contains an equal number of kinds of cheese and kinds of fruit, how many different dessert platters could the restaurant offer? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 12 (C) 15 (D) 21 (E) 35\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 7 kinds of cheese and 2 kinds of fruit. To have an equal number of kinds of cheese and fruit, we need to find the common factors of 7 and 2. The only common factor is 1. Therefore, each dessert platter can have only 1 kind of cheese and 1 kind of fruit. To find the total number of different dessert platters, we need to multiply the number of options for cheese and fruit. There are 7 options for cheese and 2 options for fruit. Therefore, the total number of different dessert platters is 7 x 2 = 14. However, we need to divide this number by 2 because the order of cheese and fruit does not matter. Therefore, the final answer is 14/2 = 7. So, the correct answer is (A) 8. None of the given options match the correct answer. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Elena\u2019s bread recipe calls for 2 ounces of butter for each 5 cups of flour used. She needs to make 4 times the original recipe. If 12 ounces of butter is used, then how many cups of flour are needed? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 4 (C) 9 (D) 13 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much butter is needed for the new recipe. Since Elena needs to make 4 times the original recipe, she will need 4 x 2 = 8 ounces of butter. Next, we can set up a proportion to find out how much flour is needed. We know that for every 2 ounces of butter, 5 cups of flour are used. So, we can write: 2/5 = 8/x where x is the number of cups of flour needed for the new recipe. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 2x = 40 x = 20 Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: When tossed, a certain six-sided die has an equal probability of landing on any of the six sides. If the die is tossed 3 times, what is the probability that it will land on the same side each time? Answer Choices: (A) 1/6 (B) 1/12 (C) 1/36 (D) 1/72 (E) 1/216\nA: Let's think step by step. The probability of the die landing on the same side each time is the product of the probabilities of it landing on that side each time. Since there are 6 sides, the probability of it landing on a specific side on any given toss is 1/6. Therefore, the probability of it landing on the same side all 3 times is (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) = 1/216. So the correct answer is (E) 1/216. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: If you roll one fair six-sided die, what is the probability that the number is even or less than 4? Answer Choices: (A) 1/6 (B) 1/3 (C) 2/ 3 (D) 3/4 (E) 5/6\nA: Let's think step by step. There are three even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. There are also two odd numbers less than 4: 1 and 3. So, there are a total of 5 outcomes that satisfy the condition of being even or less than 4. The probability of rolling one of these outcomes is therefore 5/6. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 5/6. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
