  "test_question": "Q: If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent? Answer Choices: (A) 30% (B) 40% (C) 20% (D) 10% (E) 5%",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The ratio 5:20 expressed as percent equals to Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 125 % (C) 25 % (D) None of above (E) 30%\nA: Let's think step by step. The ratio 5:20 can be simplified by dividing both numbers by 5. 5:20 = 1:4 Now, we need to convert this ratio to a percentage. To do this, we need to find out what percentage 1 is of 4. 1 is 25% of 4. Therefore, the answer is (C) 25%. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Find 96 \u00d7\u00d7 97 Answer Choices: (A) 91/198 (B) 91/12 (C) 91/13 (D) 91/10 (E) 91/11\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the shortcut method of multiplying numbers that are close to 100. Step 1: Subtract both numbers from 100. 100 - 96 = 4 100 - 97 = 3 Step 2: Add the two differences together. 4 + 3 = 7 Step 3: Subtract the sum from 100. 100 - 7 = 93 Therefore, 96 \u00d7 97 = 9,312 None of the above options are correct. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The output of a factory was increased by 10% to keep up with rising demand. To handle the holiday rush, this new output was increased by 25%. By approximately what percent would the output now have to be decreased in order to restore the original output? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 24% (C) 30% (D) 27% (E) 79%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the original output was 100 units. After the first increase of 10%, the new output became 110 units. After the second increase of 25%, the new output became 137.5 units (110 + 0.25*110). To restore the original output of 100 units, we need to decrease the current output of 137.5 units by a certain percentage. The percentage decrease can be calculated as follows: Percentage decrease = ((New value - Original value) / New value) * 100 = ((137.5 - 100) / 137.5) * 100 = 27.27% Therefore, the output now has to be decreased by approximately 27% to restore the original output. The closest answer choice is (D) 27%. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: The salary of a person was reduced by 20%. By what percent should his reduced salary be raised so as to bring it at par with his original salary? Answer Choices: (A) 50% (B) 32% (C) 25% (D) 43% (E) 29%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the original salary was $100. After a 20% reduction, the new salary becomes $80. Now, we need to find out what percentage increase is needed to bring the reduced salary of $80 back up to the original salary of $100. Let x be the percentage increase needed. We can set up the following equation: $80 + (x/100) * $80 = $100 Simplifying this equation: $80 + 0.8x = $100 0.8x = $20 x = 25 Therefore, the reduced salary needs to be raised by 25% to bring it back up to the original salary. The answer is (C) 25%. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
