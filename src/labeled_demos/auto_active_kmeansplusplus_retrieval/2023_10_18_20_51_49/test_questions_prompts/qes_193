  "test_question": "Q: A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper? Answer Choices: (A) 8.75 (B) 8.79 (C) 8.75 (D) 8.71 (E) 8.72",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A 25 cm wide path is to be made around a circular garden having a diameter of 4 meters. Approximate area of the path is square meters is? Answer Choices: (A) 3.34 sq m (B) 2.98 sq m (C) 9.98 sq m (D) 1.98 sq m (E) 3.78 sq m\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the radius of the circular garden. We know that the diameter is 4 meters, so the radius is half of that, which is 2 meters. Next, we need to find the radius of the garden plus the width of the path. The width of the path is given as 25 cm, which is 0.25 meters. So, the radius of the garden plus the width of the path is 2 + 0.25 = 2.25 meters. Now, we can find the area of the path by subtracting the area of the garden from the area of the larger circle with radius 2.25 meters. The area of the garden is \u03c0r^2 = \u03c0(2)^2 = 4\u03c0 square meters. The area of the larger circle is \u03c0(2.25)^2 = 5.06\u03c0 square meters. So, the area of the path is 5.06\u03c0 - 4\u03c0 = 1.06\u03c0 square meters. Finally, we can approximate this value using 3.14 as an approximation for \u03c0. So, the area of the path is approximately 1.06 x 3.14 = 3.3244 square meters, which is closest to answer choice (A) 3.34 sq m. Therefore, the answer is (A) 3.34 sq m. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A wire in the form of a circle of radius 3.5 m is bent in the form of a rectangule, whose length and breadth are in the ratio of 6 : 5. What is the area of the rectangle? Answer Choices: (A) 70 cm2 (B) 30 cm2 (C) 66 cm2 (D) 55 cm2 (E) 54 cm2\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length and breadth of the rectangle. Let the length be 6x and the breadth be 5x. The perimeter of the circle is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle. Perimeter of circle = 2\u03c0r = 2\u03c0(3.5) = 7\u03c0 Perimeter of rectangle = 2(6x + 5x) = 22x So, 22x = 7\u03c0 x = 7\u03c0/22 Now, length = 6x = 6(7\u03c0/22) = 21\u03c0/11 Breadth = 5x = 5(7\u03c0/22) = 35\u03c0/22 Area of rectangle = length x breadth = (21\u03c0/11) x (35\u03c0/22) = 735\u03c0^2/242 This is approximately equal to 76.2 m^2. None of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: The sides of a rectangular region measured to the nearest centimeter are 8 cm and 5 cm. Out of the following which is the largest possible value of actual area of rectangle ? Answer Choices: (A) 48 (B) 55.25 (C) 52.29 (D) 44 (E) 41.25\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that the actual length and width of the rectangle must be somewhere between 7.5 cm and 8.5 cm for the 8 cm measurement, and between 4.5 cm and 5.5 cm for the 5 cm measurement. To find the largest possible area, we want to use the largest possible length and width within these ranges. The largest possible length is 8.5 cm and the largest possible width is 5.5 cm. So, the largest possible area is 8.5 cm x 5.5 cm = 46.75 cm^2. Out of the given answer choices, the closest one to 46.75 is (D) 44. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 44. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A rectangular of certain dimensions is chopped off from one corner of a larger rectangle as shown. AB = 8 cm and BC = 4 cm. The perimeter of the figure ABCPQRA (in cm) is : Answer Choices: (A) 24 (B) 28 (C) 36 (D) 48 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length of PQ. We can do this by using the Pythagorean theorem since triangle APQ is a right triangle. AP^2 + PQ^2 = AQ^2 We know that AP = AB = 8 cm and AQ = AB + BC = 12 cm. Substituting these values, we get: 8^2 + PQ^2 = 12^2 64 + PQ^2 = 144 PQ^2 = 80 PQ = sqrt(80) = 4sqrt(5) cm Next, we need to find the length of QR. We can do this by using the fact that QR is equal to BC, which is 4 cm. Now we can find the perimeter of the figure by adding up the lengths of all the sides: AB + BC + CP + PQ + QR + RA + AC = 8 + 4 + PQ + 4 + 8 + 4 + 4 = 32 + PQ = 32 + 4sqrt(5) = 28 + 4sqrt(5) Therefore, the answer is (E) None of these, since none of the given options match our answer. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
