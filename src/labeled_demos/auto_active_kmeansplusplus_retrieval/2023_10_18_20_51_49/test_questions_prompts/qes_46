  "test_question": "Q: A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 240 (C) 30 (D) 60 (E) 120",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: What is the time required for a bike to cover a distance of 450 km with a speed of 90 kmh? Answer Choices: (A) 5 hours (B) 3 hours (C) 8 hours (D) 6 hours (E) 4 hours\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed Plugging in the given values, we get: time = 450 km / 90 km/h Simplifying, we get: time = 5 hours Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 5 hours. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The speed of a train is 94 kmph. What is the distance covered by it in 12 minutes? Answer Choices: (A) 15 kmph (B) 11 kmph (C) 88 kmph (D) 19 kmph (E) 12 kmph\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that the speed of the train is 94 kmph. To find the distance covered in 12 minutes, we need to convert 12 minutes to hours. 1 hour = 60 minutes So, 12 minutes = 12/60 = 0.2 hours Now, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time Distance = 94 kmph x 0.2 hours Distance = 18.8 km Therefore, the distance covered by the train in 12 minutes is 18.8 km. The answer is not listed in the options. None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A person crosses a 600 m long street in 2 minutes. What is his speed in km per hour? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 24 (C) 18 (D) 42 (E) 64\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the distance from meters to kilometers. We can do this by dividing 600 by 1000, which gives us 0.6 km. Next, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. We can do this by dividing 2 by 60, which gives us 0.0333 hours (rounded to four decimal places). Finally, we can calculate the speed by dividing the distance by the time. So, speed = distance/time = 0.6/0.0333 = 18 (rounded to the nearest whole number). Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 18. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: James took a 3-hour bike ride. In the second hour he travlled 18 miles, which was 20 percent farther than he traveled the first hour. If he traveled 25 percent farther in the third hour than he did in the second hour, how many miles did jose travel during the entire ride? Answer Choices: (A) 54.0 (B) 54.9 (C) 55.5 (D) 57.0 (E) 63.0\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how far James traveled in the first hour. We know that in the second hour he traveled 20% farther than in the first hour, so we can set up the equation: 18 = 1.2x where x is the distance James traveled in the first hour. Solving for x, we get: x = 15 Next, we need to find out how far James traveled in the third hour. We know that in the third hour he traveled 25% farther than in the second hour, so we can set up the equation: d = 1.25(18) where d is the distance James traveled in the third hour. Solving for d, we get: d = 22.5 Finally, we can add up the distances traveled in each hour to find the total distance traveled: total distance = 15 + 18 + 22.5 = 55.5 Therefore, the answer is (C) 55.5. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
