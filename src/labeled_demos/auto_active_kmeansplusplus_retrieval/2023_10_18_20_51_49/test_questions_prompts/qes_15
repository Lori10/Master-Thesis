  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If on an item a company gives 25% discount, they earn 25% profit.If they now give 10% discount then what is the profit? Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 40 (C) 50 (D) 60 (E) 70\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the original price of the item is $100. With a 25% discount, the selling price becomes 75% of the original price, which is $75. Now, we know that the company earns a 25% profit on this selling price of $75. Profit = 25% of $75 = $18.75 So, the cost price of the item for the company is $75 - $18.75 = $56.25 If the company now gives a 10% discount, the selling price becomes 90% of $75, which is $67.50. The cost price for the company remains the same at $56.25. Profit = Selling price - Cost price = $67.50 - $56.25 = $11.25 Therefore, the profit is $11.25. The correct answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the calculated profit. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Mohit sold an article for Rs. 18000.

Answer Choices: (A) 15000 (B) 15002 (C) 26879 (D) 26992 (E) 12681\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the cost price of the article be x. If Mohit had offered a discount of 10%, the selling price would have been 90% of the original selling price, which is 0.9 * 18000 = 16200. If he had earned a profit of 8%, the cost price would have been (16200/1.08) = 15000. Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 15000. The correct answer is (A) 15000. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A shopkeeper marks up the price of his goods by 20% and gives a discount of 10% to the customer. He also uses a 900g weight instead of 1Kg weight. Find his profit percentage. Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 12% (C) 20% (D) 30% (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume the cost price of the goods is $100. The shopkeeper marks up the price by 20%, so the selling price becomes $120. Next, the shopkeeper gives a discount of 10%, so the selling price becomes $108. Now, the shopkeeper uses a 900g weight instead of 1Kg weight. This means that the customer is paying for 100g less than what they think they are paying for. To calculate the profit percentage, we need to find the profit made by the shopkeeper. Profit = Selling price - Cost price Cost price = $100 (as assumed earlier) Selling price = $108 Profit = $108 - $100 = $8 Now, we need to calculate the profit percentage. Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost price) x 100 Profit percentage = (8 / 100) x 100 = 8% Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 8%. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A shopkeeper sells 200 metres of cloth for Rs. 12000 at a loss of Rs.6 per metre. Find his cost price for one metre of cloth? Answer Choices: (A) s.59 (B) s.58 (C) s.09 (D) s.50 (E) s.66\nA: Let's think step by step. The shopkeeper sold 200 meters of cloth for Rs. 12000, which means he sold each meter for Rs. 60 (12000/200). Now, we know that he sold each meter at a loss of Rs. 6. So, his cost price for each meter would be Rs. 66 (60+6). Therefore, the correct answer is (E) Rs. 66. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
