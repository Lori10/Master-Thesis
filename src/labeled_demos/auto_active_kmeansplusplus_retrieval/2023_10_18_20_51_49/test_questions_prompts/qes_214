  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 99 (C) 88 (D) 77 (E) 23\nA: Let's think step by step. Let Q's age be x. Then, R's age will be (x + y) and T's age will be (x - y), where y is the age difference between Q and T. Given, (x + y) + (x - y) = 50 2x = 50 x = 25 Therefore, Q's age is 25. Also, R's age is (25 + y). Given, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, (25 + y) - 25 = 25 - (25 - y) y = 12.5 Therefore, R's age is (25 + 12.5) = 37.5 The difference between R and Q's age is (37.5 - 25) = 12.5 Hence, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A father was as old as his son's present at the time of your birth. If the father's age is 38 years now, the son's age 5years back was? Answer Choices: (A) 10 years (B) 12 years (C) 14 years (D) 16 years (E) 18 years\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the son's present age be x. According to the problem, the father's age at the time of the son's birth was x. Now, the father's present age is 38. So, the age difference between the father and son is 38 - x. We need to find the son's age 5 years back, which means we need to subtract 5 from x. So, (38 - x) = x - 5 Solving this equation, we get x = 14 Therefore, the son's age 5 years back was 14 - 5 = 9 The correct answer is not given in the options. None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A father said to his son, \"I was as old as you are at the present at the time of your birth\". If the father's age is 38 years now, the son's age five years back was: Answer Choices: (A) 24 years (B) 33 years (C) 14 years (D) 18 years (E) 9 years\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the son's current age be x. According to the problem, the father's age at the time of the son's birth was x. Therefore, the father's current age is x + 38 (since the son's current age is x). We need to find the son's age 5 years back, which would be x - 5. Now, we can set up an equation: x - 5 = 38 - x Solving for x, we get: 2x = 43 x = 21.5 Therefore, the son's age 5 years back was: 21.5 - 5 = 16.5 None of the answer choices match this result, so the answer is: None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Rose is two years older than Bruce who is twice as old as Chris. If the total of the age of Rose, B and Chris be 47 years, then how old is Bruce ? Answer Choices: (A) 18 years (B) 10 years (C) 12 years (D) 13 years (E) 14 years\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's start by assigning variables to the ages of Bruce and Chris. Let's say Bruce's age is B and Chris's age is C. According to the problem, Rose is two years older than Bruce, so her age can be represented as B + 2. We also know that Bruce is twice as old as Chris, so we can write: B = 2C Now we can substitute B = 2C into the equation for the total of their ages: (B + 2) + B + C = 47 Simplifying this equation: 2B + C = 45 Substituting B = 2C: 4C + C = 45 5C = 45 C = 9 Now we can find Bruce's age: B = 2C = 2(9) = 18 So the answer is (A) 18 years. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
