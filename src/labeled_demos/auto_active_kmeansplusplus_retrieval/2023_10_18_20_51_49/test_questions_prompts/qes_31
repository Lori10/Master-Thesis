  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A shopkeeper marks up the price of his goods by 20% and gives a discount of 10% to the customer. He also uses a 900g weight instead of 1Kg weight. Find his profit percentage. Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 12% (C) 20% (D) 30% (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume the cost price of the goods is $100. The shopkeeper marks up the price by 20%, so the selling price becomes $120. Next, the shopkeeper gives a discount of 10%, so the selling price becomes $108. Now, the shopkeeper uses a 900g weight instead of 1Kg weight. This means that the customer is paying for 100g less than what they think they are paying for. To calculate the profit percentage, we need to find the profit made by the shopkeeper. Profit = Selling price - Cost price Cost price = $100 (as assumed earlier) Selling price = $108 Profit = $108 - $100 = $8 Now, we need to calculate the profit percentage. Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost price) x 100 Profit percentage = (8 / 100) x 100 = 8% Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 8%. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The Shopkeeper increased the price of a product by 25% so that customer finds it difficult to purchase the required amount. But somehow the customer managed to purchase only 70% of the required amount. What is the net difference in the expenditure on that product? Answer Choices: (A) 12.5% (B) 13% (C) 15% (D) 17% (E) 19%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the original price of the product was $100. After increasing the price by 25%, the new price becomes $125. Now, the customer only purchases 70% of the required amount. This means the customer only spends 70% of the amount they would have spent if they had purchased the required amount. So, the customer spends 70% of $125, which is $87.50. The net difference in expenditure can be calculated by finding the percentage decrease in expenditure. The original expenditure would have been 100% of $125, which is $125. The actual expenditure is $87.50. So, the percentage decrease in expenditure is: ((125 - 87.5)/125) x 100% = 30/125 x 100% = 24% Therefore, the net difference in expenditure is 24%. None of the answer choices match the calculated answer, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: If on an item a company gives 25% discount, they earn 25% profit.If they now give 10% discount then what is the profit? Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 40 (C) 50 (D) 60 (E) 70\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the original price of the item is $100. With a 25% discount, the selling price becomes 75% of the original price, which is $75. Now, we know that the company earns a 25% profit on this selling price of $75. Profit = 25% of $75 = $18.75 So, the cost price of the item for the company is $75 - $18.75 = $56.25 If the company now gives a 10% discount, the selling price becomes 90% of $75, which is $67.50. The cost price for the company remains the same at $56.25. Profit = Selling price - Cost price = $67.50 - $56.25 = $11.25 Therefore, the profit is $11.25. The correct answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the calculated profit. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A trader bought a car at 20% discount on its original price. He sold it at a 40% increase on the price he bought it. What percent of profit did he make on the original price? Answer Choices: (A) 17% (B) 17% (C) 12% (D) 82% (E) 92%\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. Let's assume that the original price of the car was $100. The trader bought the car at a 20% discount, which means he paid 80% of the original price, i.e., $80. He then sold the car at a 40% increase on the price he bought it, which means he sold it for 140% of the price he bought it, i.e., $112. Now, let's calculate the profit he made on the original price. Profit = Selling price - Cost price Profit = $112 - $100 Profit = $12 Therefore, the profit he made on the original price was $12. To calculate the percentage profit, we need to divide the profit by the original price and multiply by 100. Percentage profit = (Profit / Original price) x 100 Percentage profit = ($12 / $100) x 100 Percentage profit = 12% Therefore, the trader made a profit of 12% on the original price. Hence, the correct answer is option (C) 12%. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
