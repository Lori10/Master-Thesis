  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Two stations A and B are 110 km apart on a straight line. One train starts from A at 7 a.m. and travels towards B at 20 kmph. Another train starts from B at 8 a.m. and travels towards A at a speed of 25 kmph. At what time will they meet? Answer Choices: (A) 39 (B) 10 (C) 88 (D) 12 (E) 18\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much distance the first train covers before the second train starts. The first train starts at 7 a.m. and the second train starts at 8 a.m., which means the first train has a one-hour head start. In one hour, the first train covers a distance of 20 km. Now, let's assume that the two trains meet after t hours. In that case, the second train would have traveled for t - 1 hours. Let's use the formula: distance = speed x time Distance covered by the first train + Distance covered by the second train = Total distance between the two stations 20t + 25(t-1) = 110 Simplifying the equation, we get: 45t = 135 t = 3 Therefore, the two trains will meet after 3 hours. The first train started at 7 a.m., so it will meet the second train at 10 a.m. Hence, the correct answer is (B) 10. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Train A and Train B began traveling towards each other from opposite ends of a 480-mile long track at 1:00 PM. If Train A traveled at 35 miles per hour and Train B traveled at 25 miles per hour, at what time did the trains meet? Answer Choices: (A) 5:40 PM (B) 6:00 PM (C) 7:20 PM (D) 9:00 PM (E) 9:20 PM\nA: Let's think step by step. We can start by using the formula: distance = rate x time. Let's call the time it takes for the trains to meet \"t\". Train A travels at 35 miles per hour, so in time \"t\", it will travel a distance of 35t. Train B travels at 25 miles per hour, so in time \"t\", it will travel a distance of 25t. Since the trains are traveling towards each other, the total distance they will cover is 480 miles. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 35t + 25t = 480 Simplifying: 60t = 480 t = 8 So the trains will meet 8 hours after they started, which would be at 9:00 PM. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 9:00 PM. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Two trains each 250 m in length are running on the same parallel lines in opposite directions with the speed of 80 kmph and 70 kmph respectively. In what time will they cross each other completely? Answer Choices: (A) 19 sec (B) 22 sec (C) 12 sec (D) 42 sec (E) 32 sec\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speeds from kmph to m/s. Speed of first train = 80 kmph = (80 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 22.22 m/s Speed of second train = 70 kmph = (70 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 19.44 m/s Now, we need to find the relative speed of the two trains. Relative speed = (Speed of first train + Speed of second train) = (22.22 + 19.44) m/s = 41.66 m/s The total distance to be covered by the two trains to cross each other completely is the sum of their lengths, which is 250 + 250 = 500 m. Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed Time = 500 / 41.66 Time = 12 sec Therefore, the answer is (C) 12 sec. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A man sitting in a train which is traveling at 50 kmph observes that a goods train, traveling in opposite direction, takes 9 seconds to pass him. If the goods train is 280 m long, find its speed Answer Choices: (A) 52 kmph (B) 56 kmph (C) 58 kmph (D) 62 kmph (E) 72 kmph\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the train from kmph to m/s, since the length of the goods train is given in meters. 50 kmph = (50 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 13.89 m/s Next, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time to find the speed of the goods train. We know the distance (280 m) and the time it takes to pass the man (9 seconds). speed = 280 / 9 = 31.11 m/s Finally, we convert the speed of the goods train from m/s to kmph: 31.11 m/s = (31.11 x 60 x 60) / 1000 kmph = 111.96 kmph Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The correct answer is: None of the above. The answer is No answer.\n\n\n"
