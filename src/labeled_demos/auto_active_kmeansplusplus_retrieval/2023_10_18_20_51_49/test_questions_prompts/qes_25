  "formatted_prompt": "Q: There are two numbers. If 20% of the first number is added to the second number, then the second number increases to its five-fourth. Find the ratio of the first number to the second number? Answer Choices: (A) A) 5/4 (B) B) 5/8 (C) C) 6 (D) D) 6/7 (E) E) 7\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the first number be x and the second number be y. According to the problem, we know that: y + 0.2x = (5/4)y Simplifying this equation: 0.2x = (1/4)y x/y = (1/4)/(1/5) x/y = 5/4 Therefore, the answer is (A) 5/4. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: There are two numbers. If 45% of the first number is added to the second number, then the second number increases to its five-fourth. Find the ratio of the first number to the second number? Answer Choices: (A) A) 3/7 (B) B) 5/9 (C) C) 6 (D) D) 6/7 (E) E) 7\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the first number be x and the second number be y. According to the problem, we know that: y + 0.45x = (5/4)y Simplifying this equation: 0.45x = (1/4)y Multiplying both sides by 4: 1.8x = y Now we need to find the ratio of x to y: x/y = x/(1.8x) = 1/1.8 = 10/18 = 5/9 Therefore, the answer is (B) 5/9. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: The difference between a positive proper fraction and its reciprocal is 9/20. The fraction is? Answer Choices: (A) 4/5 (B) 4/7 (C) 5 (D) 5/7 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the fraction be x/y. According to the problem, x/y - y/x = 9/20 Multiplying both sides by xy, we get x^2 - y^2 = 9xy/20 Simplifying, 20x^2 - 20y^2 = 9xy 20x^2 - 9xy - 20y^2 = 0 We can factor this as (4x - 5y)(5x + 4y) = 0 So either 4x - 5y = 0 or 5x + 4y = 0. If 4x - 5y = 0, then x/y = 5/4. If 5x + 4y = 0, then x/y = -4/5, but this is not a positive proper fraction. Therefore, the answer is (A) 4/5. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The ratio between x and y is 7/5; x is multiplied by y and y is multiplied by x , what is the ratio between the new values of x and y? Answer Choices: (A) 7/5 (B) 5/7 (C) 1 (D) 49/25 (E) It Cannot Be Determined\nA: Let's think step by step. The ratio between x and y is 7/5, which means x/y = 7/5 or x = (7/5)y. When x is multiplied by y, we get xy = (7/5)y^2. Similarly, when y is multiplied by x, we get yx = (7/5)xy = (7/5)x^2. Now, we need to find the ratio between the new values of x and y, which are xy and yx, respectively. So, (xy)/(yx) = [(7/5)y^2]/[(7/5)x^2] = (y/x)^2 = (5/7)^2 = 25/49. Therefore, the answer is (D) 49/25. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
