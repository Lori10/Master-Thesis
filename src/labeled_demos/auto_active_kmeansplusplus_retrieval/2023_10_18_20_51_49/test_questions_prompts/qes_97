  "test_question": "Q: A two digit number exceeds the sum of the digits of that number by 18. If the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, what is the number? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 24 (C) 42 (D) 48 (E) 49",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In a two digit number, the digit in the units place is four times the digit in ten's place and sum of the digits is equal to 10. What is the number? Answer Choices: (A) 25 (B) 28 (C) 32 (D) 36 (E) 38\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the digit in the ten's place is x. Then, the digit in the units place is 4x. According to the problem, the sum of the digits is equal to 10. So, we can write an equation: x + 4x = 10 Simplifying the equation: 5x = 10 x = 2 So, the digit in the ten's place is 2 and the digit in the units place is 4x = 4(2) = 8. Therefore, the number is 28. The correct answer is (B) 28. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: One half of a two digit number exceeds its one third by 9. What is the sum of the digits of the number? Answer Choices: (A) A) 3 (B) B) 5 (C) C) 7 (D) D) 9 (E) E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the two-digit number is represented by 'xy', where x is the tens digit and y is the units digit. According to the problem, we can write the following equation: 1/2(xy) - 1/3(xy) = 9 Simplifying this equation, we get: xy/6 = 9 Multiplying both sides by 6, we get: xy = 54 Therefore, the two-digit number is 54. The sum of the digits of the number is 5 + 4 = 9. So, the correct answer is (D) 9. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: How many 4-digit Q numbers (ABCD) can be formed such that |A \u2013 D| = 2? Answer Choices: (A) 2,000 (B) 1,900 (C) 1,800 (D) 1,600 (E) 1,500\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that |A \u2013 D| = 2. This means that A and D are either 2 digits apart or 2 digits away from each other in the number line. Case 1: A is 2 digits greater than D. In this case, we can choose any digit from 1 to 9 for D (since it's a 4-digit number, we can't have 0 as the first digit). Then, A can be any digit that is 2 greater than D, except for 9 (since we can't have a 5th digit). So, there are 8 choices for A. Case 2: D is 2 digits greater than A. This is the same as Case 1, but with A and D switched. So, there are also 8 choices for A in this case. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit Q numbers that can be formed is 8 + 8 = 16. The answer is (D) 1,600. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If you add all the numbers on your mobile phone except 9, what is the answer? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 28 (C) 65 (D) 36 (E) 42\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to identify all the numbers on a mobile phone except 9. These are the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Next, we need to add all these digits together. 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36 Therefore, the answer is (D) 36. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
