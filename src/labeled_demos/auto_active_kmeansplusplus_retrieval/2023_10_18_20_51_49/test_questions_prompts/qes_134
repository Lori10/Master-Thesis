Then it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which Answer Choices: (A) L(x,y)  = R(x,y)  (B) L(x,y)  \u2260 R(x,y)  (C) L(x,y)  < R(x,y)  (D) L(x,y)  < R(x,y)  (E) None",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If (x^2 + 1)y=8, which of the following is not a possible value for y? Answer Choices: (A) 8/2 (B) 2/5 (C) 18/3 (D) 3 (E) 17/2\nA: Let's think step by step. We are given the equation (x^2 + 1)y = 8. To find the possible values of y, we need to solve for y. Dividing both sides by (x^2 + 1), we get: y = 8/(x^2 + 1) So, any value of y that makes the denominator (x^2 + 1) equal to zero is not possible, as division by zero is undefined. The denominator (x^2 + 1) is always positive, so it can never be zero. Therefore, all the given answer choices are possible values of y. Hence, the answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If [M] denotes the least integer greater than or equal to M and [M] = 0, which of the following statements must be true? Answer Choices: (A) M = 0 (B) 0 <= M < 1 (C) -1 < M <= 0 (D) -1 <= M < 0 (E) 0 < M <= 1\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that [M] = 0, which means that M is between 0 and 1, but not equal to 1. Option (A) M = 0 is not necessarily true, as M could be any number between 0 and 1, not just 0. Option (B) 0 <= M < 1 is true, as we know M is between 0 and 1, but not equal to 1. Option (C) -1 < M <= 0 is not necessarily true, as M is greater than or equal to 0. Option (D) -1 <= M < 0 is not necessarily true, as M is greater than or equal to 0. Option (E) 0 < M <= 1 is not necessarily true, as M could be equal to 0. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 0 <= M < 1. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If 100<x<199 and 9<y<100, then the product xy CANNOT be equal to: Answer Choices: (A) 19,104 (B) 19,303 (C) 19,956.732 (D) 19,502 (E) 19,809\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 100 < x < 199 and 9 < y < 100. Therefore, the minimum value of xy occurs when x is at its minimum value of 101 and y is at its minimum value of 10. So, the minimum value of xy is 101 * 10 = 1010. Now, let's check each answer choice to see if it is possible for xy to equal that value: (A) 19,104 = 96 * 199, which is not possible since y must be less than 100. (B) 19,303 = 97 * 199, which is not possible since y must be less than 100. (C) 19,956.732 is not a whole number, so it is not possible. (D) 19,502 = 98 * 199, which is not possible since y must be less than 100. (E) 19,809 = 99 * 201, which is possible since both x and y are within the given ranges. Therefore, the answer is (E) 19,809. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Let f(x,y) be defined as the remainder when (x\u2013y)! is divided by x. If x=16, what is the maximum value of y for which f(x,y)=0? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 10 (C) 15 (D) 20 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the value of (x-y)!. Since x=16, we have (16-y)!. Next, we need to find the remainder when (16-y)! is divided by 16. This means we need to find the largest value of y such that (16-y)! is divisible by 16. We know that 16=2^4, so we need to find the largest power of 2 that divides (16-y)!. We can use the formula for the highest power of a prime p that divides n!, which is given by: \u230an/p\u230b + \u230an/p^2\u230b + \u230an/p^3\u230b + ... where \u230ax\u230b denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. In this case, p=2 and n=16-y, so we have: \u230a(16-y)/2\u230b + \u230a(16-y)/4\u230b + \u230a(16-y)/8\u230b + \u230a(16-y)/16\u230b Simplifying this expression, we get: 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15 So the largest power of 2 that divides (16-y)! is 2^15. Therefore, the maximum value of y for which f(x,y)=0 is 15. The answer is (C) 15. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
