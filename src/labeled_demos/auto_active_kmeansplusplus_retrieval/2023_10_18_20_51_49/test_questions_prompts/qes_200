  "test_question": "Q: A flagstaff 17.5 metre high casts a shadow of length 40.25 metre. The height of building, which casts a shadow of length 28.75 metre under similar conditions will be : Answer Choices: (A) 12 metre (B) 12.5 metre (C) 13.5 metre (D) 14 metre (E) 15 metre",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A rectangular plot measuring 90 metres by 50 metres is to be enclosed by wire fencing. If the poles of the fence are kept 5 metres apart, how many poles will be needed ? Answer Choices: (A) 55 (B) 56 (C) 57 (D) 58 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular plot. Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 2(90 + 50) = 280 meters Next, we need to find the number of poles required if they are kept 5 meters apart. We can divide the perimeter by the distance between two poles: Number of poles = Perimeter / Distance between two poles Number of poles = 280 / 5 = 56 Therefore, the answer is (B) 56. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: What will be the cost of building a fence around a square plot with area equal to 289 sq ft, if the price per foot of building the fence is Rs. 58? Answer Choices: (A) Rs.3944 (B) Rs.3948 (C) Rs.3942 (D) Rs.3965 (E) Rs.3929\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length of one side of the square plot. We know that the area of the square is 289 sq ft, so we can take the square root of 289 to get the length of one side: \u221a289 = 17 Therefore, the length of one side of the square plot is 17 ft. Next, we need to find the perimeter of the square plot, which is the total length of the fence we need to build. Since all sides of a square are equal, we can simply multiply the length of one side by 4: 17 x 4 = 68 So we need to build a fence that is 68 ft long. Finally, we can calculate the cost of building the fence by multiplying the length of the fence by the price per foot: 68 x 58 = 3944 Therefore, the cost of building the fence is Rs. 3944. The correct answer is (A) Rs.3944. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: What is the perimeter, in meters, of a rectangular garden 24 meters wide that has the same area as a rectangular playground 16 meters long and 12 meters wide? Answer Choices: (A) 48 (B) 56 (C) 64 (D) 76 (E) 192\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the area of the playground: Area = length x width = 16 x 12 = 192 square meters Since the garden has the same area, its length must be: Length = Area / width = 192 / 24 = 8 meters Now we can calculate the perimeter of the garden: Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 2(8 + 24) = 2(32) = 64 meters Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 64. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A rectangular of certain dimensions is chopped off from one corner of a larger rectangle as shown. AB = 8 cm and BC = 4 cm. The perimeter of the figure ABCPQRA (in cm) is : Answer Choices: (A) 24 (B) 28 (C) 36 (D) 48 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length of PQ. We can do this by using the Pythagorean theorem since triangle APQ is a right triangle. AP^2 + PQ^2 = AQ^2 We know that AP = AB = 8 cm and AQ = AB + BC = 12 cm. Substituting these values, we get: 8^2 + PQ^2 = 12^2 64 + PQ^2 = 144 PQ^2 = 80 PQ = sqrt(80) = 4sqrt(5) cm Next, we need to find the length of QR. We can do this by using the fact that QR is equal to BC, which is 4 cm. Now we can find the perimeter of the figure by adding up the lengths of all the sides: AB + BC + CP + PQ + QR + RA + AC = 8 + 4 + PQ + 4 + 8 + 4 + 4 = 32 + PQ = 32 + 4sqrt(5) = 28 + 4sqrt(5) Therefore, the answer is (E) None of these, since none of the given options match our answer. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
