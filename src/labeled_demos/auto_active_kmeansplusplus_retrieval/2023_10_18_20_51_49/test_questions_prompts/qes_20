  "test_question": "Q: A bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers it flies by because it can sense they don't have any nectar in them. How many flowers will the bee fly by to bypass 8 flowers? Answer Choices: (A) 2000 (B) 4000 (C) 8000 (D) 16000 (E) 32000",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Look at this series: 1000, 200, 40, ... What number should come next? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 10 (C) 15 (D) 20 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. The pattern seems to be that each number is divided by 5 to get the next number in the series. 1000 \u00f7 5 = 200 200 \u00f7 5 = 40 So, the next number in the series should be: 40 \u00f7 5 = 8 Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 8. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: How many numbers from 2 to 8 are exactly divisible by 2? Answer Choices: (A) A) 2 (B) B) 4 (C) C) 5 (D) D) 7 (E) E) 8\nA: Let's think step by step. We need to find the numbers from 2 to 8 that are exactly divisible by 2. Divisible by 2 means that the number can be divided by 2 without leaving any remainder. The numbers from 2 to 8 are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Out of these, the numbers that are exactly divisible by 2 are: 2, 4, 6, 8. So, the answer is (B) 4. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: When 1/10 percent of 2,000 is subtracted from 1/10 of 2,000, the difference is Answer Choices: (A)  0 (B)  198 (C)  450 (D)  495 (E)  500\nA: Let's think step by step. 1/10 percent of 2,000 is equal to (1/10)*(1/100)*2,000 = 2. 1/10 of 2,000 is equal to 200. So, when we subtract 2 from 200, we get 198. Therefore, the answer is (B) 198. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: How many 4-digit Q numbers (ABCD) can be formed such that |A \u2013 D| = 2? Answer Choices: (A) 2,000 (B) 1,900 (C) 1,800 (D) 1,600 (E) 1,500\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that |A \u2013 D| = 2. This means that A and D are either 2 digits apart or 2 digits away from each other in the number line. Case 1: A is 2 digits greater than D. In this case, we can choose any digit from 1 to 9 for D (since it's a 4-digit number, we can't have 0 as the first digit). Then, A can be any digit that is 2 greater than D, except for 9 (since we can't have a 5th digit). So, there are 8 choices for A. Case 2: D is 2 digits greater than A. This is the same as Case 1, but with A and D switched. So, there are also 8 choices for A in this case. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit Q numbers that can be formed is 8 + 8 = 16. The answer is (D) 1,600. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
