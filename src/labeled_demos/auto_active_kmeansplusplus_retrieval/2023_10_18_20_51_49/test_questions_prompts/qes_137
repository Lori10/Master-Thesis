  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The value of (0.2\u00d70.2+0.01) (0.1\u00d70.1+0.02)-1 is equal to Answer Choices: (A) 5/3 (B) 9/5 (C) 41/4 (D) 41/12 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can simplify the expression inside the parentheses: (0.2\u00d70.2+0.01) = 0.041 (0.1\u00d70.1+0.02) = 0.012 So now we have: 0.041 \u00d7 0.012 - 1 Simplifying further: 0.000492 - 1 -0.999508 None of the answer choices match this result, so the answer is: (E) None The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: 1/0.025 is equal to Answer Choices: (A) 25.5 (B) 2.5 (C) 40 (D) .25 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. We can simplify 1/0.025 by dividing 1 by 0.025. 1 \u00f7 0.025 = 40 Therefore, the answer is (C) 40. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: 16.02 \u00c3\u2014 0.00001 = ? Answer Choices: (A) 0.1602 (B) 0.001602 (C) 1.6021 (D) 0.01602 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. 16.02 multiplied by 0.00001 can be written as: 16.02 x (1/100000) = 16.02/100000 = 0.0001602 So, the correct answer is (E) None of these. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: The division of a whole number N by 13 gives a quotient of 34 and a remainder of 2. Find N. Answer Choices: (A) 797 (B) 197 (C) 597 (D) 412 (E) 444\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that N divided by 13 gives a quotient of 34 and a remainder of 2. This can be written as: N = 13 x 34 + 2 N = 442 + 2 N = 444 Therefore, the answer is (E) 444. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
