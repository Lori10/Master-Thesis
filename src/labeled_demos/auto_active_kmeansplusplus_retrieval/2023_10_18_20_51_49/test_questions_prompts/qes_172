  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A bookseller sells his books at a 25% markup in price. If he sells a book for $12.5, how much did he pay for it? Answer Choices: (A) $14.40 (B) $14.00 (C) $11.00 (D) $9.60 (E) $10.00\nA: Let's think step by step. The bookseller sells his books at a 25% markup in price, which means he sells the book for 125% of its original price. Let's assume the original price of the book is x. Then, the selling price of the book is 1.25x. We know that the selling price of the book is $12.5. So, 1.25x = $12.5 Solving for x, we get x = $10. Therefore, the bookseller paid $10 for the book. The correct answer is (E) $10.00. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: The C.P of 15 books is equal to the S.P of 18 books. Find his gain% or loss%? Answer Choices: (A) 16 2/3% (B) 16 2/8% (C) 16 7/3% (D) 16 5/3% (E) 16 6/3%\nA: Let's think step by step. Given, C.P of 15 books = S.P of 18 books Let the cost price of 1 book be x. Then, the cost price of 15 books = 15x And, the selling price of 18 books = 18x Now, we need to find the gain or loss percentage. Gain or Loss percentage = [(Selling price - Cost price) / Cost price] x 100 Since the selling price is greater than the cost price, there is a gain. Gain percentage = [(18x - 15x) / 15x] x 100 = (3x / 15x) x 100 = 20% Therefore, the answer is not in the given options. The correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The cash difference between the selling prices of an article at a profit of 2% and 4% is Rs 3. The ratio of two selling prices is Answer Choices: (A) 51:52 (B) 52:53 (C) 53:54 (D) 54:55 (E) 51:52\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the cost price of the article be x. Selling price at a profit of 2% = 1.02x Selling price at a profit of 4% = 1.04x Given, the cash difference between the selling prices = Rs 3 So, 1.04x - 1.02x = 3 0.02x = 3 x = 150 Therefore, the selling price at a profit of 2% = 1.02 x 150 = Rs 153 The selling price at a profit of 4% = 1.04 x 150 = Rs 156 The ratio of the two selling prices = 153:156 Simplifying the ratio, we get 51:52 Hence, the answer is (A) 51:52. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Bert and Rebecca were looking at the price of a condominium. The price of the condominium was 80% more than Bert had in savings, and separately, the same price was also 20% more than Rebecca had in savings. What is the ratio of what Bert has in savings to what Rebecca has in savings. Answer Choices: (A) 1:4 (B) 4:1 (C) 2:3 (D) 3:2 (E) 3:4\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's say Bert has x amount of savings. Then the price of the condominium is 1.8x (80% more than Bert's savings). Similarly, let's say Rebecca has y amount of savings. Then the price of the condominium is 1.2y (20% more than Rebecca's savings). Since both of these expressions represent the same price, we can set them equal to each other: 1.8x = 1.2y Simplifying this equation, we get: x/y = 2/3 Therefore, the ratio of what Bert has in savings to what Rebecca has in savings is 2:3. The correct answer is (C) 2:3. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
