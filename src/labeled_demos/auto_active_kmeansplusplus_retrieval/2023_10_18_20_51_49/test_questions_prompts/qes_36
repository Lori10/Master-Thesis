  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If (x^2 + 1)y=8, which of the following is not a possible value for y? Answer Choices: (A) 8/2 (B) 2/5 (C) 18/3 (D) 3 (E) 17/2\nA: Let's think step by step. We are given the equation (x^2 + 1)y = 8. To find the possible values of y, we need to solve for y. Dividing both sides by (x^2 + 1), we get: y = 8/(x^2 + 1) So, any value of y that makes the denominator (x^2 + 1) equal to zero is not possible, as division by zero is undefined. The denominator (x^2 + 1) is always positive, so it can never be zero. Therefore, all the given answer choices are possible values of y. Hence, the answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Given the positive integer x, which of the following must be divisible by 3? Answer Choices: (A) x(x^2\u22122)  (B) (x\u22121) *x*(x+1)  (C) x(x+2) ^3 (D) x^2*(x\u22125)  (E) x^2*(x\u22125) \nA: Let's think step by step. To determine which of the given expressions is divisible by 3, we need to check if each expression is divisible by 3. (A) x(x^2\u22122) = x^3 - 2x. This expression may or may not be divisible by 3, depending on the value of x. For example, if x = 1, then the expression is -1, which is not divisible by 3. But if x = 3, then the expression is 25, which is not divisible by 3 either. Therefore, option A is not the correct answer. (B) (x\u22121) *x*(x+1) = x(x^2 - 1) = x^3 - x. This expression may or may not be divisible by 3, depending on the value of x. For example, if x = 1, then the expression is 0, which is divisible by 3. But if x = 2, then the expression is 6, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, option B could be the correct answer. (C) x(x+2)^3 = x(x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8) = x^4 + 6x^3 + 12x^2 + 8x. This expression may or may not be divisible by 3, depending on the value of x. For example, if x = 1, then the expression is 27, which is divisible by 3. But if x = 2, then the expression is 120, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, option C is not the correct answer. (D) x^2*(x\u22125) = x^3 - 5x^2. This expression may or may not be divisible by 3, depending on the value of x. For example, if x = 1, then the expression is -4, which is not divisible by 3. But if x = 3, then the expression is 18, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, option D could be the correct answer. (E) x^2*(x\u22125) = x^3 - 5x^2. This is the same expression as option D, so it cannot be the correct answer. Therefore, the correct answer is either option B or option D, depending on the value of x. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If (y - 1)(z - 3) + 5(y - 1) = 0, then which of the following must be true? Answer Choices: (A)  y = -4 and z = -3 (B)  y = 4 or z = -3 (C)  y = -4 or z = 3 (D)  y = 1 and z = 3 (E)  y = -1 or z = 3\nA: Let's think step by step. Expanding the left side of the equation, we get: yz - 3y - z + 3 + 5y - 5 = 0 Combining like terms, we get: yz + 2y - z - 2 = 0 Now we can factor out a (y + 1) from the first two terms and a -(z + 2) from the last two terms: (y + 1)(z + 2) = 0 Therefore, either y = -1 or z = -2. None of the answer choices match this result, so the correct answer is: None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: X is an even number and Y is a positive odd number. Which of the following expressions cannot be even? Answer Choices: (A) (XY) ^Y (B) X^3Y^3 (C) X^3 (D) XY (E) Y^2\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that X is even and Y is odd. (A) (XY)^Y: Since Y is odd, (XY)^Y will also be odd because an odd number raised to any power is odd. Therefore, this expression can't be even. (B) X^3Y^3: X is even and Y is odd, so X^3 will be even and Y^3 will be odd. Even * odd = even, so X^3Y^3 will be even. (C) X^3: X is even, so X^3 will also be even. (D) XY: Even * odd = even, so XY will be even. (E) Y^2: Y is odd, so Y^2 will be odd. Therefore, the expression that cannot be even is (A) (XY)^Y. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
