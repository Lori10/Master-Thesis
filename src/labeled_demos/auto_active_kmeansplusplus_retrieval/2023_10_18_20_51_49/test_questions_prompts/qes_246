If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: When sold at a 60% discount, a sweater nets the merchant a 20% profit on the wholesale cost at which he initially purchased the item. By what % is the sweater marked up from wholesale at its normal retail price? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 66.67% (D) 80% (E) 100%\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that the wholesale cost of the sweater is $100. If the merchant sells the sweater at a 60% discount, he sells it for 40% of the original price, which is $40. Now, we know that the merchant makes a 20% profit on the wholesale cost at which he initially purchased the item. So, the cost price for the merchant is $100, and he makes a profit of 20%, which is $20. Therefore, the selling price for the merchant is $120. We can now calculate the markup percentage from the wholesale price to the normal retail price. Markup percentage = (Selling price - Wholesale price) / Wholesale price x 100% Markup percentage = ($120 - $100) / $100 x 100% Markup percentage = 20% Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 20%. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A shopkeeper marks up the price of his goods by 20% and gives a discount of 10% to the customer. He also uses a 900g weight instead of 1Kg weight. Find his profit percentage. Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 12% (C) 20% (D) 30% (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume the cost price of the goods is $100. The shopkeeper marks up the price by 20%, so the selling price becomes $120. Next, the shopkeeper gives a discount of 10%, so the selling price becomes $108. Now, the shopkeeper uses a 900g weight instead of 1Kg weight. This means that the customer is paying for 100g less than what they think they are paying for. To calculate the profit percentage, we need to find the profit made by the shopkeeper. Profit = Selling price - Cost price Cost price = $100 (as assumed earlier) Selling price = $108 Profit = $108 - $100 = $8 Now, we need to calculate the profit percentage. Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost price) x 100 Profit percentage = (8 / 100) x 100 = 8% Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 8%. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A trader bought a car at 20% discount on its original price. He sold it at a 40% increase on the price he bought it. What percent of profit did he make on the original price? Answer Choices: (A) 17% (B) 17% (C) 12% (D) 82% (E) 92%\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. Let's assume that the original price of the car was $100. The trader bought the car at a 20% discount, which means he paid 80% of the original price, i.e., $80. He then sold the car at a 40% increase on the price he bought it, which means he sold it for 140% of the price he bought it, i.e., $112. Now, let's calculate the profit he made on the original price. Profit = Selling price - Cost price Profit = $112 - $100 Profit = $12 Therefore, the profit he made on the original price was $12. To calculate the percentage profit, we need to divide the profit by the original price and multiply by 100. Percentage profit = (Profit / Original price) x 100 Percentage profit = ($12 / $100) x 100 Percentage profit = 12% Therefore, the trader made a profit of 12% on the original price. Hence, the correct answer is option (C) 12%. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: By selling 300 apples a seller gains the selling price of 60 apples. The gain percent of the seller is Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 88 (C) 25 (D) 27 (E) 19\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the selling price of one apple is $1. Therefore, the selling price of 300 apples is $300 and the selling price of 60 apples is $60. The seller gains the selling price of 60 apples, which is $60. Profit percent = (Profit/Cost Price) x 100 Here, the profit is $60 and the cost price is the selling price of 240 apples (300-60), which is $240. Profit percent = (60/240) x 100 = 25% Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 25. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
