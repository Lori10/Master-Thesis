Answer Choices: (A) After 6 minutes (B) After 12 minutes (C) After 18 minutes (D) After 24 minutes (E) none",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: At 6'o clock clock ticks 6 times. The time between first and\nlast ticks was 30sec. How much time it takes at 12'o clock. Answer Choices: (A) 60sec (B) 62sec (C) 66sec (D) 64sec (E) 76sec\nA: Let's think step by step. At 6'o clock, the clock ticks 6 times, which means that each tick is 1/6th of a full rotation. The time between the first and last ticks is 30 seconds, and there are 5 intervals between the 6 ticks. Therefore, each interval is 30/5 = 6 seconds. At 12'o clock, the clock ticks 12 times, which means that each tick is 1/12th of a full rotation. Using the same logic as before, the time between the first and last ticks at 12'o clock would be 11 intervals of 1/12th of a rotation, which is 11/12ths of a full rotation. So, the time it takes between the first and last ticks at 12'o clock would be (11/12) * 60 seconds = 55 seconds. None of the answer choices match this result, so the answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: In a watch, the minute hand crosses the hour hand for the third time exactly after every 3 hrs., 18 min., 15 seconds of watch time. What is the time gained or lost by this watch in one day? Answer Choices: (A) 14 min. 10 seconds lost (B) 13 min. 50 seconds lost (C) 13 min. 20 seconds gained (D) 14 min. 40 seconds gained (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time taken by the minute hand to cross the hour hand once. The minute hand moves 12 times as fast as the hour hand (since it covers 12 hours in one rotation while the hour hand covers only 1 hour). So, the relative speed between the two hands is 11 times the speed of the hour hand. Therefore, the time taken by the minute hand to cross the hour hand once is 12/11 hours or 65 5/11 minutes. Now, we are given that the minute hand crosses the hour hand for the third time exactly after every 3 hrs., 18 min., 15 seconds of watch time. So, in one day (24 hours), the minute hand will cross the hour hand for the third time 8 times (since 24 divided by 3 is 8). Therefore, the total time taken by the minute hand to cross the hour hand 8 times is 8 times 65 5/11 minutes, which is equal to 522 2/11 minutes. Now, we need to convert this time into hours and minutes. 522 2/11 minutes is equal to 8 hours, 42 minutes, and 2 2/11 seconds. So, the watch gains 42 minutes and 2 2/11 seconds in one day. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 13 min. 20 seconds gained. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Two pipes A and B can fill a cistern in 10 and 15 minutes respectively. Both fill pipes are opened together,but at the end of 3 minutes, \u2018B\u2019 is turned off. How much time will the cistern take to fill ? Answer Choices: (A) 6 min (B) 8 min (C) 10 min (D) 12 min (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the capacity of the cistern is 'x' liters. In one minute, pipe A can fill 1/10th of the cistern, and pipe B can fill 1/15th of the cistern. When both pipes are opened together, they can fill 1/10 + 1/15 = 1/6th of the cistern in one minute. After 3 minutes, the cistern would have been filled with 3/6th or 1/2 of its capacity. Now, only pipe A is filling the remaining 1/2 of the cistern. In one minute, pipe A can fill 1/10th of the cistern. Therefore, the time taken to fill the remaining 1/2 of the cistern by pipe A alone would be 1/2 \u00f7 1/10 = 5 minutes. Therefore, the total time taken to fill the cistern would be 3 + 5 = 8 minutes. Hence, the correct answer is option (B) 8 min. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Which of the following is the Highest Common Factor of 18, 24 and 36? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 10 (C) 6 (D) 14 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the factors of each number: - Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18 - Factors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 - Factors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36 The common factors of all three numbers are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9. The highest common factor (HCF) is the largest of these common factors, which is 9. Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the correct answer. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
