Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold? Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: There are 25 balls in a jar. You take out 5 blue balls without putting them back inside, and now the probability of pulling out a blue ball is 1/5. How many blue balls were there in the beginning? Answer Choices: (A) 12. (B) 9. (C) 8. (D) 7. (E) 6.\nA: Let's think step by step. If the probability of pulling out a blue ball is 1/5 after taking out 5 blue balls, then there must be a total of 6 blue balls in the jar. To see why, let's use the formula for probability: P(event) = number of favorable outcomes / total number of outcomes Before taking out any balls, the probability of pulling out a blue ball was: P(blue) = number of blue balls / total number of balls After taking out 5 blue balls, there are now 20 balls left in the jar. The probability of pulling out a blue ball is now 1/5: P(blue) = number of blue balls left / total number of balls left We know that the total number of balls left is 20, so we can write: 1/5 = number of blue balls left / 20 Solving for the number of blue balls left, we get: number of blue balls left = 20 / 5 = 4 But we took out 5 blue balls, so the total number of blue balls in the jar must have been: total number of blue balls = number of blue balls left + number of blue balls taken out total number of blue balls = 4 + 5 = 9 Therefore, the answer is (B) 9. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: There are 5 bags three of which each contains 5 white and 2 black balls, and remaining 2 bags each contains 1 white and 4 black ball; a black ball has been drawn, find the chance that it came from second group. Answer Choices: (A) 2/7 (B) 6/35 (C) 8/25 (D) 28/43 (E) 3/5\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the probability of drawing a black ball from any of the bags. For the first three bags, the probability of drawing a black ball is 2/7 (since there are 2 black balls out of a total of 7 balls in each bag). For the remaining two bags, the probability of drawing a black ball is 4/5 (since there are 4 black balls out of a total of 5 balls in each bag). Now, we need to find the probability that the black ball came from the second group (the two bags with 1 white and 4 black balls). Let's call this event A. The probability of A happening is the probability of drawing a black ball from one of the two bags in the second group, which is (2/5) * 2 = 4/5 (since there are two bags in the second group, each with 5 balls). Let's call the event of drawing a black ball B. The probability of B happening is the probability of drawing a black ball from any of the five bags, which is (3 * 2/7) + (2 * 4/5) = 62/175. Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability of A given B: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) P(B|A) is the probability of drawing a black ball given that it came from the second group, which is 4/5. P(A) is the probability of A happening, which is 4/5. P(B) is the probability of B happening, which is 62/175. So, P(A|B) = (4/5) * (4/5) / (62/175) = 28/43 Therefore, the answer is (D) 28/43. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Find the number of ways you can fill a 3 x 3 grid (with 4 corners defined as a, b, c, d), if you\nhave 3 white marbles and 6 black marbles Answer Choices: (A) 9c3 (B) 9c2 (C) 9c4 (D) 8c3 (E) 7c3\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We need to choose 3 out of 9 cells to place the white marbles. This can be done in 9C3 ways. Step 2: After placing the white marbles, we need to fill the remaining 6 cells with black marbles. This can be done in only one way. Therefore, the total number of ways to fill the grid is 9C3 x 1 = 84. None of the answer choices match the correct answer. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A certain ski shop sells pairs of gloves in 10 different colors. If one pair of each color is dropped in a bag and a store clerk reaches in to draw two individual gloves simultaneously and at random, what is the probability that she draws two gloves of the same color? Answer Choices: (A) 1/144 (B) 1/143 (C) 1/24 (D) 1/23 (E) 1/19\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. There are 10 different colors of gloves, so there are 10 pairs of gloves in total. When the store clerk reaches in to draw two individual gloves simultaneously and at random, there are a total of 20 gloves in the bag. To calculate the probability of drawing two gloves of the same color, we need to first calculate the total number of possible outcomes. The total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to choose 2 gloves out of 20, which is: 20 choose 2 = (20 * 19) / (2 * 1) = 190 Next, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to choose 2 gloves of the same color. There are 10 different colors to choose from, so the number of ways to choose 2 gloves of the same color is: 10 choose 1 = 10 For each color, there are 2 gloves to choose from, so the total number of ways to choose 2 gloves of the same color is: 10 * (2 choose 2) = 10 Therefore, the probability of drawing two gloves of the same color is: 10 / 190 = 1/19 So the correct answer is (E) 1/19. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
