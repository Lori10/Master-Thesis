  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If the positive integer x is divisible by 3, 8, and 12, then which of the following must x be divisible by?\nI. 24\nII. 26\nIII. 48 Answer Choices: (A) IIonly (B) I only (C) I and II only (D) II and III only (E) I, II, and III\nA: Let's think step by step. If x is divisible by 3, 8, and 12, then it must be divisible by their least common multiple (LCM). The LCM of 3, 8, and 12 is 24. Therefore, x must be divisible by 24. Option I is correct. To check the other options: II. 26 is not a multiple of 3, 8, or 12, so x does not have to be divisible by 26. III. 48 is a multiple of 3, 8, and 12, but we already know that x is divisible by their LCM, which is 24. Therefore, x does not have to be divisible by 48. The correct answer is (B) I only. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: How many three-digit whole numbers yield a remainder of 1 when divided by 10 and also yield a remainder of 1 when divided by 6? Answer Choices: (A) None (B) One (C) Two (D) Three (E) Four\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 10. These numbers are of the form 10a + 1, where a is an integer. Next, we need to find the numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 6. These numbers are of the form 6b + 1, where b is an integer. To find the numbers that satisfy both conditions, we need to find the values of a and b that make 10a + 1 and 6b + 1 equal. 10a + 1 = 6b + 1 Simplifying, we get: 10a = 6b Dividing both sides by 2, we get: 5a = 3b This means that a must be a multiple of 3 and b must be a multiple of 5. The smallest three-digit number that satisfies both conditions is 121 (10*12+1). The next number is 181 (10*18+1). Therefore, the answer is (C) Two. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: How many positive integers less than 200 are there such that they are multiples of 13 or multiples of 12? Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 29 (C) 30 (D) 31 (E) 32\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We need to find the number of positive integers less than 200 that are either multiples of 13 or multiples of 12. To do this, we can first find the number of multiples of 13 less than 200 and the number of multiples of 12 less than 200. The largest multiple of 13 less than 200 is 13 x 15 = 195. The largest multiple of 12 less than 200 is 12 x 16 = 192. Now, we need to find the number of integers that are multiples of both 12 and 13. To do this, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 13, which is 156. The largest multiple of 156 less than 200 is 156 x 1 = 156. So, we need to count the number of multiples of 13 from 13 to 195 (inclusive), the number of multiples of 12 from 12 to 192 (inclusive), and subtract the number of multiples of 156 from the total. The number of multiples of 13 from 13 to 195 is (195-13)/13 + 1 = 15. The number of multiples of 12 from 12 to 192 is (192-12)/12 + 1 = 16. The number of multiples of 156 from 156 to 156 is 1. Therefore, the total number of positive integers less than 200 that are either multiples of 13 or multiples of 12 is 15 + 16 - 1 = 30. So, the answer is (C) 30. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If the number 52,1n9, where n represents the tens digit, is a multiple of 3, then the value of n could be which of the following? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 5 (C) 3 (D) 1 (E) 0\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine if a number is a multiple of 3, we need to add up its digits and see if the sum is a multiple of 3. So, 52,1n9 = 5 + 2 + 1 + n + 9 = 17 + n. For 17 + n to be a multiple of 3, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3. The only answer choice that works is (A) 6, because 17 + 6 = 23, which is a multiple of 3 (since 2 + 3 = 5, which is not a multiple of 3). Therefore, the value of n could be 6. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
