  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If on an item a company gives 25% discount, they earn 25% profit.If they now give 10% discount then what is the profit? Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 40 (C) 50 (D) 60 (E) 70\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the original price of the item is $100. With a 25% discount, the selling price becomes 75% of the original price, which is $75. Now, we know that the company earns a 25% profit on this selling price of $75. Profit = 25% of $75 = $18.75 So, the cost price of the item for the company is $75 - $18.75 = $56.25 If the company now gives a 10% discount, the selling price becomes 90% of $75, which is $67.50. The cost price for the company remains the same at $56.25. Profit = Selling price - Cost price = $67.50 - $56.25 = $11.25 Therefore, the profit is $11.25. The correct answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the calculated profit. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Eleven bags are bought for Rs.1000 and sold at 10 for Rs.1500. What is the gain or loss in percentage? Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 21% (C) 26% (D) 20% (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve the problem step by step. Let the cost price of one bag be x. So, the cost price of 11 bags will be 11x. The bags are sold at 10 for Rs.1500. So, the selling price of 10 bags will be Rs.1500. Therefore, the selling price of 1 bag will be Rs.150. So, the selling price of 11 bags will be 11 x Rs.150 = Rs.1650. Now, we can calculate the profit or loss percentage using the formula: Profit or loss percentage = (Profit or loss / Cost price) x 100 Profit or loss = Selling price - Cost price Cost price of 11 bags = Rs.1000 Selling price of 11 bags = Rs.1650 Profit or loss = Rs.1650 - Rs.1000 = Rs.650 Profit or loss percentage = (650/1000) x 100 = 65% Therefore, the answer is None of the above, as none of the given options match the calculated profit or loss percentage of 65%. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: By selling 300 apples a seller gains the selling price of 60 apples. The gain percent of the seller is Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 88 (C) 25 (D) 27 (E) 19\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the selling price of one apple is $1. Therefore, the selling price of 300 apples is $300 and the selling price of 60 apples is $60. The seller gains the selling price of 60 apples, which is $60. Profit percent = (Profit/Cost Price) x 100 Here, the profit is $60 and the cost price is the selling price of 240 apples (300-60), which is $240. Profit percent = (60/240) x 100 = 25% Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 25. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A shopkeeper marks up the price of his goods by 20% and gives a discount of 10% to the customer. He also uses a 900g weight instead of 1Kg weight. Find his profit percentage. Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 12% (C) 20% (D) 30% (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume the cost price of the goods is $100. The shopkeeper marks up the price by 20%, so the selling price becomes $120. Next, the shopkeeper gives a discount of 10%, so the selling price becomes $108. Now, the shopkeeper uses a 900g weight instead of 1Kg weight. This means that the customer is paying for 100g less than what they think they are paying for. To calculate the profit percentage, we need to find the profit made by the shopkeeper. Profit = Selling price - Cost price Cost price = $100 (as assumed earlier) Selling price = $108 Profit = $108 - $100 = $8 Now, we need to calculate the profit percentage. Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost price) x 100 Profit percentage = (8 / 100) x 100 = 8% Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 8%. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
