  "test_question": "Q: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5(\u221a3 + 1)  (B) 6(\u221a3 + \u221a2)  (C) 7(\u221a3 \u2013 1)  (D) 8(\u221a3 \u2013 2)  (E) None of these",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A train is 320 meter long is running at a speed of 45 km/hour. In what time will it pass a bridge of 140 meter length? Answer Choices: (A) 11 seconds (B) 38 seconds (C) 40 seconds (D) 88 seconds (E) 36.8 seconds\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed from km/hour to m/s. 45 km/hour = (45 * 1000) / (60 * 60) m/s = 12.5 m/s Next, we need to find the total distance the train will cover when passing the bridge. Total distance = length of train + length of bridge = 320 + 140 = 460 meters Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed time = 460 / 12.5 = 36.8 seconds Therefore, the answer is (E) 36.8 seconds. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: The speed of a car increases by 2 kms after every one hour. If the distance travelling in the first one hour was 35 kms. what was the total distance travelled in 12 hours? Answer Choices: (A) 456 kms (B) 482 kms (C) 552 kms (D) 556 kms (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. After the first hour, the car would have travelled 35 + 2 = 37 kms. After the second hour, the car would have travelled 37 + 2 = 39 kms. Similarly, after the third hour, the car would have travelled 41 kms, after the fourth hour, it would have travelled 43 kms, and so on. So, after 12 hours, the car would have travelled a total distance of: 35 + 37 + 39 + ... + 47 + 49 = (12/2) * (35 + 49) = 12 * 42 = 504 kms Therefore, the correct answer is (E) None of these, as none of the given options match the calculated answer. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A train 160 m long is running at a speed of 45 km/hr. In what time will it pass a bridge 140 m long? Answer Choices: (A) 40 sec (B) 50 sec (C) 44 sec (D) 24 sec (E) 60 sec\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed from km/hr to m/s. 45 km/hr = (45 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 12.5 m/s Next, we need to find the total distance the train needs to cover to pass the bridge. Total distance = length of train + length of bridge = 160 + 140 = 300 m Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed time = 300 / 12.5 = 24 sec Therefore, the answer is (D) 24 sec. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A driver covers a certain distance by car driving at 60 km/hr and returns back to the starting point riding on a scooter at 10 km/hr. What was the average speed for the whole journey? Answer Choices: (A) 14.2 km/h (B) 17.1 km/h (C) 19.3 km/h (D) 21.7 km/h (E) 23.5 km/h\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the distance covered by the driver is 'd' km. The time taken to cover the distance by car at 60 km/hr is given by: Time taken = Distance/Speed = d/60 The time taken to cover the same distance by scooter at 10 km/hr is given by: Time taken = Distance/Speed = d/10 The total time taken for the whole journey is the sum of the time taken for the onward journey and the time taken for the return journey. Total time taken = d/60 + d/10 = (d + 6d)/60 = 7d/60 The average speed for the whole journey is given by: Average speed = Total distance/Total time taken Total distance = 2d (since the driver covers the same distance twice) Average speed = 2d/(7d/60) = 120/7 km/hr Rounding off to one decimal place, we get the answer as (A) 14.2 km/h. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
