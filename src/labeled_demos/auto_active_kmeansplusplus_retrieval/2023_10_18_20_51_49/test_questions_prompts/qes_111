Answer Choices: (A) $880 (B) $990 (C) $1000 (D) $1100 (E) $1210\nA: Let's think step by step. The deposit amount is 10% of the total cost of the TV. Let's represent the total cost as \"x\". So, we can write the equation: 10% of x = $110 0.1x = $110 Solving for x: x = $1100 Therefore, the total cost of the TV is $1100. To find out how much remains to be paid, we need to subtract the deposit amount from the total cost: $1100 - $110 = $990 So, the answer is (B) $990. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: 8 people decided to split the restaurant bill evenly. If the bill was $214.18 dollars, how much money did they 1 cent is the smallest unit?

First, we need to divide the total bill by the number of people to find out how much each person should pay. $214.18 \u00f7 8 = $26.7725 Since we cannot have a fraction of a cent, we need to round up to the nearest cent. $26.77 rounds up to $26.78 Therefore, each person should pay $26.78. The closest answer choice is (B) $214.17, but that is not the correct answer. The correct answer is None of the above. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A camera lens filter kit containing 5 filters sells for $52.50. If the filters are purchased individually, 2 of them are priced at $6.45 each, 2 at $11.05 each, 1 at $15.50. The amount saved by purchasing the kit is what percent of the total price of the 5 filters purchased individually? Answer Choices: (A) 3.76% (B) 4.76% (C) 5.76% (D) 6.76% (E) 7.76%\nA: Let's think step by step. The total cost of purchasing the filters individually is: 2 x $6.45 + 2 x $11.05 + $15.50 = $31.50 The cost of purchasing the kit is $52.50. The amount saved by purchasing the kit is: $31.50 - $52.50 = -$21.00 This means that purchasing the kit costs $21.00 more than purchasing the filters individually. To find the percentage of the total price saved by purchasing the kit, we need to divide the amount saved by the total cost of purchasing the filters individually and then multiply by 100: (-$21.00 / $31.50) x 100 = -66.67% This means that purchasing the kit costs 66.67% more than purchasing the filters individually. However, the question asks for the percentage of the total price saved, not the percentage of the total price increased. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\n"
