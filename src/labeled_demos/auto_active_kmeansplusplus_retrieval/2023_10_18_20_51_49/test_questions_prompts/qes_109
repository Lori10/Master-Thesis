  "formatted_prompt": "Q: City X has a population 5 times as great as the population of City Y, which has a population twice as great as the population of City Z. What is the ratio of the population of City X to the population of City Z? Answer Choices: (A) 1:8 (B) 1:4 (C) 2:1 (D) 4:1 (E) 10:1\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the population of City Z is \"x\". According to the problem, the population of City Y is twice as great as City Z, so the population of City Y is 2x. Similarly, the population of City X is 5 times as great as City Y, so the population of City X is 5(2x) = 10x. Therefore, the ratio of the population of City X to the population of City Z is: 10x : x Simplifying this ratio, we get: 10 : 1 So the answer is (E) 10:1. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: At a contest with 2,500 participants, 1/2 of the people are aged 10 to 12. Next year, the number of people aged 10 to 12 will increase by 1/5. After this change, what percentage of the total 2,500 people will the 10- to 12-year-olds represent? Answer Choices: (A) 55% (B) 60% (C) 50% (D) 45% (E) 66%\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 at the contest. 1/2 of 2,500 = 1,250 people aged 10 to 12. Step 2: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1/5 of 1,250 = 250 people increase. 1,250 + 250 = 1,500 people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. Step 3: Find the percentage of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1,500/2,500 x 100% = 60% Therefore, the answer is (B) 60%. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: 10% of the inhabitants of a village having died of cholera, a panic set in, during which 25% of the remaining inhabitants left the village. The population is then reduced to 4050. Find the number of original inhabitants. Answer Choices: (A) 5000 (B) 6000 (C) 7000 (D) 8000 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Let the original number of inhabitants be x. Step 2: 10% of the inhabitants died of cholera, so the number of remaining inhabitants is 0.9x. Step 3: During the panic, 25% of the remaining inhabitants left, so the number of remaining inhabitants is 0.75(0.9x) = 0.675x. Step 4: We know that the current population is 4050, so we can set up an equation: 0.675x = 4050. Step 5: Solving for x, we get x = 6000. Therefore, the number of original inhabitants was 6000. The answer is (B) 6000. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: The output of a factory was increased by 10% to keep up with rising demand. To handle the holiday rush, this new output was increased by 25%. By approximately what percent would the output now have to be decreased in order to restore the original output? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 24% (C) 30% (D) 27% (E) 79%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the original output was 100 units. After the first increase of 10%, the new output became 110 units. After the second increase of 25%, the new output became 137.5 units (110 + 0.25*110). To restore the original output of 100 units, we need to decrease the current output of 137.5 units by a certain percentage. The percentage decrease can be calculated as follows: Percentage decrease = ((New value - Original value) / New value) * 100 = ((137.5 - 100) / 137.5) * 100 = 27.27% Therefore, the output now has to be decreased by approximately 27% to restore the original output. The closest answer choice is (D) 27%. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
