  "test_question": "Q: Professors borrowed Rs. 5000 from the university at simple interest. After 3 years, the university got Rs. 300 on interest. What was the rate of interest per annum? Answer Choices: (A) 2% (B) 8% (C) 5% (D) 10% (E) None of these",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: An amount of Rs. 3000 becomes Rs. 3600 in four years at simple interest. If the rate of interest was 1% more, then what was be the total amount? Answer Choices: (A) 3728 (B) 3726 (C) 3720 (D) 3722 (E) 3721\nA: Let's think step by step. Given, Principal (P) = Rs. 3000, Time (t) = 4 years, Simple Interest (SI) = Rs. 3600 - Rs. 3000 = Rs. 600. Using the formula for simple interest, we can find the rate of interest (R): SI = (P * R * t) / 100 600 = (3000 * R * 4) / 100 R = 5% Now, if the rate of interest is 1% more, then the new rate of interest (R') would be: R' = R + 1% = 5 + 0.01 = 0.06 Using the same formula for simple interest, we can find the new amount (A): A = P + SI A = 3000 + (3000 * 0.06 * 4) / 100 A = Rs. 3720 Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 3720. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A certain amount earns simple interest of Rs. 1750 after 7 years. Had the interest been 2% more, how much more interest would it have earned? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 35 (B) Rs. 245 (C) Rs. 350 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Given, the amount earns simple interest of Rs. 1750 after 7 years. Let the principal amount be P and the rate of interest be R. Simple Interest formula is given by: S.I. = (P * R * T) / 100 Here, S.I. = Rs. 1750, T = 7 years So, 1750 = (P * R * 7) / 100 => PR = 25000 Now, if the interest rate is increased by 2%, the new rate of interest will be R + 2. New S.I. = (P * (R + 2) * T) / 100 New S.I. - Old S.I. = [(P * (R + 2) * T) / 100] - [(P * R * T) / 100] = (P * 2 * T) / 100 = (P * 2 * 7) / 100 = (14P / 100) = 0.14P We don't know the value of P, so we cannot determine the exact amount of increased interest. Therefore, the answer is (D) Cannot be determined. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Find the amount on Rs.8000 in 9 months at 20% per annum, if the interest being compounded quarterly? Answer Choices: (A) 2888 (B) 2690 (C) 2668 (D) 9261 (E) 2312\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve the problem step by step. Given, Principal (P) = Rs. 8000, Rate of interest (R) = 20% per annum, Time (t) = 9 months and interest is compounded quarterly. First, we need to calculate the interest rate per quarter. Rate of interest per quarter (r) = R/4 = 20/4 = 5% Now, we can use the formula for compound interest: Amount (A) = P(1 + r/100)^(n) where n is the number of quarters. n = (9 months)/3 months per quarter = 3 quarters Substituting the values, we get: A = 8000(1 + 5/100)^(3) = 8000(21/20)^3 A = 8000(9261/8000) = Rs. 9261 Therefore, the correct answer is option (D) 9261. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A sum of money at simple interest amounts to Rs. 815 in 2 years and to Rs. 854 in 4 years. The sum is: Answer Choices: (A) s. 650 (B) s. 690 (C) s. 698 (D) s. 700 (E) s. 737\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the principal be P and the rate of interest be R. According to the problem, we have: P + (P*R*2/100) = 815 (since the sum amounts to Rs. 815 in 2 years) P + (P*R*4/100) = 854 (since the sum amounts to Rs. 854 in 4 years) Simplifying these equations, we get: P + 0.02PR = 815 P + 0.04PR = 854 Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get: 0.02PR = 39 PR = 1950 Substituting PR = 1950 in the first equation, we get: P + 39 = 815 P = 776 Therefore, the sum is Rs. 776. None of the above answer choices are correct. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
