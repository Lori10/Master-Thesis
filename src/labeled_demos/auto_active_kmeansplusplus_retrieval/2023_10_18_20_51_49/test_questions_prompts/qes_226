  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The length of a rectangular plot is 20 metres more than its breadth. If the cost of fencing the plot @ Rs. 26.50 per metre is Rs. 7420, what is the length of the plot in metres? Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 200 (C) 300 (D) 400 (E) 80\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the breadth of the rectangular plot be x metres. Then, the length of the plot is (x+20) metres. The cost of fencing the plot is Rs. 26.50 per metre. Therefore, the total cost of fencing the rectangular plot is: Perimeter of the plot x Cost per metre = (2 x length + 2 x breadth) x 26.50 Substituting the values of length and breadth, we get: (2(x+20) + 2x) x 26.50 = 7420 Simplifying the equation, we get: 6.5x + 530 = 371 6.5x = 371 - 530 6.5x = -159 x = -24.46 Since the breadth cannot be negative, this answer is not possible. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: What will be the cost of building a fence around a square plot with area equal to 289 sq ft, if the price per foot of building the fence is Rs. 58? Answer Choices: (A) Rs.3944 (B) Rs.3948 (C) Rs.3942 (D) Rs.3965 (E) Rs.3929\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length of one side of the square plot. We know that the area of the square is 289 sq ft, so we can take the square root of 289 to get the length of one side: \u221a289 = 17 Therefore, the length of one side of the square plot is 17 ft. Next, we need to find the perimeter of the square plot, which is the total length of the fence we need to build. Since all sides of a square are equal, we can simply multiply the length of one side by 4: 17 x 4 = 68 So we need to build a fence that is 68 ft long. Finally, we can calculate the cost of building the fence by multiplying the length of the fence by the price per foot: 68 x 58 = 3944 Therefore, the cost of building the fence is Rs. 3944. The correct answer is (A) Rs.3944. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: What is the perimeter, in meters, of a rectangular garden 24 meters wide that has the same area as a rectangular playground 16 meters long and 12 meters wide? Answer Choices: (A) 48 (B) 56 (C) 64 (D) 76 (E) 192\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the area of the playground: Area = length x width = 16 x 12 = 192 square meters Since the garden has the same area, its length must be: Length = Area / width = 192 / 24 = 8 meters Now we can calculate the perimeter of the garden: Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 2(8 + 24) = 2(32) = 64 meters Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 64. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A rectangular lawn of dimensions 80 m * 60 m has two roads each 10 m wide running in the middle of the lawn, one parallel to the length and the other parallel to the breadth. What is the cost of traveling the two roads at Rs.3 per sq m? Answer Choices: (A) 3929 (B) 3998 (C) 3128 (D) 3900 (E) 3920\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the area of the lawn. Area of the lawn = length * breadth = 80 * 60 = 4800 sq m Next, we need to calculate the area of the two roads. Area of road parallel to length = length of road * breadth of lawn = 10 * 60 = 600 sq m Area of road parallel to breadth = length of road * breadth of lawn = 10 * 80 = 800 sq m Total area of the two roads = 600 + 800 = 1400 sq m Now, we need to calculate the cost of traveling the two roads at Rs.3 per sq m. Cost of traveling the two roads = Total area of the two roads * cost per sq m = 1400 * 3 = 4200 None of the answer choices match the calculated answer, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
