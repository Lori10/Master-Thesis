  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Ratio between Rahul and Deepak is 4:3, After 6 Years Rahul age will be 18 years. What is Deepak present age? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 15 (C) 77 (D) 9 (E) 182\nA: Let's think step by step. Given, the ratio of Rahul and Deepak's age is 4:3. Let's assume their ages to be 4x and 3x respectively. After 6 years, Rahul's age will be 18 years. So, his present age is 18 - 6 = 12 years. We can now use this information to find the value of x. 4x = 12 x = 3 Therefore, Rahul's present age is 4x = 4 * 3 = 12 years. Now, we can find Deepak's present age. Deepak's age = 3x = 3 * 3 = 9 years. Hence, the correct answer is (D) 9. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: In how many ways can 5 boys and 3 girls be seated on 8 chairs so that no two girls are together? Answer Choices: (A) A) 5760 (B) B) 14400 (C) C) 480 (D) D) 56 (E) E) 40320\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We can seat the 5 boys in 5! ways. Step 2: We can create 4 gaps between the boys where the girls can be seated. For example, if the boys are seated as B1 B2 B3 B4 B5, the gaps are _B1_, B1_B2_, B2_B3_, B3_B4_, _B4_, where _ represents an empty chair. The girls can be seated in any 3 of these gaps in 3! ways. Step 3: We can seat the 3 girls in the chosen gaps in 3! ways. Therefore, the total number of ways to seat the boys and girls is 5! x 4 x 3! x 3! = 14,400. The answer is (B) 14,400. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: The division of a whole number N by 13 gives a quotient of 34 and a remainder of 2. Find N. Answer Choices: (A) 797 (B) 197 (C) 597 (D) 412 (E) 444\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that N divided by 13 gives a quotient of 34 and a remainder of 2. This can be written as: N = 13 x 34 + 2 N = 442 + 2 N = 444 Therefore, the answer is (E) 444. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: 12+6=792\n10+2=110\n1+9=9\n2+7=16\n11+4=??\nSolve it? Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 190 (D) 160 (E) 154\nA: Let's think step by step. In the first equation, 12+6=18. In the second equation, 10+2=12. In the third equation, 1+9=10. In the fourth equation, 2+7=9. To solve the fifth equation, we need to find a pattern in the given equations. We can see that the sum of the two numbers in each equation is multiplied by the second number to get the answer. For example, in the first equation, (12+6) x 6 = 108, which is the answer. Using the same pattern, we can solve the fifth equation: (11+4) x 4 = 60. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\n"
