  "test_question": "Q: Christopher and Jonathan were having bets. They decide that a coin will be flipped twenty times and each time it turns heads, Christopher will give $2 to Jonathan and each time it turns out to be Tails, Jonathan will give 3$ to Christopher. After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount.\nHow many times did the coin landed on Heads ? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 23 (C) 16 (D) 18 (E) 12",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In a game, a person is declared winner, if he gets 4 consecutive tails in five throws of a coin. What is the probability of A to win if he has got a tail in the first throw? Answer Choices: (A) 1/5 (B) 1/4 (C) 1/8 (D) 1/16 (E) 1/6\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that A has already gotten a tail in the first throw. Now, in order to win, A needs to get 3 more consecutive tails in the next 4 throws. The probability of getting a tail in any given throw is 1/2 (assuming a fair coin). So, the probability of getting 4 consecutive tails in 5 throws can be calculated as follows: Probability = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/32 However, we need to take into account that A has already gotten a tail in the first throw. So, we only need to consider the probability of getting 3 consecutive tails in the next 4 throws. Probability = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16 Therefore, the probability of A winning if he has already gotten a tail in the first throw is 1/16. The correct answer is (D) 1/16. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: When tossed, a certain six-sided die has an equal probability of landing on any of the six sides. If the die is tossed 3 times, what is the probability that it will land on the same side each time? Answer Choices: (A) 1/6 (B) 1/12 (C) 1/36 (D) 1/72 (E) 1/216\nA: Let's think step by step. The probability of the die landing on the same side each time is the product of the probabilities of it landing on that side each time. Since there are 6 sides, the probability of it landing on a specific side on any given toss is 1/6. Therefore, the probability of it landing on the same side all 3 times is (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) = 1/216. So the correct answer is (E) 1/216. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In a single throw of a die, what is the probability of getting a number greater than 4? Answer Choices: (A) 1/2 (B) 1/3 (C) 2/3 (D) 1/4 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. There are six possible outcomes when a die is thrown, which are the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Out of these six outcomes, only two are greater than 4, which are 5 and 6. Therefore, the probability of getting a number greater than 4 is 2/6 or 1/3. So, the correct answer is (B) 1/3. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Peter rolls two dice at the same time. What is the probability that the total sum of numbers on the dices is 3? Answer Choices: (A) a)  1/12 (B) b)  1/36 (C) c)  1/6 (D) d)  1/18 (E) e)  1/3\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice, as each die has 6 possible outcomes. To get a sum of 3, the only possible outcomes are (1,2) and (2,1). Therefore, there are only 2 favorable outcomes out of 36 possible outcomes. So, the probability of getting a sum of 3 is 2/36, which simplifies to 1/18. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) d) 1/18. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
