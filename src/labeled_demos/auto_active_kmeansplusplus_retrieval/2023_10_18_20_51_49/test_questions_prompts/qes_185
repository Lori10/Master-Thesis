  "test_question": "Q: 10kg of a mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. In order to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand? Answer Choices: (A) 10/7 (B) 20/7 (C) 30/7 (D) 40/7 (E) 50/7",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Solution A is 10% salt and Solution B is 80% salt. If you have 30 ounces of solution A and 60 ounces of solution B, in what ratio could you mix Solution A with Solution B to produce 50 ounces of a 50% salt solution? Answer Choices: (A) 6:4 (B) 6:14 (C) 3:4 (D) 4:6 (E) 3:7\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Calculate the amount of salt in Solution A and Solution B. - Solution A: 10% of 30 ounces = 3 ounces of salt - Solution B: 80% of 60 ounces = 48 ounces of salt Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the amount of salt in the final mixture. - Let x be the amount of Solution A needed to make 50 ounces of a 50% salt solution. - Then, (50 - x) is the amount of Solution B needed. - The equation is: 0.1x + 0.8(50 - x) = 0.5(50) Step 3: Solve for x. - 0.1x + 40 - 0.8x = 25 - -0.7x = -15 - x = 21.43 Step 4: Calculate the ratio of Solution A to Solution B. - Solution A: 21.43 ounces - Solution B: 50 - 21.43 = 28.57 ounces - Ratio of Solution A to Solution B = 21.43:28.57 = 3:4 Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 3:4. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Salad dressing P is made up of 30% vinegar and 70% oil, and salad dressing Q contains 10% vinegar and 90% oil. If the two dressings are combined to produce a salad dressing that is 12% vinegar, dressing P comprises what percentage of the new dressing? Answer Choices: (A) 50% (B) 40% (C) 30% (D) 20% (E) 10%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that we have 100 ml of the new salad dressing. Let x be the percentage of dressing P in the new dressing. Then, we can write: - The amount of vinegar in dressing P = 30% of x ml - The amount of vinegar in dressing Q = 10% of (100 - x) ml (since the total amount of dressing is 100 ml and we have x ml of dressing P) - The amount of vinegar in the new dressing = 12% of 100 ml = 12 ml Since we are combining the two dressings, the total amount of vinegar in the new dressing is the sum of the amount of vinegar in dressing P and dressing Q. So, we can write: 0.3x + 0.1(100 - x) = 12 Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.2x + 10 = 12 0.2x = 2 x = 10 Therefore, dressing P comprises 10% of the new dressing. The correct answer is (E) 10%. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: By weight, liquid X makes up 0.5 percent of solution P and 1.5 percent of solution Q. If 200 grams of solution P are mixed with 800 grams of solution Q, then liquid X accounts for what percent of the weight of the resulting solution? Answer Choices: (A) 1.3% (B) 1.2% (C) 1.1% (D) 1.0% (E) 0.9%\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much liquid X is in 200 grams of solution P and 800 grams of solution Q. Liquid X in 200 grams of solution P = 0.5% of 200 grams = 1 gram Liquid X in 800 grams of solution Q = 1.5% of 800 grams = 12 grams Total liquid X in the resulting solution = 1 gram + 12 grams = 13 grams Now, we need to find out what percent of the weight of the resulting solution is 13 grams. Total weight of resulting solution = 200 grams + 800 grams = 1000 grams Percent of liquid X in the resulting solution = (13 grams / 1000 grams) x 100% = 1.3% Therefore, the answer is (A) 1.3%. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Arun purchased 30 kg of wheat at the rate of Rs. 11.50 per kg and 20 kg of wheat at the rate of 14.25 per kg. He mixed the two and sold the mixture. Approximately what price per kg should be sell the mixture to make 35% profit? Answer Choices: (A) 16.39 (B) 16.33 (C) 16.35 (D) 17.01 (E) 16.32\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost price of the wheat that Arun purchased: Cost price of 30 kg of wheat = 30 x 11.50 = Rs. 345 Cost price of 20 kg of wheat = 20 x 14.25 = Rs. 285 Total cost price = 345 + 285 = Rs. 630 Now, Arun wants to make a 35% profit on this cost price. So, the selling price of the mixture should be: Selling price = Cost price + Profit Profit = 35% of Cost price = 0.35 x 630 = Rs. 220.50 Selling price = 630 + 220.50 = Rs. 850.50 Finally, we need to find the price per kg of the mixture. Arun has a total of 50 kg of wheat (30 kg + 20 kg), so: Price per kg = Selling price / Total quantity Price per kg = 850.50 / 50 = Rs. 17.01 Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 17.01. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
