  "test_question": "Q: A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day? Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A sports retailer ordered white and yellow tennis balls in equal number but the dispatch clerk of the tennis ball company erred and dispatched 50 extra yellow balls and making ratio of white balls to yellow balls 7/11. How many tennis balls did the retailer order originally. Answer Choices: (A) 17.5 (B) 130 (C) 175 (D) 195 (E) 220\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the retailer originally ordered x number of white and yellow tennis balls each. According to the problem, the dispatch clerk dispatched 50 extra yellow balls. So, the total number of yellow balls became (x + 50) and the number of white balls remained x. Now, the ratio of white balls to yellow balls is given as 7/11. So, we can write the equation: x/(x+50) = 7/11 Cross-multiplying, we get: 11x = 7(x+50) 11x = 7x + 350 4x = 350 x = 87.5 Therefore, the retailer originally ordered 87.5 white and 87.5 yellow tennis balls each. But since we need to find the total number of tennis balls, we add them up: 87.5 + 87.5 + 50 (extra yellow balls) = 225 So, the correct answer is (None of the above) 225. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Given a bag with 2 red balls and 3 yellow balls, you randomly select one of them, in order. If the second ball you take is yellow, what is the probability that the first one was also yellow? Answer Choices: (A) 1/2 (B) 1/5 (C) 3/4 (D) 1/3 (E) 3/5\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the probability of selecting a yellow ball on the first draw. This is simply 3/5 since there are 3 yellow balls out of a total of 5 balls. Next, we need to find the probability of selecting a yellow ball on the second draw given that the first ball was yellow. Since we already know that the first ball was yellow, there are now only 4 balls left in the bag, with 2 of them being yellow. Therefore, the probability of selecting a yellow ball on the second draw is 2/4 or 1/2. Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the first ball was yellow given that the second ball was yellow. Let Y1 and Y2 denote the events that the first and second balls are yellow, respectively. Then, we want to find P(Y1|Y2), which is given by: P(Y1|Y2) = P(Y2|Y1) * P(Y1) / P(Y2) We already know that P(Y1) = 3/5 and P(Y2|Y1) = 1/2. To find P(Y2), we can use the law of total probability: P(Y2) = P(Y2|Y1) * P(Y1) + P(Y2|not Y1) * P(not Y1) Since there are only 2 possibilities for the first ball (yellow or not yellow), we have: P(not Y1) = 1 - P(Y1) = 2/5 P(Y2|not Y1) = 2/3 (since there are 2 yellow balls left out of a total of 3 balls) Plugging in the values, we get: P(Y1|Y2) = (1/2) * (3/5) / [(1/2) * (3/5) + (2/3) * (2/5)] = 3/4 Therefore, the answer is (C) 3/4. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Amanda goes to the toy store to buy 1 ball and 3 different board games. If the toy store is stocked with 3 types of balls and 6 types of board games, how many different selections E of the 4 items can Amanda make? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 12 (C) 14 (D) 15 (E) 60\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Amanda can choose 1 ball out of 3 types of balls. This can be done in 3 ways. Next, she can choose 3 board games out of 6 types of board games. This can be done in 6C3 ways, which is equal to 20. Therefore, the total number of different selections E of the 4 items that Amanda can make is 3 x 20 = 60. So, the correct answer is (E) 60. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: There are 25 balls in a jar. You take out 5 blue balls without putting them back inside, and now the probability of pulling out a blue ball is 1/5. How many blue balls were there in the beginning? Answer Choices: (A) 12. (B) 9. (C) 8. (D) 7. (E) 6.\nA: Let's think step by step. If the probability of pulling out a blue ball is 1/5 after taking out 5 blue balls, then there must be a total of 6 blue balls in the jar. To see why, let's use the formula for probability: P(event) = number of favorable outcomes / total number of outcomes Before taking out any balls, the probability of pulling out a blue ball was: P(blue) = number of blue balls / total number of balls After taking out 5 blue balls, there are now 20 balls left in the jar. The probability of pulling out a blue ball is now 1/5: P(blue) = number of blue balls left / total number of balls left We know that the total number of balls left is 20, so we can write: 1/5 = number of blue balls left / 20 Solving for the number of blue balls left, we get: number of blue balls left = 20 / 5 = 4 But we took out 5 blue balls, so the total number of blue balls in the jar must have been: total number of blue balls = number of blue balls left + number of blue balls taken out total number of blue balls = 4 + 5 = 9 Therefore, the answer is (B) 9. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
