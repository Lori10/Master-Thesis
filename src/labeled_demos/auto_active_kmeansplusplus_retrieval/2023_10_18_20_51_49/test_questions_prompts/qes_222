  "test_question": "Q: The population of a city is 5265526. If there are 4169516 adults in the city, how many children are there in the city? Answer Choices: (A) 1095961 (B) 1065961 (C) 1085961 (D) 1097961 (E) 1096061",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: City X has a population 5 times as great as the population of City Y, which has a population twice as great as the population of City Z. What is the ratio of the population of City X to the population of City Z? Answer Choices: (A) 1:8 (B) 1:4 (C) 2:1 (D) 4:1 (E) 10:1\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the population of City Z is \"x\". According to the problem, the population of City Y is twice as great as City Z, so the population of City Y is 2x. Similarly, the population of City X is 5 times as great as City Y, so the population of City X is 5(2x) = 10x. Therefore, the ratio of the population of City X to the population of City Z is: 10x : x Simplifying this ratio, we get: 10 : 1 So the answer is (E) 10:1. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A group of 55 adults and 70 children go for trekking. If there is meal for either 70 adults or 90 children and if 28 adults have their meal, find the total number of children that can be catered with the remaining food. Answer Choices: (A) 42 (B) 54 (C) 90 (D) 70 (E) 80\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that there are 55 adults and 70 children, so the total number of people is 55 + 70 = 125. Step 2: We also know that there is enough food for either 70 adults or 90 children. Since there are only 55 adults, we can assume that the remaining food is for the children. Step 3: 28 adults have already had their meal, so the number of adults left is 55 - 28 = 27. Step 4: We need to find out how many children can be catered with the remaining food. Since the remaining food is for either 70 adults or 90 children, we can set up a proportion: 70 adults = 90 children 1 adult = 90/70 children 27 adults = (90/70) x 27 children 27 adults = 34.29 children (rounded to two decimal places) Step 5: Since we can't have a fraction of a child, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the total number of children that can be catered with the remaining food is 35. Answer: None of the above (the closest option is A, but it is not the correct answer). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: 10% of the inhabitants of a village having died of cholera, a panic set in, during which 25% of the remaining inhabitants left the village. The population is then reduced to 4050. Find the number of original inhabitants. Answer Choices: (A) 5000 (B) 6000 (C) 7000 (D) 8000 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Let the original number of inhabitants be x. Step 2: 10% of the inhabitants died of cholera, so the number of remaining inhabitants is 0.9x. Step 3: During the panic, 25% of the remaining inhabitants left, so the number of remaining inhabitants is 0.75(0.9x) = 0.675x. Step 4: We know that the current population is 4050, so we can set up an equation: 0.675x = 4050. Step 5: Solving for x, we get x = 6000. Therefore, the number of original inhabitants was 6000. The answer is (B) 6000. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: At a contest with 2,500 participants, 1/2 of the people are aged 10 to 12. Next year, the number of people aged 10 to 12 will increase by 1/5. After this change, what percentage of the total 2,500 people will the 10- to 12-year-olds represent? Answer Choices: (A) 55% (B) 60% (C) 50% (D) 45% (E) 66%\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 at the contest. 1/2 of 2,500 = 1,250 people aged 10 to 12. Step 2: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1/5 of 1,250 = 250 people increase. 1,250 + 250 = 1,500 people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. Step 3: Find the percentage of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1,500/2,500 x 100% = 60% Therefore, the answer is (B) 60%. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
