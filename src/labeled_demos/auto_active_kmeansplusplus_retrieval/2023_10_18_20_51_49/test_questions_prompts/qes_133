  "test_question": "Q: A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet? Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 81 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) None",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The length of a rectangular floor is more than its breadth by 200%. If Rs.441 is required to paint the floor at the rate of Rs.3/sq m, what would be the length of the floor? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 18 (C) 20 (D) 21 (E) 24\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the breadth of the rectangular floor to be x meters. According to the question, the length of the floor is more than its breadth by 200%, which means the length is equal to x + 2x = 3x meters. The area of the rectangular floor is given by length x breadth, which is 3x * x = 3x^2 square meters. We know that the cost of painting 1 square meter of the floor is Rs.3. Therefore, the cost of painting 3x^2 square meters of the floor is 3 * 3x^2 = 9x^2 rupees. We are given that the cost of painting the floor is Rs.441. Therefore, 9x^2 = 441 Solving for x, we get x = 7. Therefore, the length of the floor is 3x = 3 * 7 = 21 meters. Hence, the answer is (D) 21. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A man cycles round the boundary of a rectangular park at the rate of 12 kmph and completes one full round in 8 minutes. If the ratio between the length and breadth of the park be 3:2, then its area is: Answer Choices: (A) 1536m2 (B) 15360m2 (C) 153600m2 (D) 163600m2 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular park. Let the length and breadth of the park be 3x and 2x respectively (as given in the ratio 3:2). Perimeter of the park = 2(Length + Breadth) = 2(3x + 2x) = 10x Now, we know that the man cycles round the park at the rate of 12 kmph. In 1 hour, he covers a distance of 12 km. In 1 minute, he covers a distance of 12/60 = 0.2 km = 200 m. In 8 minutes, he covers a distance of 200 x 8 = 1600 m = 1.6 km. We also know that in 8 minutes, he completes one full round of the park. Therefore, 10x = 1.6 km x = 160 m Length of the park = 3x = 480 m Breadth of the park = 2x = 320 m Area of the park = Length x Breadth = 480 x 320 = 153600 m\u00b2 Hence, the correct answer is (C) 153600m\u00b2. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: What is the perimeter, in meters, of a rectangular garden 24 meters wide that has the same area as a rectangular playground 16 meters long and 12 meters wide? Answer Choices: (A) 48 (B) 56 (C) 64 (D) 76 (E) 192\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the area of the playground: Area = length x width = 16 x 12 = 192 square meters Since the garden has the same area, its length must be: Length = Area / width = 192 / 24 = 8 meters Now we can calculate the perimeter of the garden: Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 2(8 + 24) = 2(32) = 64 meters Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 64. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: What will be the cost of building a fence around a square plot with area equal to 289 sq ft, if the price per foot of building the fence is Rs. 58? Answer Choices: (A) Rs.3944 (B) Rs.3948 (C) Rs.3942 (D) Rs.3965 (E) Rs.3929\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length of one side of the square plot. We know that the area of the square is 289 sq ft, so we can take the square root of 289 to get the length of one side: \u221a289 = 17 Therefore, the length of one side of the square plot is 17 ft. Next, we need to find the perimeter of the square plot, which is the total length of the fence we need to build. Since all sides of a square are equal, we can simply multiply the length of one side by 4: 17 x 4 = 68 So we need to build a fence that is 68 ft long. Finally, we can calculate the cost of building the fence by multiplying the length of the fence by the price per foot: 68 x 58 = 3944 Therefore, the cost of building the fence is Rs. 3944. The correct answer is (A) Rs.3944. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
