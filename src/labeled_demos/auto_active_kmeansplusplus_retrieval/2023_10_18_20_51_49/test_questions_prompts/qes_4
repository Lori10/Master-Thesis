  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The value of (0.2\u00d70.2+0.01) (0.1\u00d70.1+0.02)-1 is equal to Answer Choices: (A) 5/3 (B) 9/5 (C) 41/4 (D) 41/12 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can simplify the expression inside the parentheses: (0.2\u00d70.2+0.01) = 0.041 (0.1\u00d70.1+0.02) = 0.012 So now we have: 0.041 \u00d7 0.012 - 1 Simplifying further: 0.000492 - 1 -0.999508 None of the answer choices match this result, so the answer is: (E) None The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: There are two numbers. If 20% of the first number is added to the second number, then the second number increases to its five-fourth. Find the ratio of the first number to the second number? Answer Choices: (A) A) 5/4 (B) B) 5/8 (C) C) 6 (D) D) 6/7 (E) E) 7\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the first number be x and the second number be y. According to the problem, we know that: y + 0.2x = (5/4)y Simplifying this equation: 0.2x = (1/4)y x/y = (1/4)/(1/5) x/y = 5/4 Therefore, the answer is (A) 5/4. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: 5 persons A,B,C,D and E occupy seats in a row at random. What is the probability that A and B sit next to each other ? Answer Choices: (A) 3/5 (B) 2/5 (C) 1/5 (D) 8/5 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 5 people, so there are 5! = 120 ways to arrange them in a row. Now, let's consider A and B as a single entity, AB. Then, there are 4! = 24 ways to arrange the entities AB, C, D, and E in a row. However, within the entity AB, there are 2! = 2 ways to arrange A and B. So, there are 2 x 4! = 48 ways for A and B to sit next to each other. Therefore, the probability of A and B sitting next to each other is 48/120 = 2/5. The correct answer is (B) 2/5. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: There are 5 bags three of which each contains 5 white and 2 black balls, and remaining 2 bags each contains 1 white and 4 black ball; a black ball has been drawn, find the chance that it came from second group. Answer Choices: (A) 2/7 (B) 6/35 (C) 8/25 (D) 28/43 (E) 3/5\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the probability of drawing a black ball from any of the bags. For the first three bags, the probability of drawing a black ball is 2/7 (since there are 2 black balls out of a total of 7 balls in each bag). For the remaining two bags, the probability of drawing a black ball is 4/5 (since there are 4 black balls out of a total of 5 balls in each bag). Now, we need to find the probability that the black ball came from the second group (the two bags with 1 white and 4 black balls). Let's call this event A. The probability of A happening is the probability of drawing a black ball from one of the two bags in the second group, which is (2/5) * 2 = 4/5 (since there are two bags in the second group, each with 5 balls). Let's call the event of drawing a black ball B. The probability of B happening is the probability of drawing a black ball from any of the five bags, which is (3 * 2/7) + (2 * 4/5) = 62/175. Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability of A given B: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) P(B|A) is the probability of drawing a black ball given that it came from the second group, which is 4/5. P(A) is the probability of A happening, which is 4/5. P(B) is the probability of B happening, which is 62/175. So, P(A|B) = (4/5) * (4/5) / (62/175) = 28/43 Therefore, the answer is (D) 28/43. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
