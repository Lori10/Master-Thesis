If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A, B can Complete a work in 15 days &10 days respectively. They started doing thework together after 2 days B had to leave and A alone completed the remaining work.The whole work wascompleted in how many days? Answer Choices: (A) 8 days (B) 10 days (C) 12 days (D) 14 days (E) 16 days\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the total work is 150 units (LCM of 15 and 10). In one day, A can complete 10 units of work (150/15) and B can complete 15 units of work (150/10). Together, in one day, they can complete 25 units of work (10+15). After 2 days, the total work completed by A and B together is 50 units (25*2). So, the remaining work is 100 units (150-50). Now, A alone has to complete 100 units of work. In one day, A can complete 10 units of work. Therefore, A will take 10 days to complete the remaining work (100/10). So, the total number of days taken to complete the work is 2+10 = 12 days. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 12 days. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A can do a work in 7 days B in 12 days and C in 5 days. If they work on it together then in how many days required to complete the work? Answer Choices: (A) 420/177 (B) 420/179 (C) 410/87 (D) 90/14 (E) 77/56\nA: Let's think step by step. We can start by finding the individual rates of work for each person. A can do the work in 7 days, so their rate of work is 1/7. B can do the work in 12 days, so their rate of work is 1/12. C can do the work in 5 days, so their rate of work is 1/5. To find the combined rate of work when they work together, we add up their individual rates of work: 1/7 + 1/12 + 1/5 = 60/420 + 35/420 + 84/420 = 179/420 So when they work together, their combined rate of work is 179/420. To find how long it will take them to complete the work, we can use the formula: time = work / rate The work they need to do is 1 (the whole job), and their combined rate of work is 179/420. time = 1 / (179/420) = 420/179 Therefore, the answer is (B) 420/179. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: 15 men take 20 days of 8 hours each to do a piece of work. How many days of 6 hours each would 21 women take to do the same. If 3 women do as much work as 2 men? Answer Choices: (A) 27.57 (B) 28.57 (C) 29.57 (D) 30.57 (E) 32\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total work done by 15 men in 20 days of 8 hours each. 15 men take 20 days of 8 hours each to do a piece of work. So, the total work done by 15 men = 15 * 20 * 8 = 2400 man-hours. Step 2: Find the work done by 1 man in 1 hour. The work done by 1 man in 1 hour = Total work done by 15 men / (15 * 20) = 2400 / 300 = 8 man-hours. Step 3: Find the work done by 1 woman in 1 hour. 3 women do as much work as 2 men. So, the work done by 1 woman in 1 hour = Work done by 2 men in 1 hour / 3 = 2 * 8 / 3 = 16 / 3 woman-hours. Step 4: Find the total work done by 21 women in x days of 6 hours each. Let the total work done by 21 women in x days of 6 hours each be y woman-hours. So, y = 21 * x * 6 * (16 / 3) = 672x woman-hours. Step 5: Equate the work done by 15 men and 21 women. 2400 man-hours = 672x woman-hours. x = 2400 / (672 * (16 / 3)) = 30.57 days. Therefore, the answer is (D) 30.57. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A can do a piece of work in 30 days. He works at it for 5 days and then B finishes it in 20 days. In what time can A and B together it? Answer Choices: (A) 16 2/3 days (B) 13 1/3 days (C) 17 1/3 days (D) 16 1/2 days (E) 18 1/2 days\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the total work is 1 unit. A can do the work in 30 days, so in 1 day he can do 1/30th of the work. A works for 5 days, so he completes 5/30th of the work, which simplifies to 1/6th of the work. The remaining work is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6th of the work. Now, B finishes the remaining work in 20 days. So, in 1 day, he can do 1/20th of the work. Let's assume that A and B together can do the work in x days. So, in 1 day, A and B together can do 1/xth of the work. We know that A completes 1/6th of the work in 5 days. So, in 1 day, he can do 1/30th of the work. Therefore, the work done by B in 20 days + the work done by A in 5 days = the work done by A and B together in x days. (1/20) * 5/6 + (1/30) * x = 1 Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 100/9 days Rounding off to the nearest integer, we get 11 days. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\n"
