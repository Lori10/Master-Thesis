  "test_question": "Q: The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers? Answer Choices: (A) 47 (B) 91 (C) 41 (D) 67 (E) 44",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: 9, 16, 20, 25, 36,49 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 16 (C) 20 (D) 25 (E) 36\nA: Let's think step by step. The given sequence of numbers is 9, 16, 20, 25, 36, 49. We need to find a pattern or rule that relates these numbers. Looking at the sequence, we can see that each number is a perfect square except for 20. 9 = 3^2 16 = 4^2 20 is not a perfect square 25 = 5^2 36 = 6^2 49 = 7^2 Therefore, the answer is (C) 20. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: which one is odd?\n4377\n3954\n9865\n8454\n9831 Answer Choices: (A) 4377 (B) 3954 (C) 9865 (D) 8454 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. We need to determine which number is odd out of the given options. - 4377: This number ends in 7, which means it is odd. - 3954: This number ends in 4, which means it is even. - 9865: This number ends in 5, which means it is odd. - 8454: This number ends in 4, which means it is even. - 9831: This number ends in 1, which means it is odd. Therefore, the answer is (B) 3954, as it is the only even number among the options. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: How many three-digit whole numbers yield a remainder of 1 when divided by 10 and also yield a remainder of 1 when divided by 6? Answer Choices: (A) None (B) One (C) Two (D) Three (E) Four\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 10. These numbers are of the form 10a + 1, where a is an integer. Next, we need to find the numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 6. These numbers are of the form 6b + 1, where b is an integer. To find the numbers that satisfy both conditions, we need to find the values of a and b that make 10a + 1 and 6b + 1 equal. 10a + 1 = 6b + 1 Simplifying, we get: 10a = 6b Dividing both sides by 2, we get: 5a = 3b This means that a must be a multiple of 3 and b must be a multiple of 5. The smallest three-digit number that satisfies both conditions is 121 (10*12+1). The next number is 181 (10*18+1). Therefore, the answer is (C) Two. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If Q is a positive integer, which of the following must be odd? Answer Choices: (A) Q+1 (B) Q^2+Q (C) Q^2+Q+1 (D) x^2\u22121 (E) 3x^2\u22123\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine which expressions are odd. An odd number is any integer that cannot be divided evenly by 2. (A) Q+1: If Q is odd, then Q+1 is even. If Q is even, then Q+1 is odd. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Q+1 is odd or even. (B) Q^2+Q: We can factor out Q from this expression to get Q(Q+1). Since Q is a positive integer, Q+1 is also a positive integer. Therefore, Q(Q+1) is the product of two consecutive integers, one of which must be even. Therefore, Q(Q+1) is always even. (C) Q^2+Q+1: We can rewrite this expression as (Q+1)^2 - Q. Since (Q+1)^2 is always odd (the square of an odd number is odd), and subtracting an odd number from an odd number results in an even number, Q^2+Q+1 is always odd. (D) x^2-1: We can factor this expression as (x+1)(x-1). Since x is a positive integer, x+1 and x-1 are consecutive integers. One of these must be even, and the other must be odd. Therefore, (x+1)(x-1) is always even. (E) 3x^2-3: We can factor out 3 from this expression to get 3(x^2-1). Since x^2-1 is always even (as shown in option D), 3(x^2-1) is always a multiple of 3, but not necessarily odd. Therefore, the answer is (C) Q^2+Q+1. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
