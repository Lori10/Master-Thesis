  "test_question": "Q: Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other? Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Train A and Train B began traveling towards each other from opposite ends of a 480-mile long track at 1:00 PM. If Train A traveled at 35 miles per hour and Train B traveled at 25 miles per hour, at what time did the trains meet? Answer Choices: (A) 5:40 PM (B) 6:00 PM (C) 7:20 PM (D) 9:00 PM (E) 9:20 PM\nA: Let's think step by step. We can start by using the formula: distance = rate x time. Let's call the time it takes for the trains to meet \"t\". Train A travels at 35 miles per hour, so in time \"t\", it will travel a distance of 35t. Train B travels at 25 miles per hour, so in time \"t\", it will travel a distance of 25t. Since the trains are traveling towards each other, the total distance they will cover is 480 miles. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 35t + 25t = 480 Simplifying: 60t = 480 t = 8 So the trains will meet 8 hours after they started, which would be at 9:00 PM. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 9:00 PM. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: What would happen in the previous question if both A and B had started at point P. Answer Choices: (A) 800 Km (B) 600 Km (C) 1000 Km (D) 350 Km (E) 250 Km\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that A travels at a speed of 50 km/h and B travels at a speed of 40 km/h. If they both started at point P, they would be moving in opposite directions. Let's say they meet after x hours. In that time, A would have traveled 50x km and B would have traveled 40x km. We also know that the distance between A and B is 600 km. So, we can set up the equation: 50x + 40x = 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 90x = 600 x = 6.67 hours Now that we know they meet after 6.67 hours, we can find out how far each of them has traveled: A: 50 km/h x 6.67 h = 333.33 km B: 40 km/h x 6.67 h = 266.67 km The total distance they have traveled is: 333.33 km + 266.67 km = 600 km Therefore, the answer is (B) 600 km. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: The speed of a car increases by 2 kms after every one hour. If the distance travelling in the first one hour was 35 kms. what was the total distance travelled in 12 hours? Answer Choices: (A) 456 kms (B) 482 kms (C) 552 kms (D) 556 kms (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. After the first hour, the car would have travelled 35 + 2 = 37 kms. After the second hour, the car would have travelled 37 + 2 = 39 kms. Similarly, after the third hour, the car would have travelled 41 kms, after the fourth hour, it would have travelled 43 kms, and so on. So, after 12 hours, the car would have travelled a total distance of: 35 + 37 + 39 + ... + 47 + 49 = (12/2) * (35 + 49) = 12 * 42 = 504 kms Therefore, the correct answer is (E) None of these, as none of the given options match the calculated answer. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Two stations A and B are 110 km apart on a straight line. One train starts from A at 7 a.m. and travels towards B at 20 kmph. Another train starts from B at 8 a.m. and travels towards A at a speed of 25 kmph. At what time will they meet? Answer Choices: (A) 39 (B) 10 (C) 88 (D) 12 (E) 18\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much distance the first train covers before the second train starts. The first train starts at 7 a.m. and the second train starts at 8 a.m., which means the first train has a one-hour head start. In one hour, the first train covers a distance of 20 km. Now, let's assume that the two trains meet after t hours. In that case, the second train would have traveled for t - 1 hours. Let's use the formula: distance = speed x time Distance covered by the first train + Distance covered by the second train = Total distance between the two stations 20t + 25(t-1) = 110 Simplifying the equation, we get: 45t = 135 t = 3 Therefore, the two trains will meet after 3 hours. The first train started at 7 a.m., so it will meet the second train at 10 a.m. Hence, the correct answer is (B) 10. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
