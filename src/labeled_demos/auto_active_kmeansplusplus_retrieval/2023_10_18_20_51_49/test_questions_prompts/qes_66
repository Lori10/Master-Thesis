  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In a club with 310 peopl, 138 play tennis, 255 play baseball, and 94 people play both sports. How many people do not pla a sport? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 8 (C) 4 (D) 10 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 138 people play tennis, 255 people play baseball, and 94 people play both sports. To find the number of people who play only tennis, we can subtract the number of people who play both sports from the number of people who play tennis: 138 - 94 = 44 Similarly, to find the number of people who play only baseball, we can subtract the number of people who play both sports from the number of people who play baseball: 255 - 94 = 161 Now, to find the number of people who do not play a sport, we need to subtract the total number of people who play a sport from the total number of people in the club: 310 - (44 + 161 + 94) = 11 Therefore, the answer is (E) 11. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In final exam of class IX there are 50 students 10 % students failed. How many students passed to class X? Answer Choices: (A) 33 (B) 378 (C) 37 (D) 39 (E) 45\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of students who failed the exam. 10% of 50 = (10/100) x 50 = 5 Step 2: Find the number of students who passed the exam. Total number of students - Number of students who failed = 50 - 5 = 45 Therefore, the answer is (E) 45. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: There are 600 boys in a hostel. Each plays either hockey or football or both. If 75% play hockey and 45% play football, how many play both? Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 150 (C) 200 (D) 180 (E) 160\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 75% of the boys play hockey, which means 0.75 x 600 = 450 boys play hockey. Similarly, 45% of the boys play football, which means 0.45 x 600 = 270 boys play football. Now, we need to find out how many boys play both hockey and football. Let's assume that x boys play both. We know that the total number of boys who play either hockey or football is 600. So, we can write an equation: Number of boys who play hockey + Number of boys who play football - Number of boys who play both = Total number of boys 450 + 270 - x = 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 720 - x = 600 x = 120 Therefore, 120 boys play both hockey and football. The correct answer is (A) 120. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: In a class of 25 students in an examination in maths 3 students scored 95 marks each, 5 get zero each and the average of the rest was 45. What is the average of the whole class? Answer Choices: (A) A) 47 (B) B) 45.6 (C) C) 42 (D) D) 48 (E) E) 49\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total marks obtained by the class. Total marks obtained by the class = (3 students * 95 marks each) + (5 students * 0 marks each) + (17 students * 45 marks each) = 285 + 0 + 765 = 1050 Now, we can find the average of the whole class by dividing the total marks obtained by the number of students. Average of the whole class = Total marks obtained by the class / Number of students = 1050 / 25 = 42 Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 42. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
