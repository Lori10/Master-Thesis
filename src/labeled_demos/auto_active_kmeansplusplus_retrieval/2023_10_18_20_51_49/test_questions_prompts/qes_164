  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In a class, 30% of the students speaks truth, 20% speaks lie and 10% speaks both. If a student is selected at random, what is the probability that he has speak truth or lie? Answer Choices: (A) 1/4 (B) 2/3 (C) 3/5 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the percentage of students who speak either truth or lie. Percentage of students who speak truth = 30% Percentage of students who speak lie = 20% However, we need to subtract the percentage of students who speak both truth and lie, as they have been counted twice. Percentage of students who speak both truth and lie = 10% Therefore, the percentage of students who speak either truth or lie = 30% + 20% - 10% = 40%. So, the probability that a student selected at random speaks truth or lie is 40%. Answer: None of the above (as none of the answer choices match 40%). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: In a club with 310 peopl, 138 play tennis, 255 play baseball, and 94 people play both sports. How many people do not pla a sport? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 8 (C) 4 (D) 10 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 138 people play tennis, 255 people play baseball, and 94 people play both sports. To find the number of people who play only tennis, we can subtract the number of people who play both sports from the number of people who play tennis: 138 - 94 = 44 Similarly, to find the number of people who play only baseball, we can subtract the number of people who play both sports from the number of people who play baseball: 255 - 94 = 161 Now, to find the number of people who do not play a sport, we need to subtract the total number of people who play a sport from the total number of people in the club: 310 - (44 + 161 + 94) = 11 Therefore, the answer is (E) 11. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: 15 chess players take part in a tournament. Every player plays twice with each of his opponents. How many games are to be played? Answer Choices: (A) 190 (B) 200 (C) 210 (D) 220 (E) 225\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 15 players in the tournament. Each player plays twice with every other player. So, the number of games played by each player is 14 (since they don't play against themselves). Therefore, the total number of games played in the tournament is: 15 players x 14 games each = 210 games So, the correct answer is (C) 210. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In final exam of class IX there are 50 students 10 % students failed. How many students passed to class X? Answer Choices: (A) 33 (B) 378 (C) 37 (D) 39 (E) 45\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of students who failed the exam. 10% of 50 = (10/100) x 50 = 5 Step 2: Find the number of students who passed the exam. Total number of students - Number of students who failed = 50 - 5 = 45 Therefore, the answer is (E) 45. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
