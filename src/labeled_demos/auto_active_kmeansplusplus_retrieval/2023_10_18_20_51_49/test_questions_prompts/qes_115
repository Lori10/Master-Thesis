  "formatted_prompt": "Q: City X has a population 5 times as great as the population of City Y, which has a population twice as great as the population of City Z. What is the ratio of the population of City X to the population of City Z? Answer Choices: (A) 1:8 (B) 1:4 (C) 2:1 (D) 4:1 (E) 10:1\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the population of City Z is \"x\". According to the problem, the population of City Y is twice as great as City Z, so the population of City Y is 2x. Similarly, the population of City X is 5 times as great as City Y, so the population of City X is 5(2x) = 10x. Therefore, the ratio of the population of City X to the population of City Z is: 10x : x Simplifying this ratio, we get: 10 : 1 So the answer is (E) 10:1. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: 10% of the inhabitants of a village having died of cholera, a panic set in, during which 25% of the remaining inhabitants left the village. The population is then reduced to 4050. Find the number of original inhabitants. Answer Choices: (A) 5000 (B) 6000 (C) 7000 (D) 8000 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Let the original number of inhabitants be x. Step 2: 10% of the inhabitants died of cholera, so the number of remaining inhabitants is 0.9x. Step 3: During the panic, 25% of the remaining inhabitants left, so the number of remaining inhabitants is 0.75(0.9x) = 0.675x. Step 4: We know that the current population is 4050, so we can set up an equation: 0.675x = 4050. Step 5: Solving for x, we get x = 6000. Therefore, the number of original inhabitants was 6000. The answer is (B) 6000. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: At a contest with 2,500 participants, 1/2 of the people are aged 10 to 12. Next year, the number of people aged 10 to 12 will increase by 1/5. After this change, what percentage of the total 2,500 people will the 10- to 12-year-olds represent? Answer Choices: (A) 55% (B) 60% (C) 50% (D) 45% (E) 66%\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 at the contest. 1/2 of 2,500 = 1,250 people aged 10 to 12. Step 2: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1/5 of 1,250 = 250 people increase. 1,250 + 250 = 1,500 people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. Step 3: Find the percentage of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1,500/2,500 x 100% = 60% Therefore, the answer is (B) 60%. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Look at this series: 1.5, 2.3, 3.1, 3.9, ... What number should come next? Answer Choices: (A) 4.2 (B) 4.4 (C) 4.7 (D) 5.1 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. The pattern seems to be that each number is increasing by 0.8. Starting with 1.5, we add 0.8 to get 2.3. Then we add 0.8 again to get 3.1, and so on. Therefore, the next number in the series should be 4.7. So the answer is (C) 4.7. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
