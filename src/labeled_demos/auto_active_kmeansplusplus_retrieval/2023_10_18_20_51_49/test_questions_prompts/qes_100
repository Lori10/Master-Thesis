  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In a class of 25 students in an examination in maths 3 students scored 95 marks each, 5 get zero each and the average of the rest was 45. What is the average of the whole class? Answer Choices: (A) A) 47 (B) B) 45.6 (C) C) 42 (D) D) 48 (E) E) 49\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total marks obtained by the class. Total marks obtained by the class = (3 students * 95 marks each) + (5 students * 0 marks each) + (17 students * 45 marks each) = 285 + 0 + 765 = 1050 Now, we can find the average of the whole class by dividing the total marks obtained by the number of students. Average of the whole class = Total marks obtained by the class / Number of students = 1050 / 25 = 42 Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 42. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In final exam of class IX there are 50 students 10 % students failed. How many students passed to class X? Answer Choices: (A) 33 (B) 378 (C) 37 (D) 39 (E) 45\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of students who failed the exam. 10% of 50 = (10/100) x 50 = 5 Step 2: Find the number of students who passed the exam. Total number of students - Number of students who failed = 50 - 5 = 45 Therefore, the answer is (E) 45. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In the third grade of Windblown School there are 96 students, one third of them failed the math test and 1/6 failed that literature test. At least how many students failed both tests? Answer Choices: (A) 0. (B) 6. (C) 8. (D) 10. (E) 12.\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of students who failed the math test. One third of the 96 students failed the math test, so: 1/3 x 96 = 32 Therefore, 32 students failed the math test. Step 2: Find the number of students who failed the literature test. 1/6 of the 96 students failed the literature test, so: 1/6 x 96 = 16 Therefore, 16 students failed the literature test. Step 3: Find the number of students who failed both tests. We don't know the exact number of students who failed both tests, but we do know that it must be less than or equal to the smaller of the two numbers we just found (i.e. 16). Therefore, the answer is (B) 6, because that is the only option that is less than or equal to 16. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A student has to obtain 33% of the total marks to pass. He got 59 marks and failed by 40 marks. The maximum marks are? Answer Choices: (A) 450 (B) 300 (C) 500 (D) 610 (E) 175\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the maximum marks be x. The student got 59 marks and failed by 40 marks, which means he needed 33% of the total marks to pass. 33% of x can be written as 0.33x. So, we can set up the equation: 0.33x = 59 + 40 0.33x = 99 x = 99/0.33 x = 300 Therefore, the maximum marks are 300. The correct answer is (B) 300. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
