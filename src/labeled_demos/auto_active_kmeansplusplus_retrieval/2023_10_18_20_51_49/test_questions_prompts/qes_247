  "test_question": "Q: A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. What is the perimeter of the piece? Answer Choices: (A) 60 m (B) 61 m (C) 62 m (D) 63 m (E) 64 m",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: What is the perimeter, in meters, of a rectangular garden 24 meters wide that has the same area as a rectangular playground 16 meters long and 12 meters wide? Answer Choices: (A) 48 (B) 56 (C) 64 (D) 76 (E) 192\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the area of the playground: Area = length x width = 16 x 12 = 192 square meters Since the garden has the same area, its length must be: Length = Area / width = 192 / 24 = 8 meters Now we can calculate the perimeter of the garden: Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 2(8 + 24) = 2(32) = 64 meters Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 64. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A rectangular plot measuring 90 metres by 50 metres is to be enclosed by wire fencing. If the poles of the fence are kept 5 metres apart, how many poles will be needed ? Answer Choices: (A) 55 (B) 56 (C) 57 (D) 58 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular plot. Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 2(90 + 50) = 280 meters Next, we need to find the number of poles required if they are kept 5 meters apart. We can divide the perimeter by the distance between two poles: Number of poles = Perimeter / Distance between two poles Number of poles = 280 / 5 = 56 Therefore, the answer is (B) 56. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A man cycles round the boundary of a rectangular park at the rate of 12 kmph and completes one full round in 8 minutes. If the ratio between the length and breadth of the park be 3:2, then its area is: Answer Choices: (A) 1536m2 (B) 15360m2 (C) 153600m2 (D) 163600m2 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular park. Let the length and breadth of the park be 3x and 2x respectively (as given in the ratio 3:2). Perimeter of the park = 2(Length + Breadth) = 2(3x + 2x) = 10x Now, we know that the man cycles round the park at the rate of 12 kmph. In 1 hour, he covers a distance of 12 km. In 1 minute, he covers a distance of 12/60 = 0.2 km = 200 m. In 8 minutes, he covers a distance of 200 x 8 = 1600 m = 1.6 km. We also know that in 8 minutes, he completes one full round of the park. Therefore, 10x = 1.6 km x = 160 m Length of the park = 3x = 480 m Breadth of the park = 2x = 320 m Area of the park = Length x Breadth = 480 x 320 = 153600 m\u00b2 Hence, the correct answer is (C) 153600m\u00b2. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The length of a rectangular plot is 20 metres more than its breadth. If the cost of fencing the plot @ Rs. 26.50 per metre is Rs. 7420, what is the length of the plot in metres? Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 200 (C) 300 (D) 400 (E) 80\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the breadth of the rectangular plot be x metres. Then, the length of the plot is (x+20) metres. The cost of fencing the plot is Rs. 26.50 per metre. Therefore, the total cost of fencing the rectangular plot is: Perimeter of the plot x Cost per metre = (2 x length + 2 x breadth) x 26.50 Substituting the values of length and breadth, we get: (2(x+20) + 2x) x 26.50 = 7420 Simplifying the equation, we get: 6.5x + 530 = 371 6.5x = 371 - 530 6.5x = -159 x = -24.46 Since the breadth cannot be negative, this answer is not possible. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
