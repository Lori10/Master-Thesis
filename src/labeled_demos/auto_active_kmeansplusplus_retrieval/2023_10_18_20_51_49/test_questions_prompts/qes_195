  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Five drainage pipes, each draining water from a pool at the same constant rate, together can drain a certain pool in 12 days. How many additional pipes, each draining water at the same constant rate, will be needed to drain the pool in 6 days? Answer Choices: (A)  5 (B)  9 (C)  10 (D)  12 (E)  15\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to understand that the rate of draining water is constant for each pipe. Let's say the rate of each pipe is x. We know that 5 pipes can drain the pool in 12 days. So, the total amount of water in the pool is 5x * 12 = 60x. Now, we want to drain the same pool in half the time, which is 6 days. So, the total amount of water drained should be the same, which is 60x. Let's say we need n additional pipes to drain the pool in 6 days. So, the total number of pipes will be 5 + n. We can use the formula: total amount of water drained = rate * time 60x = (5 + n) * x * 6 Simplifying this equation, we get: 60x = 30x + 6nx 30x = 6nx n = 5 Therefore, we need 5 additional pipes to drain the pool in 6 days. The answer is (A) 5. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Two taps can separately fill a cistern 10 minutes and 15 minutes respectively and when the waste pipe is open, they can together fill it in 18 minutes. The waste pipe can empty the full cistern in? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 6 (C) 7 (D) 9 (E) 1\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the capacity of the cistern be C. The rate of filling of the first tap is C/10 per minute. The rate of filling of the second tap is C/15 per minute. When both taps are open, their combined rate of filling is C/18 per minute. Let the rate of emptying of the waste pipe be W (in terms of the capacity of the cistern per minute). According to the problem, when all three are open, the net rate of filling is zero (since the waste pipe is emptying the cistern at the same time). So, we can write the equation: C/10 + C/15 - C/18 = W Multiplying through by the LCM of the denominators (which is 90), we get: 9C + 6C - 5C = 90W Simplifying, we get: 10C = 90W Dividing by 10, we get: C = 9W This means that the waste pipe can empty the full cistern in 9 minutes (since it empties 1/9th of the cistern per minute). Therefore, the answer is (D) 9. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Pipe A can fill a tank in 60 min . There is a second pipe in the bottom of the cistern to empty it. If all the two pipes are simultaneously opened, then the cistern is full in 180 min. In how much time, the second pipe alone can empty the cistern? Answer Choices: (A) 60 min (B) 45 min (C) 90 min (D) 70 min (E) 30 min\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the second pipe can empty the cistern in x minutes. In 1 minute, pipe A can fill 1/60th of the tank. In 1 minute, the second pipe can empty 1/xth of the tank. When both pipes are opened together, they fill 1/60th - 1/xth of the tank in 1 minute. According to the problem, both pipes together fill the tank in 180 minutes. So, we can write: 1/60 - 1/x = 1/180 Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 90 Therefore, the second pipe alone can empty the cistern in 90 minutes. The correct answer is (C) 90 min. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Pipe A can fill the tank in 50 minutes and pipe B in 40min and pipe C can empty the tank in 2 hours. How long it will take to fill the tank if three of the pipes are operating together? Answer Choices: (A) 22.22 (B) 27.27 (C) 29.35 (D) 31.2 (E) 35.6\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the combined rate of filling of pipes A and B. Pipe A can fill the tank in 50 minutes, so its rate of filling is 1/50 of the tank per minute. Pipe B can fill the tank in 40 minutes, so its rate of filling is 1/40 of the tank per minute. Together, pipes A and B can fill the tank at a rate of (1/50 + 1/40) = 3/200 of the tank per minute. Now, we need to find the rate of emptying of pipe C. Pipe C can empty the tank in 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. So, its rate of emptying is 1/120 of the tank per minute. When all three pipes are operating together, the net rate of filling of the tank is the sum of the rates of filling of pipes A and B, minus the rate of emptying of pipe C. So, the net rate of filling of the tank is (3/200 - 1/120) = 1/300 of the tank per minute. To fill the entire tank, we need to do 1 job, which is filling the tank. Let's assume that it takes 'x' minutes to fill the tank when all three pipes are operating together. So, the equation becomes: 1/x = 1/300 Solving for x, we get: x = 300 minutes Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
