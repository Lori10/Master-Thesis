  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The length of a rectangular floor is more than its breadth by 200%. If Rs.441 is required to paint the floor at the rate of Rs.3/sq m, what would be the length of the floor? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 18 (C) 20 (D) 21 (E) 24\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the breadth of the rectangular floor to be x meters. According to the question, the length of the floor is more than its breadth by 200%, which means the length is equal to x + 2x = 3x meters. The area of the rectangular floor is given by length x breadth, which is 3x * x = 3x^2 square meters. We know that the cost of painting 1 square meter of the floor is Rs.3. Therefore, the cost of painting 3x^2 square meters of the floor is 3 * 3x^2 = 9x^2 rupees. We are given that the cost of painting the floor is Rs.441. Therefore, 9x^2 = 441 Solving for x, we get x = 7. Therefore, the length of the floor is 3x = 3 * 7 = 21 meters. Hence, the answer is (D) 21. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A rectangular lawn of dimensions 80 m * 60 m has two roads each 10 m wide running in the middle of the lawn, one parallel to the length and the other parallel to the breadth. What is the cost of traveling the two roads at Rs.3 per sq m? Answer Choices: (A) 3929 (B) 3998 (C) 3128 (D) 3900 (E) 3920\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the area of the lawn. Area of the lawn = length * breadth = 80 * 60 = 4800 sq m Next, we need to calculate the area of the two roads. Area of road parallel to length = length of road * breadth of lawn = 10 * 60 = 600 sq m Area of road parallel to breadth = length of road * breadth of lawn = 10 * 80 = 800 sq m Total area of the two roads = 600 + 800 = 1400 sq m Now, we need to calculate the cost of traveling the two roads at Rs.3 per sq m. Cost of traveling the two roads = Total area of the two roads * cost per sq m = 1400 * 3 = 4200 None of the answer choices match the calculated answer, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A rectangular grass field is 60 m * 55 m, it has a path of 2.5 m wide all round it on the outside. Find the area of the path and the cost of constructing it at Rs.2 per sq m? Answer Choices: (A) 1350 (B) 1200 (C) 9676 (D) 1679 (E) 2691\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the area of the grass field without the path. Area of grass field = length * width = 60m * 55m = 3300 sq m Now, we need to find the area of the path. The path is 2.5m wide on all sides, so the length and width of the path will be: Length of path = length of grass field + 2 * width of path = 60m + 2 * 2.5m = 65m Width of path = width of grass field + 2 * width of path = 55m + 2 * 2.5m = 60m Area of path = length of path * width of path - area of grass field Area of path = 65m * 60m - 3300 sq m = 2700 sq m Finally, we need to find the cost of constructing the path at Rs.2 per sq m. Cost of constructing path = area of path * cost per sq m Cost of constructing path = 2700 sq m * Rs.2/sq m = Rs.5400 Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the calculated answer of Rs.5400. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The length of a rectangular plot is 20 metres more than its breadth. If the cost of fencing the plot @ Rs. 26.50 per metre is Rs. 7420, what is the length of the plot in metres? Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 200 (C) 300 (D) 400 (E) 80\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the breadth of the rectangular plot be x metres. Then, the length of the plot is (x+20) metres. The cost of fencing the plot is Rs. 26.50 per metre. Therefore, the total cost of fencing the rectangular plot is: Perimeter of the plot x Cost per metre = (2 x length + 2 x breadth) x 26.50 Substituting the values of length and breadth, we get: (2(x+20) + 2x) x 26.50 = 7420 Simplifying the equation, we get: 6.5x + 530 = 371 6.5x = 371 - 530 6.5x = -159 x = -24.46 Since the breadth cannot be negative, this answer is not possible. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
