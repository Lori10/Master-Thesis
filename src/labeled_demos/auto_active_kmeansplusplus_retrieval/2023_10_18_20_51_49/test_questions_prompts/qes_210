  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If money is invested at r percent interest, compounded annually, the amount of the investment will double in approximately 50/r years. If Luke's parents invested $15,500 in a long term bond that pays 12 percent interest compounded annually, what will be the approximate total amount of the investment 12 years later, when Luke is ready for college? Answer Choices: (A) 62,000 (B) 85,500 (C) 95,500 (D) 100,500 (E) 120,000\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many times the investment will double in 12 years. Using the formula given in the problem, we can calculate that the investment will double approximately every 4.17 years (50/12). Therefore, the investment will double approximately 2.88 times (12/4.17). Next, we need to calculate the final amount of the investment after 12 years. To do this, we can use the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) Where: A = final amount P = principal (initial investment) r = annual interest rate (as a decimal) n = number of times interest is compounded per year t = time (in years) Plugging in the given values, we get: A = 15500(1 + 0.12/1)^(1*12) A = 15500(1.12)^12 A \u2248 55,500 Finally, we need to multiply this amount by the number of times the investment doubled: 55,500 * 2.88 \u2248 159,840 Therefore, the approximate total amount of the investment 12 years later is $159,840. None of the answer choices provided match this result. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: If money is invested at r percent interest, compounded annually, the amount of investment will double in approximately 70/r years. If Pat's parents invested $ 5000 in a long term bond that pays 8 percent interest, compounded annually, what will be the approximate total amount of investment 18 years later, when Pat is ready for college? Answer Choices: (A) $20000 (B) $15000 (C) $12000 (D) $10000 (E) $9000\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of times the investment will double in 18 years. Since the investment doubles in approximately 70/r years, and r is 8%, the investment will double in approximately 70/8 = 8.75 years. Therefore, the investment will double approximately 18/8.75 = 2.06 times. Step 2: Calculate the total amount of investment after 18 years. Since the investment doubles 2.06 times, the total amount of investment after 18 years will be $5000 x 2.06 x 2.06 = $21412.50 (rounded to the nearest cent). Therefore, the correct answer is (None of the above). The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Mike invested Rs. 3750 in a scheme for 3 years at compound interest rate 6.5% p.a. How much amount will Mike get on maturity of the fixed deposit? Answer Choices: (A) s.4581.29 (B) s.4450 (C) s.4500 (D) s.4500.25 (E) s.4529.81\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the formula for compound interest to solve this problem: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) Where: A = the amount at the end of the investment P = the principal amount (initial investment) r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal) n = the number of times the interest is compounded per year t = the time period of the investment (in years) Plugging in the given values, we get: A = 3750(1 + 0.065/1)^(1*3) A = 3750(1.065)^3 A = 3750(1.207) A = 4522.50 Therefore, the closest answer choice is (E) s.4529.81. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Find the amount on Rs.8000 in 9 months at 20% per annum, if the interest being compounded quarterly? Answer Choices: (A) 2888 (B) 2690 (C) 2668 (D) 9261 (E) 2312\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve the problem step by step. Given, Principal (P) = Rs. 8000, Rate of interest (R) = 20% per annum, Time (t) = 9 months and interest is compounded quarterly. First, we need to calculate the interest rate per quarter. Rate of interest per quarter (r) = R/4 = 20/4 = 5% Now, we can use the formula for compound interest: Amount (A) = P(1 + r/100)^(n) where n is the number of quarters. n = (9 months)/3 months per quarter = 3 quarters Substituting the values, we get: A = 8000(1 + 5/100)^(3) = 8000(21/20)^3 A = 8000(9261/8000) = Rs. 9261 Therefore, the correct answer is option (D) 9261. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
