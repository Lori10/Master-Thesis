  "test_question": "Q: Three friends Alan, Roger and Peter attempt to answer a question on an exam. Alan randomly guesses the answer, giving him a 1/5 probability of guessing correctly. Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, giving him a 2/3 probability of answering correctly. And Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer. What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating? Answer Choices: (A) 1/18 (B) 1/9 (C) 23/90 (D) 5/18 (E) 13/45",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Peter rolls two dice at the same time. What is the probability that the total sum of numbers on the dices is 3? Answer Choices: (A) a)  1/12 (B) b)  1/36 (C) c)  1/6 (D) d)  1/18 (E) e)  1/3\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice, as each die has 6 possible outcomes. To get a sum of 3, the only possible outcomes are (1,2) and (2,1). Therefore, there are only 2 favorable outcomes out of 36 possible outcomes. So, the probability of getting a sum of 3 is 2/36, which simplifies to 1/18. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) d) 1/18. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A student must answer 7 out of 10 questions on an examination. If at least 3 of the first 5 questions must be answered, how many possible combinations of 7 questions are available to the student?\n. Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 80 (C) 110 (D) 220 (E) 360\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that the student must answer 7 out of 10 questions, so we need to find the number of ways to choose 7 questions out of 10. This can be calculated using the combination formula: 10C7 = 10! / (7! * 3!) = 120 So there are 120 possible combinations of 7 questions. Step 2: We also know that at least 3 of the first 5 questions must be answered. This means that the student can either answer 3, 4, or 5 questions from the first 5. Step 3: We need to find the number of ways to choose the remaining questions from the remaining 5. This can be calculated using the combination formula: 5C4 + 5C3 + 5C2 = 5! / (4! * 1!) + 5! / (3! * 2!) + 5! / (2! * 3!) = 5 + 10 + 10 = 25 So there are 25 ways to choose the remaining questions. Step 4: We can now find the total number of possible combinations by multiplying the results from step 2 and step 3: (3C3 * 5C4) + (4C3 * 5C3) + (5C3 * 5C2) = (1 * 5) + (4 * 10) + (10 * 10) = 5 + 40 + 100 = 145 Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the correct answer of 145. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In an entrance exam, 3 marks is awarded for every correct answer and (-1) for every wrong answer. If a student gets 38 marks after attempting all questions, find the number of questions answered correctly if the total questions were 70. Answer Choices: (A) 38 (B) 40 (C) 27 (D) 43 (E) 56\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the number of questions answered correctly is x. Then the number of questions answered incorrectly would be (70-x). Now, we can use the given information to form an equation: 3x - 1(70-x) = 38 Simplifying this equation: 3x - 70 + x = 38 4x = 108 x = 27 Therefore, the student answered 27 questions correctly. The correct answer is (C) 27. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In a class, 30% of the students speaks truth, 20% speaks lie and 10% speaks both. If a student is selected at random, what is the probability that he has speak truth or lie? Answer Choices: (A) 1/4 (B) 2/3 (C) 3/5 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the percentage of students who speak either truth or lie. Percentage of students who speak truth = 30% Percentage of students who speak lie = 20% However, we need to subtract the percentage of students who speak both truth and lie, as they have been counted twice. Percentage of students who speak both truth and lie = 10% Therefore, the percentage of students who speak either truth or lie = 30% + 20% - 10% = 40%. So, the probability that a student selected at random speaks truth or lie is 40%. Answer: None of the above (as none of the answer choices match 40%). The answer is A.\n\n\n"
