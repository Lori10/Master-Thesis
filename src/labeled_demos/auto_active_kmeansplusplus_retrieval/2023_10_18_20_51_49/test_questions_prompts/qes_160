  "test_question": "Q: John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening. In a 50% strong milk tea, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk.\nWhat is the final concentration of tea John drinks? Answer Choices: (A) 15.38% (B) 42% (C) 39.86% (D) 22.35% (E) 32.51%",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A jar full of whisky contains 40% alcohol. A part of this whisky is replaced by another containg 19% alcohol and now the percentage of alcohol was found to be 22%. What quantity of whisky is replaced ? Answer Choices: (A) 1/3 (B) 2/3 (C) 2/5 (D) 3/5 (E) 4/5\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the jar initially contains 100 units of whisky. Out of these 100 units, 40 units are alcohol. Let's say x units of whisky are replaced with the new whisky containing 19% alcohol. So, the amount of alcohol in the new mixture will be: 40 - 0.4x (alcohol in the original mixture) + 0.19x (alcohol in the new mixture) The total amount of whisky in the new mixture will be: 100 - x (original amount) + x (new amount) Now, we are given that the percentage of alcohol in the new mixture is 22%. So, we can set up the equation: (40 - 0.4x + 0.19x)/(100) = 0.22 Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 2/5 Therefore, 2/5 of the original amount of whisky is replaced with the new whisky containing 19% alcohol. So, the answer is (C) 2/5. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: How many kilograms of tea powder costing Rs. 31 per kg be mixed with 36 kilograms of tea powder costing Rs. 43 per kg, such that the mixture when sold at Rs. 44 per kg gives profit of 10%? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 15 (C) 20 (D) 10 (E) 30\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve the problem step by step. Let the required quantity of tea powder costing Rs. 31 per kg be x kg. The cost of 36 kg of tea powder costing Rs. 43 per kg is 36 x 43 = Rs. 1548. To make a profit of 10%, the selling price of the mixture per kg should be 1.1 times the cost price per kg. Therefore, the selling price of the mixture per kg is Rs. 1.1 x 44 = Rs. 48.4. The total cost of the mixture is the sum of the cost of the two types of tea powder. So, 31x + 1548 = (x + 36) x 44 Solving this equation, we get x = 20. Therefore, 20 kg of tea powder costing Rs. 31 per kg should be mixed with 36 kg of tea powder costing Rs. 43 per kg to get a mixture that can be sold at Rs. 44 per kg with a profit of 10%. Hence, the answer is (C) 20. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: By weight, liquid X makes up 0.5 percent of solution P and 1.5 percent of solution Q. If 200 grams of solution P are mixed with 800 grams of solution Q, then liquid X accounts for what percent of the weight of the resulting solution? Answer Choices: (A) 1.3% (B) 1.2% (C) 1.1% (D) 1.0% (E) 0.9%\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much liquid X is in 200 grams of solution P and 800 grams of solution Q. Liquid X in 200 grams of solution P = 0.5% of 200 grams = 1 gram Liquid X in 800 grams of solution Q = 1.5% of 800 grams = 12 grams Total liquid X in the resulting solution = 1 gram + 12 grams = 13 grams Now, we need to find out what percent of the weight of the resulting solution is 13 grams. Total weight of resulting solution = 200 grams + 800 grams = 1000 grams Percent of liquid X in the resulting solution = (13 grams / 1000 grams) x 100% = 1.3% Therefore, the answer is (A) 1.3%. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Salad dressing P is made up of 30% vinegar and 70% oil, and salad dressing Q contains 10% vinegar and 90% oil. If the two dressings are combined to produce a salad dressing that is 12% vinegar, dressing P comprises what percentage of the new dressing? Answer Choices: (A) 50% (B) 40% (C) 30% (D) 20% (E) 10%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that we have 100 ml of the new salad dressing. Let x be the percentage of dressing P in the new dressing. Then, we can write: - The amount of vinegar in dressing P = 30% of x ml - The amount of vinegar in dressing Q = 10% of (100 - x) ml (since the total amount of dressing is 100 ml and we have x ml of dressing P) - The amount of vinegar in the new dressing = 12% of 100 ml = 12 ml Since we are combining the two dressings, the total amount of vinegar in the new dressing is the sum of the amount of vinegar in dressing P and dressing Q. So, we can write: 0.3x + 0.1(100 - x) = 12 Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.2x + 10 = 12 0.2x = 2 x = 10 Therefore, dressing P comprises 10% of the new dressing. The correct answer is (E) 10%. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
