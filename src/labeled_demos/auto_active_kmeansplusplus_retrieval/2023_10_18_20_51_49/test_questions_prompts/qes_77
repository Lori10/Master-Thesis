Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 18 (C) 99 (D) 787 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total cost of all the books Rahim bought. Total cost = Rs.1150 + Rs.920 = Rs.2070 Next, we need to find the total number of books Rahim bought. Total number of books = 65 + 50 = 115 Finally, we can find the average price per book by dividing the total cost by the total number of books. Average price per book = Total cost / Total number of books Average price per book = Rs.2070 / 115 Average price per book = Rs.18 Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 18. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A and B invests Rs.8000 and Rs.9000 in a business. After 4 months, A withdraws half of his capital and 2 months later, B withdraws one-third of his capital. In what ratio should they share the profits at the end of the year? Answer Choices: (A) 32:45 (B) 32:37 (C) 32:41 (D) 32:47 (E) 32:48\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. Let the total profit be x. A invests Rs.8000 and B invests Rs.9000. After 4 months, A withdraws half of his capital, which means he withdraws Rs.4000. So, A's investment for the remaining 8 months is Rs.4000. B does not withdraw any amount after 4 months. After 6 months (2 months after A's withdrawal), B withdraws one-third of his capital, which means he withdraws Rs.3000. So, B's investment for the remaining 6 months is Rs.6000. Now, let's calculate the ratio of their investments for the entire year. A's investment for the year = (4/12)*8000 + (8/12)*4000 = 2667 + 2667 = 5334 B's investment for the year = (6/12)*9000 + (6/12)*6000 = 4500 + 3000 = 7500 Therefore, the ratio of their investments for the entire year is 5334:7500, which simplifies to 32:45. Hence, the answer is (A) 32:45. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
