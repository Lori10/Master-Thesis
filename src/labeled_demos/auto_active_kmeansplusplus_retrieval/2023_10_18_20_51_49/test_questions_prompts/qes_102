  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In how many ways can a group of 3 men and 3 women be made out of a total of 7 men and 4 women? Answer Choices: (A) 163 (B) 167 (C) 130 (D) 174 (E) 180\nA: Let's think step by step. We need to select 3 men out of 7 men and 3 women out of 4 women. The number of ways to select 3 men out of 7 men is 7C3 = (7*6*5)/(3*2*1) = 35. The number of ways to select 3 women out of 4 women is 4C3 = (4*3*2)/(3*2*1) = 4. The total number of ways to select 3 men and 3 women out of 7 men and 4 women is the product of the above two values, i.e., 35*4 = 140. Therefore, the correct answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the calculated value of 140. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A, B and C rent a pasture. A puts 10 oxen for 7 months, B puts 12 oxen for 5 months and C puts 15 oxen for 3 months for grazing. If the rent of the pasture is Rs. 245, how much must C pay as his share of rent? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 50 (C) 55 (D) 63 (E) none\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of oxen-months contributed by all three people. A contributed 10 oxen for 7 months, so that's 10 x 7 = 70 oxen-months. B contributed 12 oxen for 5 months, so that's 12 x 5 = 60 oxen-months. C contributed 15 oxen for 3 months, so that's 15 x 3 = 45 oxen-months. The total number of oxen-months is 70 + 60 + 45 = 175. Now we need to find out what fraction of the total rent C should pay. C contributed 45 oxen-months out of a total of 175, which is 45/175. To find out how much C should pay, we need to multiply this fraction by the total rent: (45/175) x 245 = 63 So C should pay Rs. 63 as his share of the rent. The correct answer is (D) 63. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: What are the number of ways to select 3 men and 2 women such that one man and one woman are always selected? Answer Choices: (A) 26 ways (B) 19 ways (C) 30 ways (D) 76 ways (E) 15 ways\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to select one man from the available men, which can be done in C(3,1) ways. Then, we need to select one woman from the available women, which can be done in C(2,1) ways. Next, we need to select the remaining 1 man and 1 woman from the remaining pool of men and women. This can be done in C(2,1) * C(1,1) ways. Therefore, the total number of ways to select 3 men and 2 women such that one man and one woman are always selected is: C(3,1) * C(2,1) * C(2,1) * C(1,1) = 3 * 2 * 2 * 1 = 12 ways None of the answer choices match the correct answer of 12 ways. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Calculate how many men are needed to finish a specific task in 5 days if it will take 15 men to complete the same task in 10 days. ? Answer Choices: (A) 13 (B) 16 (C) 35 (D) 25 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the formula: (number of men) x (number of days) = (amount of work) Let's call the number of men needed to finish the task in 5 days \"x\". So we have: x * 5 = 15 * 10 Simplifying: x = 30 Therefore, 30 men are needed to finish the task in 5 days. Answer: None of the above (not one of the answer choices is 30). The answer is A.\n\n\n"
