After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Train A and Train B began traveling towards each other from opposite ends of a 480-mile long track at 1:00 PM. If Train A traveled at 35 miles per hour and Train B traveled at 25 miles per hour, at what time did the trains meet? Answer Choices: (A) 5:40 PM (B) 6:00 PM (C) 7:20 PM (D) 9:00 PM (E) 9:20 PM\nA: Let's think step by step. We can start by using the formula: distance = rate x time. Let's call the time it takes for the trains to meet \"t\". Train A travels at 35 miles per hour, so in time \"t\", it will travel a distance of 35t. Train B travels at 25 miles per hour, so in time \"t\", it will travel a distance of 25t. Since the trains are traveling towards each other, the total distance they will cover is 480 miles. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 35t + 25t = 480 Simplifying: 60t = 480 t = 8 So the trains will meet 8 hours after they started, which would be at 9:00 PM. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 9:00 PM. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Two stations A and B are 110 km apart on a straight line. One train starts from A at 7 a.m. and travels towards B at 20 kmph. Another train starts from B at 8 a.m. and travels towards A at a speed of 25 kmph. At what time will they meet? Answer Choices: (A) 39 (B) 10 (C) 88 (D) 12 (E) 18\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much distance the first train covers before the second train starts. The first train starts at 7 a.m. and the second train starts at 8 a.m., which means the first train has a one-hour head start. In one hour, the first train covers a distance of 20 km. Now, let's assume that the two trains meet after t hours. In that case, the second train would have traveled for t - 1 hours. Let's use the formula: distance = speed x time Distance covered by the first train + Distance covered by the second train = Total distance between the two stations 20t + 25(t-1) = 110 Simplifying the equation, we get: 45t = 135 t = 3 Therefore, the two trains will meet after 3 hours. The first train started at 7 a.m., so it will meet the second train at 10 a.m. Hence, the correct answer is (B) 10. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A man complete a journey in 10 hours. He travels first half of the journey at the rate of 20 km/hr and second half at the rate of 20 km/hr. Find the total journey in km. Answer Choices: (A) 220 km (B) 224 km (C) 230 km (D) 232 km (E) 200 km\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the total distance be 'd' km. The man travels the first half of the journey at a speed of 20 km/hr. Therefore, he covers the first half of the distance in d/2 * 20 = 10d/2 = 5d hours. Similarly, he covers the second half of the journey at a speed of 20 km/hr. Therefore, he covers the second half of the distance in d/2 * 20 = 10d/2 = 5d hours. Since the total time taken for the journey is 10 hours, we can write the equation: 5d/20 + 5d/20 = 10 Simplifying this equation, we get: d = 200 km Therefore, the total journey is 200 km. Hence, the correct answer is (E) 200 km. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Excluding stoppages, the speed of a train is 54 kmph and including stoppages it is 36 kmph. Of how many minutes does the train stop per hour? Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 17 (C) 15 (D) 18 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the train stops for x minutes per hour. When the train is running without any stoppages, its speed is 54 kmph. When the train is running with stoppages, its speed is 36 kmph. We know that, Speed = Distance/Time Let's assume that the distance covered by the train is 1 km. When the train is running without any stoppages, the time taken to cover 1 km is: Time = Distance/Speed = 1/54 hours = 60/54 minutes = 20/18 minutes When the train is running with stoppages, the time taken to cover 1 km is: Time = Distance/Speed = 1/36 hours = 60/36 minutes = 10/6 minutes We know that the difference in time is due to the time spent in stoppages. Therefore, time spent in stoppages for covering 1 km = (20/18) - (10/6) = (20 - 30)/18 = -10/18 hours We can convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60. Time spent in stoppages for covering 1 km = (-10/18) * 60 = -100/18 minutes This is a negative value, which means that the train is not stopping at all. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
