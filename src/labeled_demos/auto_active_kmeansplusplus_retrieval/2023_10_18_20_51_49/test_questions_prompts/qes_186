  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A salesman\u2019s terms were changed from a flat commission of 5% on all his sales to a fixed salary of Rs.900 plus 2.5% commission on all sales exceeding Rs. 4,000. If his remuneration as per new scheme was Rs. 600 more than that by the previous schema, his sales were worth? Answer Choices: (A) 10000 (B) 12000 (C) 12019 (D) 12197 (E) 12012\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the salesman's sales be x. Under the previous scheme, his commission would be 5% of x, which is 0.05x. Under the new scheme, his commission on sales exceeding Rs. 4,000 would be 2.5% of (x-4000), which is 0.025(x-4000). In addition, he has a fixed salary of Rs. 900. So his remuneration under the new scheme would be: 0.025(x-4000) + 900 And we know that this is Rs. 600 more than his remuneration under the previous scheme, which was 0.05x. So we can set up an equation: 0.025(x-4000) + 900 = 0.05x + 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.025x - 100 + 900 = 0.05x + 600 0.025x + 800 = 0.05x + 600 0.025x = 200 x = 8000 Therefore, his sales were worth Rs. 8,000. None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A shopkeeper sells 200 metres of cloth for Rs. 12000 at a loss of Rs.6 per metre. Find his cost price for one metre of cloth? Answer Choices: (A) s.59 (B) s.58 (C) s.09 (D) s.50 (E) s.66\nA: Let's think step by step. The shopkeeper sold 200 meters of cloth for Rs. 12000, which means he sold each meter for Rs. 60 (12000/200). Now, we know that he sold each meter at a loss of Rs. 6. So, his cost price for each meter would be Rs. 66 (60+6). Therefore, the correct answer is (E) Rs. 66. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Mohit sold an article for Rs. 18000. Had he offered a discount of 10% on the selling price, he would have earned a profit of 8%. What is the cost price of the article? Answer Choices: (A) 15000 (B) 15002 (C) 26879 (D) 26992 (E) 12681\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the cost price of the article be x. If Mohit had offered a discount of 10%, the selling price would have been 90% of the original selling price, which is 0.9 * 18000 = 16200. If he had earned a profit of 8%, the cost price would have been (16200/1.08) = 15000. Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 15000. The correct answer is (A) 15000. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Two employees X and Y are paid a total of Rs. 550 per week by their employer. If X is paid 120 percent of the sum paid to Y, how much is Y paid per week? Answer Choices: (A) Rs.150 (B) Rs.180 (C) Rs.200 (D) Rs.220 (E) Rs.250\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that Y is paid Rs. x per week. According to the problem, X is paid 120% of what Y is paid. So, X is paid 120/100 * x = 1.2x per week. We also know that the total amount paid to X and Y is Rs. 550 per week. So, we can write an equation: x + 1.2x = 550 Simplifying this equation, we get: 2.2x = 550 Dividing both sides by 2.2, we get: x = 250 Therefore, Y is paid Rs. 250 per week. The correct answer is (E) Rs.250. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
