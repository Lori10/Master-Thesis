  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The average age of students of a class is 15.8 years. The average age of boys in the class is 16.4 years and that of the girls is 15.4 years. The ration of the number of boys to the number of girls in the class is: Answer Choices: (A) 2:5 (B) 2:3 (C) 2:4 (D) 2:1 (E) 2:9\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the number of boys in the class be 'b' and the number of girls be 'g'. We know that the average age of the class is 15.8 years. So, the total age of all the students in the class = 15.8 x (b+g) We also know that the average age of boys in the class is 16.4 years. So, the total age of all the boys in the class = 16.4 x b Similarly, the total age of all the girls in the class = 15.4 x g Now, we can form an equation using the above information: (16.4 x b + 15.4 x g) / (b+g) = 15.8 Simplifying this equation, we get: 16.4b + 15.4g = 15.8b + 15.8g 0.6b = 0.4g b/g = 2/3 Therefore, the ratio of the number of boys to the number of girls in the class is 2:3. Hence, the correct answer is option (B) 2:3. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: At a contest with 2,500 participants, 1/2 of the people are aged 10 to 12. Next year, the number of people aged 10 to 12 will increase by 1/5. After this change, what percentage of the total 2,500 people will the 10- to 12-year-olds represent? Answer Choices: (A) 55% (B) 60% (C) 50% (D) 45% (E) 66%\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 at the contest. 1/2 of 2,500 = 1,250 people aged 10 to 12. Step 2: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1/5 of 1,250 = 250 people increase. 1,250 + 250 = 1,500 people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. Step 3: Find the percentage of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1,500/2,500 x 100% = 60% Therefore, the answer is (B) 60%. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In final exam of class IX there are 50 students 10 % students failed. How many students passed to class X? Answer Choices: (A) 33 (B) 378 (C) 37 (D) 39 (E) 45\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of students who failed the exam. 10% of 50 = (10/100) x 50 = 5 Step 2: Find the number of students who passed the exam. Total number of students - Number of students who failed = 50 - 5 = 45 Therefore, the answer is (E) 45. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In a class of 25 students in an examination in maths 3 students scored 95 marks each, 5 get zero each and the average of the rest was 45. What is the average of the whole class? Answer Choices: (A) A) 47 (B) B) 45.6 (C) C) 42 (D) D) 48 (E) E) 49\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total marks obtained by the class. Total marks obtained by the class = (3 students * 95 marks each) + (5 students * 0 marks each) + (17 students * 45 marks each) = 285 + 0 + 765 = 1050 Now, we can find the average of the whole class by dividing the total marks obtained by the number of students. Average of the whole class = Total marks obtained by the class / Number of students = 1050 / 25 = 42 Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 42. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
