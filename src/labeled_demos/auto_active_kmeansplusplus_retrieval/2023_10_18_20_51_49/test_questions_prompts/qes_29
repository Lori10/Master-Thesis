  "test_question": "Q: The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3. What is its length now? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 30 (C) 6 (D) 15 (E) 12",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Dividing by 3\u20446 and then multiplying by 5\u20446 is the same as dividing by what number? Answer Choices: (A) 31\u20445 (B) 16\u20445 (C) 20\u20449 (D) 9\u204420 (E) 5\u20443\nA: Let's think step by step. Dividing by 3/6 is the same as multiplying by 6/3, which simplifies to 2. So, we have: (dividing by 3/6) x (multiplying by 5/6) = (multiplying by 6/3) x (5/6) = 2 x 5/3 = 10/3 Therefore, the answer is (E) 5/3. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: The greatest possible length which can be used to measure exactly the length 8m ,2m 15cm, 8m 90 cm is? Answer Choices: (A) 25cm (B) 101cm (C) 56cm (D) 42cm (E) 5cm\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the given lengths. 8m = 800cm 2m 15cm = 215cm 8m 90cm = 890cm Now, we need to find the GCF of 800, 215, and 890. The prime factorization of 800 is 2^5 x 5^2. The prime factorization of 215 is 5 x 43. The prime factorization of 890 is 2 x 5 x 89. The GCF of these three numbers is 5, since it is the only factor they have in common. Therefore, the greatest possible length that can be used to measure exactly 8m, 2m 15cm, and 8m 90cm is 5cm. The answer is (E) 5cm. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: If the ratio of a to b is 2 to 3 and the ratio of b to c is 1 to 5, what is the ratio of a to c? Answer Choices: (A) 4/15 (B) 1/3 (C) 2/15 (D) 4/5 (E) 7/6\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find a common term between a, b, and c. We can do this by using the ratio of b to c, which is 1 to 5. We can multiply both sides by 3 to get the ratio of b to c in terms of b and a common term: b:c = 1:5 3b:15c = 1:5 b:5c = 1/3 Now we can use the ratio of a to b, which is 2 to 3, to express a in terms of b: a:b = 2:3 2b:3b = 2:3 a:b = 2/3 We can substitute this expression for a/b into the previous equation to get the ratio of a to c: a:b = 2/3 b:5c = 1/3 a:5c = (2/3)*(1/3) = 2/9 Therefore, the answer is (C) 2/15. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The ratio 5:20 expressed as percent equals to Answer Choices: (A) 50 % (B) 125 % (C) 25 % (D) None of above (E) 30%\nA: Let's think step by step. The ratio 5:20 can be simplified by dividing both numbers by 5. 5:20 = 1:4 Now, we need to convert this ratio to a percentage. To do this, we need to find out what percentage 1 is of 4. 1 is 25% of 4. Therefore, the answer is (C) 25%. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
