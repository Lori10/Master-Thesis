  "test_question": "Q: A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number. Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 2520 (C) 1728 (D) 1656 (E) None",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If 288 is divided into four parts proportional to 5, 7, 4, 8 then the smallest part is : Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 44 (C) 20 (D) 48 (E) 42\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total proportion: 5 + 7 + 4 + 8 = 24 Next, we need to find the proportion of each part: 5/24, 7/24, 4/24, 8/24 Simplifying these fractions, we get: 5/24, 7/24, 1/6, 1/3 Now, we can find the value of each part by multiplying its proportion by the total value: 5/24 x 288 = 60 7/24 x 288 = 84 1/6 x 288 = 48 1/3 x 288 = 96 Therefore, the smallest part is 48, which corresponds to the proportion of 1/6. The correct answer is (D) 48. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: what is the smallest number should be added to 5377 so that the sum is completely divisible by 7? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 4 (C) 6 (D) 2 (E) 1\nA: Let's think step by step. To make a number completely divisible by 7, we need to add the smallest number that will make the sum a multiple of 7. We can find this number by taking the remainder of the original number when divided by 7 and subtracting it from 7. So, let's find the remainder of 5377 when divided by 7: 5377 \u00f7 7 = 768 R 1 So, the remainder is 1. To make the sum completely divisible by 7, we need to add: 7 - 1 = 6 Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 6. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In a division sum, the divisor is ten times the quotient and five times the remainder. If the remainder is 38, the dividend is: Answer Choices: (A) 3648 (B) 3642 (C) 3636 (D) 3644 (E) 3864\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the quotient to be x. According to the problem, the divisor is ten times the quotient, which means the divisor is 10x. Also, the divisor is five times the remainder, which means the remainder is 10x/5 or 2x. Given that the remainder is 38, we can solve for x: 2x = 38 x = 19 Now that we know the quotient is 19, we can find the dividend by using the formula: Dividend = Divisor x Quotient + Remainder Dividend = 10x19 + 38 Dividend = 190 + 38 Dividend = 228 Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above, as none of the options match the calculated dividend of 228. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Three numbers are in the ratio 3:5:7. The largest number value is 42. Find difference between Smallest & largest number is? Answer Choices: (A) 24 (B) 26 (C) 28 (D) 30 (E) 32\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the value of the smallest number. We know that the three numbers are in the ratio 3:5:7, so we can represent them as 3x, 5x, and 7x. We also know that the largest number is 42, which is equal to 7x. Therefore, x = 6. Now we can find the values of the other two numbers: Smallest number = 3x = 3(6) = 18 Middle number = 5x = 5(6) = 30 The difference between the smallest and largest numbers is: 42 - 18 = 24 Therefore, the answer is (A) 24. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
