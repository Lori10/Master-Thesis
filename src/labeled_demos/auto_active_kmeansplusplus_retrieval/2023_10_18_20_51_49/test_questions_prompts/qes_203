  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If doubling a number and adding 20 to the result gives the same answer as multiplying the number by 8 and taking away 4 from the product, the number is Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 4 (D) 5 (E) 6\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the number is x. According to the problem, we can create the following equation: 2x + 20 = 8x - 4 Now we can solve for x: 2x + 20 = 8x - 4 Add 4 to both sides: 2x + 24 = 8x Subtract 2x from both sides: 24 = 6x Divide both sides by 6: x = 4 Therefore, the answer is (C) 4. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If (x^2 + 1)y=8, which of the following is not a possible value for y? Answer Choices: (A) 8/2 (B) 2/5 (C) 18/3 (D) 3 (E) 17/2\nA: Let's think step by step. We are given the equation (x^2 + 1)y = 8. To find the possible values of y, we need to solve for y. Dividing both sides by (x^2 + 1), we get: y = 8/(x^2 + 1) So, any value of y that makes the denominator (x^2 + 1) equal to zero is not possible, as division by zero is undefined. The denominator (x^2 + 1) is always positive, so it can never be zero. Therefore, all the given answer choices are possible values of y. Hence, the answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: x + y = 19 , and x + 3y = 1. Find the value of x + 2y Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 18 (C) 11 (D) 10 (E) 5\nA: Let's think step by step. We have two equations: x + y = 19 (equation 1) x + 3y = 1 (equation 2) We need to find the value of x + 2y. We can solve for x in equation 1: x = 19 - y Substitute this value of x in equation 2: (19 - y) + 3y = 1 Simplifying this equation, we get: 2y = -18 y = -9 Now, substitute this value of y in equation 1 to find x: x + (-9) = 19 x = 28 Therefore, x + 2y = 28 + 2(-9) = 10 Hence, the answer is (D) 10. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A man is 24 years older than his son. In two years, his age will be twice the age of his son. The present age of the son is? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 25 (C) 27 (D) 22 (E) 91\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the present age of the son be x. According to the problem, the man is 24 years older than his son, so his present age is x + 24. In two years, the man's age will be x + 24 + 2 = x + 26, and the son's age will be x + 2. The problem states that in two years, the man's age will be twice the age of his son: x + 26 = 2(x + 2) Simplifying the equation: x + 26 = 2x + 4 Subtracting x from both sides: 26 = x + 4 Subtracting 4 from both sides: 22 = x Therefore, the present age of the son is 22. The correct answer is (D) 22. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
