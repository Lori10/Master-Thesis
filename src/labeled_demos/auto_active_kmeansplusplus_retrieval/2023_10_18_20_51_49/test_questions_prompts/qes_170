  "test_question": "Q: A rope 20 meters long is cut into two pieces. If the length of one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the other, what is the length, in meters, of the longer piece of rope? Answer Choices: (A) 7.5 (B) 8.9 (C) 9.9 (D) 11.5 (E) 11.7",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A rectangular plot measuring 90 metres by 50 metres is to be enclosed by wire fencing. If the poles of the fence are kept 5 metres apart, how many poles will be needed ? Answer Choices: (A) 55 (B) 56 (C) 57 (D) 58 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular plot. Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 2(90 + 50) = 280 meters Next, we need to find the number of poles required if they are kept 5 meters apart. We can divide the perimeter by the distance between two poles: Number of poles = Perimeter / Distance between two poles Number of poles = 280 / 5 = 56 Therefore, the answer is (B) 56. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: The greatest possible length which can be used to measure exactly the length 8m ,2m 15cm, 8m 90 cm is? Answer Choices: (A) 25cm (B) 101cm (C) 56cm (D) 42cm (E) 5cm\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the given lengths. 8m = 800cm 2m 15cm = 215cm 8m 90cm = 890cm Now, we need to find the GCF of 800, 215, and 890. The prime factorization of 800 is 2^5 x 5^2. The prime factorization of 215 is 5 x 43. The prime factorization of 890 is 2 x 5 x 89. The GCF of these three numbers is 5, since it is the only factor they have in common. Therefore, the greatest possible length that can be used to measure exactly 8m, 2m 15cm, and 8m 90cm is 5cm. The answer is (E) 5cm. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A train running at the speed of 60 km/hr crosses a pole in 6 seconds. What is the length of the train? Answer Choices: (A) 120 metres (B) 180 metres (C) 324 metres (D) 100 metres (E) 180 metres\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that the train crosses a pole in 6 seconds. This means that the length of the train is equal to the distance it covers in 6 seconds at a speed of 60 km/hr. First, we need to convert the speed from km/hr to m/s. 60 km/hr = (60 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 16.67 m/s (rounded off to two decimal places) Now, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time distance = 16.67 m/s x 6 s = 100.02 meters (rounded off to two decimal places) Therefore, the length of the train is 100 meters. The correct answer is (D) 100 metres. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Calculate the time it will take for a train that is 120 meter long to pass a bridge of 160 meter length, if the speed of the train is 40 km/hour ? Answer Choices: (A) 21.2 seconds (B) 25.2 seconds (C) 29.2 seconds (D) 35.2 seconds (E) 11.2 seconds\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/hour to m/s. 40 km/hour = (40 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 11.11 m/s (approx) Now, we need to find the total distance that the train will cover while passing the bridge. Total distance = length of train + length of bridge = 120 + 160 = 280 meters Next, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed time = 280 / 11.11 = 25.21 seconds (approx) Therefore, the answer is (B) 25.2 seconds. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
