  "test_question": "Q: An express electric train takes exact three seconds to enter tunnel which is 1 mile long.\nIf train is traveling at 120 mile an hour, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel ? Answer Choices: (A) 43 seconds (B) 39 seconds (C) 20 seconds (D) 33 seconds (E) 55 seconds",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A train 440 meters long is running with a speed of 50 kmph. The time taken by it to cross a tunnel 180 meters long is? Answer Choices: (A) 40.33 sec (B) 41.33 sec (C) 42.33 sec (D) 40 sec (E) 44.64 sec\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed from kmph to m/s. 50 kmph = (50 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 13.89 m/s Now, we can find the time taken by the train to cross the tunnel and the train together. Total distance to be covered = length of train + length of tunnel = 440 + 180 = 620 meters Time taken = distance / speed = 620 / 13.89 = 44.64 seconds Therefore, the answer is (E) 44.64 sec. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A train 700 m long is running at a speed of 78 km/hr. If it crosses a tunnel in 1 min, then the length of the tunnel is? Answer Choices: (A) 298 m (B) 468 m (C) 600 m (D) 667 m (E) 781 m\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s. 78 km/hr = (78 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 21.67 m/s Next, we need to find the time taken by the train to cross the tunnel. We know that the length of the train is 700 m and it crosses the tunnel in 1 min (60 seconds). Therefore, the speed of the train relative to the tunnel is: Speed = Distance / Time Speed = (700 + Length of tunnel) / 60 Speed = (700 + Length of tunnel) / 60 Multiplying both sides by 60: Speed x 60 = 700 + Length of tunnel 21.67 x 60 = 700 + Length of tunnel 1300.2 - 700 = Length of tunnel Length of tunnel = 600.2 m Therefore, the length of the tunnel is approximately 600 m. The closest answer choice is (C) 600 m. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A train is 320 meter long is running at a speed of 45 km/hour. In what time will it pass a bridge of 140 meter length? Answer Choices: (A) 11 seconds (B) 38 seconds (C) 40 seconds (D) 88 seconds (E) 36.8 seconds\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed from km/hour to m/s. 45 km/hour = (45 * 1000) / (60 * 60) m/s = 12.5 m/s Next, we need to find the total distance the train will cover when passing the bridge. Total distance = length of train + length of bridge = 320 + 140 = 460 meters Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed time = 460 / 12.5 = 36.8 seconds Therefore, the answer is (E) 36.8 seconds. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Calculate the time it will take for a train that is 120 meter long to pass a bridge of 160 meter length, if the speed of the train is 40 km/hour ? Answer Choices: (A) 21.2 seconds (B) 25.2 seconds (C) 29.2 seconds (D) 35.2 seconds (E) 11.2 seconds\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/hour to m/s. 40 km/hour = (40 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 11.11 m/s (approx) Now, we need to find the total distance that the train will cover while passing the bridge. Total distance = length of train + length of bridge = 120 + 160 = 280 meters Next, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed time = 280 / 11.11 = 25.21 seconds (approx) Therefore, the answer is (B) 25.2 seconds. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
