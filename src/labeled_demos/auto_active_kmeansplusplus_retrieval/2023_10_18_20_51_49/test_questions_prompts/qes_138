  "test_question": "Q: IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink? Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Solution A is 10% salt and Solution B is 80% salt. If you have 30 ounces of solution A and 60 ounces of solution B, in what ratio could you mix Solution A with Solution B to produce 50 ounces of a 50% salt solution? Answer Choices: (A) 6:4 (B) 6:14 (C) 3:4 (D) 4:6 (E) 3:7\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Calculate the amount of salt in Solution A and Solution B. - Solution A: 10% of 30 ounces = 3 ounces of salt - Solution B: 80% of 60 ounces = 48 ounces of salt Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the amount of salt in the final mixture. - Let x be the amount of Solution A needed to make 50 ounces of a 50% salt solution. - Then, (50 - x) is the amount of Solution B needed. - The equation is: 0.1x + 0.8(50 - x) = 0.5(50) Step 3: Solve for x. - 0.1x + 40 - 0.8x = 25 - -0.7x = -15 - x = 21.43 Step 4: Calculate the ratio of Solution A to Solution B. - Solution A: 21.43 ounces - Solution B: 50 - 21.43 = 28.57 ounces - Ratio of Solution A to Solution B = 21.43:28.57 = 3:4 Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 3:4. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Jill has 21 gallons of water stored in quart, half-gallon, and one gallon jars. She has equal numbers of each size jar holding the liquid. What is the total number of water filled jars? Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 6 (C) 9 (D) 36 (E) 14\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert all the jars to the same unit, either quarts, half-gallons, or gallons. Let's convert everything to quarts since it's the smallest unit. One gallon is equal to 4 quarts, so Jill has 21 x 4 = 84 quarts of water. Let's say she has x jars of each size. Each quart jar contains 1 quart of water, each half-gallon jar contains 2 quarts of water, and each gallon jar contains 4 quarts of water. So we can set up the equation: 1x + 2x + 4x = 84 7x = 84 x = 12 Therefore, Jill has 12 jars of each size, for a total of 3 x 12 = 36 jars. The answer is (D) 36. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A drink vendor has 60 liters of Maaza, 144 liters of Pepsi and 368 liters of Sprite. He wants to pack them in cans, so that each can contains the same number of liters of a drink, and doesn't want to mix any two drinks in a can. What is the least number of cans required? Answer Choices: (A) 135 (B) 137 (C) 143 (D) 310 (E) 380\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 60, 144, and 368 to determine the maximum number of liters that can be packed in a can. The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. The prime factorization of 144 is 2^4 * 3^2. The prime factorization of 368 is 2^4 * 23. The GCD of these three numbers is 12 (2^2 * 3). Therefore, each can can contain a maximum of 12 liters of a drink. To find the least number of cans required, we need to divide each quantity by 12 and round up to the nearest integer. 60/12 = 5 144/12 = 12 368/12 = 31 So we need at least 5 cans of Maaza, 12 cans of Pepsi, and 31 cans of Sprite. The total number of cans required is 5 + 12 + 31 = 48. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: By weight, liquid X makes up 0.5 percent of solution P and 1.5 percent of solution Q. If 200 grams of solution P are mixed with 800 grams of solution Q, then liquid X accounts for what percent of the weight of the resulting solution? Answer Choices: (A) 1.3% (B) 1.2% (C) 1.1% (D) 1.0% (E) 0.9%\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much liquid X is in 200 grams of solution P and 800 grams of solution Q. Liquid X in 200 grams of solution P = 0.5% of 200 grams = 1 gram Liquid X in 800 grams of solution Q = 1.5% of 800 grams = 12 grams Total liquid X in the resulting solution = 1 gram + 12 grams = 13 grams Now, we need to find out what percent of the weight of the resulting solution is 13 grams. Total weight of resulting solution = 200 grams + 800 grams = 1000 grams Percent of liquid X in the resulting solution = (13 grams / 1000 grams) x 100% = 1.3% Therefore, the answer is (A) 1.3%. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
