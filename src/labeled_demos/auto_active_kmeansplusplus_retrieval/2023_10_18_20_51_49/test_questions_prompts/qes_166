  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A shopkeeper sells 200 metres of cloth for Rs. 12000 at a loss of Rs.6 per metre. Find his cost price for one metre of cloth? Answer Choices: (A) s.59 (B) s.58 (C) s.09 (D) s.50 (E) s.66\nA: Let's think step by step. The shopkeeper sold 200 meters of cloth for Rs. 12000, which means he sold each meter for Rs. 60 (12000/200). Now, we know that he sold each meter at a loss of Rs. 6. So, his cost price for each meter would be Rs. 66 (60+6). Therefore, the correct answer is (E) Rs. 66. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Mohit sold an article for Rs. 18000. Had he offered a discount of 10% on the selling price, he would have earned a profit of 8%. What is the cost price of the article? Answer Choices: (A) 15000 (B) 15002 (C) 26879 (D) 26992 (E) 12681\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the cost price of the article be x. If Mohit had offered a discount of 10%, the selling price would have been 90% of the original selling price, which is 0.9 * 18000 = 16200. If he had earned a profit of 8%, the cost price would have been (16200/1.08) = 15000. Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 15000. The correct answer is (A) 15000. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The value of a machine depreciates at 23% per annum. If its present value is $1,50,000, at what price should it be sold after two years such that a profit of $24,000 is made? Answer Choices: (A) $252935 (B) $432935 (C) $122935 (D) $112935 (E) $152935\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the depreciated value of the machine after two years. The value of the machine depreciates at 23% per annum, which means that after one year, its value will be 77% of its original value (100% - 23% = 77%). So, after two years, its value will be 77% of 77% of its original value: = 0.77 x 0.77 x $1,50,000 = $84,297.50 Now, we need to add the profit of $24,000 to this value to get the selling price: = $84,297.50 + $24,000 = $1,08,297.50 Therefore, the correct answer is (D) $112935. None of the given options match the calculated value exactly, but option (D) is the closest. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: The value of a machine depreciates at 22% per annum. If its present value is $1,50,000, at what price should it be sold after two years such that a profit of $24,000 is made? Answer Choices: (A) $255260 (B) $435260 (C) $125260 (D) $115260 (E) $155260\nA: Let's think step by step. The machine depreciates at 22% per annum, which means its value decreases by 22% every year. After two years, the value of the machine will be: $1,50,000 x (1 - 0.22) x (1 - 0.22) = $1,50,000 x 0.78 x 0.78 = $87,156 To make a profit of $24,000, the machine should be sold for: $87,156 + $24,000 = $1,11,156 Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above, as none of the given options match the calculated value of $1,11,156. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
