  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Ayush was born two years after his father's marriage. His mother is five years younger than his father but 22 years older than Ayush who is 10 years old. At what age did the father get married ? Answer Choices: (A) 22years (B) 23years (C) 24years (D) 25years (E) 26years\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the father got married at age x. According to the problem, Ayush is currently 10 years old. Therefore, his father's age would be (x + 10) years old. We also know that Ayush's mother is 5 years younger than his father. Therefore, her age would be (x + 10 - 5) = (x + 5) years old. Finally, we know that Ayush's mother is 22 years older than Ayush. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 5 = 10 + 22 Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 27 Therefore, the father got married at age 27 - 2 = 25 years old. The correct answer is (D) 25 years. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Ratio between Rahul and Deepak is 4:3, After 6 Years Rahul age will be 18 years. What is Deepak present age? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 15 (C) 77 (D) 9 (E) 182\nA: Let's think step by step. Given, the ratio of Rahul and Deepak's age is 4:3. Let's assume their ages to be 4x and 3x respectively. After 6 years, Rahul's age will be 18 years. So, his present age is 18 - 6 = 12 years. We can now use this information to find the value of x. 4x = 12 x = 3 Therefore, Rahul's present age is 4x = 4 * 3 = 12 years. Now, we can find Deepak's present age. Deepak's age = 3x = 3 * 3 = 9 years. Hence, the correct answer is (D) 9. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A man is 24 years older than his son. In two years, his age will be twice the age of his son. The present age of the son is? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 25 (C) 27 (D) 22 (E) 91\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the present age of the son be x. According to the problem, the man is 24 years older than his son, so his present age is x + 24. In two years, the man's age will be x + 24 + 2 = x + 26, and the son's age will be x + 2. The problem states that in two years, the man's age will be twice the age of his son: x + 26 = 2(x + 2) Simplifying the equation: x + 26 = 2x + 4 Subtracting x from both sides: 26 = x + 4 Subtracting 4 from both sides: 22 = x Therefore, the present age of the son is 22. The correct answer is (D) 22. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A father was as old as his son's present at the time of your birth. If the father's age is 38 years now, the son's age 5years back was? Answer Choices: (A) 10 years (B) 12 years (C) 14 years (D) 16 years (E) 18 years\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the son's present age be x. According to the problem, the father's age at the time of the son's birth was x. Now, the father's present age is 38. So, the age difference between the father and son is 38 - x. We need to find the son's age 5 years back, which means we need to subtract 5 from x. So, (38 - x) = x - 5 Solving this equation, we get x = 14 Therefore, the son's age 5 years back was 14 - 5 = 9 The correct answer is not given in the options. None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
