  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The 30 members of a club decided to play a badminton singles tournament. Every time a member loses a game he is out of the tournament. There are no ties. What is the minimum number of matches that must be played to determine the winner ? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 29 (C) 64 (D) 39 (E) 35\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine how many rounds of matches will be played. Since each match eliminates one player, there will be 29 matches in the first round (30 players divided into 15 matches). After the first round, there will be 15 players left, so there will be 7 matches in the second round (8 players divided into 4 matches) and 4 matches in the third round (4 players divided into 2 matches). Finally, there will be one match in the fourth round to determine the winner. Therefore, the total number of matches played will be 29 + 7 + 4 + 1 = 41. None of the answer choices match our calculation, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: 15 chess players take part in a tournament. Every player plays twice with each of his opponents. How many games are to be played? Answer Choices: (A) 190 (B) 200 (C) 210 (D) 220 (E) 225\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 15 players in the tournament. Each player plays twice with every other player. So, the number of games played by each player is 14 (since they don't play against themselves). Therefore, the total number of games played in the tournament is: 15 players x 14 games each = 210 games So, the correct answer is (C) 210. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In a club with 310 peopl, 138 play tennis, 255 play baseball, and 94 people play both sports. How many people do not pla a sport? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 8 (C) 4 (D) 10 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 138 people play tennis, 255 people play baseball, and 94 people play both sports. To find the number of people who play only tennis, we can subtract the number of people who play both sports from the number of people who play tennis: 138 - 94 = 44 Similarly, to find the number of people who play only baseball, we can subtract the number of people who play both sports from the number of people who play baseball: 255 - 94 = 161 Now, to find the number of people who do not play a sport, we need to subtract the total number of people who play a sport from the total number of people in the club: 310 - (44 + 161 + 94) = 11 Therefore, the answer is (E) 11. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In an entrance exam, 3 marks is awarded for every correct answer and (-1) for every wrong answer. If a student gets 38 marks after attempting all questions, find the number of questions answered correctly if the total questions were 70. Answer Choices: (A) 38 (B) 40 (C) 27 (D) 43 (E) 56\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the number of questions answered correctly is x. Then the number of questions answered incorrectly would be (70-x). Now, we can use the given information to form an equation: 3x - 1(70-x) = 38 Simplifying this equation: 3x - 70 + x = 38 4x = 108 x = 27 Therefore, the student answered 27 questions correctly. The correct answer is (C) 27. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
