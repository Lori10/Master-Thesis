  "test_question": "Q: A man walks at 5 kmph for 6 hrs and at 4 kmph for 12 hrs. His average speed is Answer Choices: (A) 4 1/3 km/h (B) 7 2/3 km/h (C) 9 \u00bd km/h (D) 8 km/h (E) 81 km/h",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A person crosses a 600 m long street in 2 minutes. What is his speed in km per hour? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 24 (C) 18 (D) 42 (E) 64\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the distance from meters to kilometers. We can do this by dividing 600 by 1000, which gives us 0.6 km. Next, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. We can do this by dividing 2 by 60, which gives us 0.0333 hours (rounded to four decimal places). Finally, we can calculate the speed by dividing the distance by the time. So, speed = distance/time = 0.6/0.0333 = 18 (rounded to the nearest whole number). Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 18. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A driver covers a certain distance by car driving at 60 km/hr and returns back to the starting point riding on a scooter at 10 km/hr. What was the average speed for the whole journey? Answer Choices: (A) 14.2 km/h (B) 17.1 km/h (C) 19.3 km/h (D) 21.7 km/h (E) 23.5 km/h\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the distance covered by the driver is 'd' km. The time taken to cover the distance by car at 60 km/hr is given by: Time taken = Distance/Speed = d/60 The time taken to cover the same distance by scooter at 10 km/hr is given by: Time taken = Distance/Speed = d/10 The total time taken for the whole journey is the sum of the time taken for the onward journey and the time taken for the return journey. Total time taken = d/60 + d/10 = (d + 6d)/60 = 7d/60 The average speed for the whole journey is given by: Average speed = Total distance/Total time taken Total distance = 2d (since the driver covers the same distance twice) Average speed = 2d/(7d/60) = 120/7 km/hr Rounding off to one decimal place, we get the answer as (A) 14.2 km/h. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A man whose speed is 3.5 kmph in still water rows to a certain upstream point and back to the starting point in a river which flows at 1.5 kmph, find his average speed for the total journey? Answer Choices: (A) 2.0 (B) 2.5 (C) 3.0 (D) 2.1 (E) 4.0\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. Let the distance between the starting point and the upstream point be 'd' km. Speed of the man in upstream = (3.5 - 1.5) kmph = 2 kmph (as the river flows at 1.5 kmph in the opposite direction) Time taken by the man to row to the upstream point = d/2 kmph Speed of the man in downstream = (3.5 + 1.5) kmph = 5 kmph (as the river flows at 1.5 kmph in the same direction) Time taken by the man to row back to the starting point = d/5 kmph Total time taken by the man for the entire journey = (d/2) + (d/5) = (5d + 2d)/10 = (7d/10) hours Total distance covered by the man in the entire journey = 2d km (as he rows to the upstream point and back to the starting point) Average speed for the entire journey = Total distance covered / Total time taken = 2d / (7d/10) = (20/7) kmph = 2.86 kmph (approx.) Therefore, the correct answer is (None of the above). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A train , having a length of 110 meter is running at a speed of 60 kmph. In what time, it will pass a man who is running at 6 kmph in the direction opposite to that of the train Answer Choices: (A) 10 sec (B) 8 sec (C) 6 sec (D) 4 sec (E) 2 sec\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the train from kmph to m/s. 60 kmph = (60 x 1000) / (60 x 60) = 16.67 m/s Similarly, we need to convert the speed of the man from kmph to m/s. 6 kmph = (6 x 1000) / (60 x 60) = 1.67 m/s Now, we need to find the relative speed of the train and the man. Relative speed = Speed of train + Speed of man = 16.67 + 1.67 = 18.34 m/s We know that distance = speed x time Here, the distance to be covered is the length of the train (110 meters). So, 110 = 18.34 x time Time = 110 / 18.34 Time = 6 seconds Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 6 sec. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
