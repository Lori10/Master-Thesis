  "test_question": "Q: When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I am 60 years old, how old is my brother? Answer Choices: (A) A) 59 (B) B) 69 (C) C) 79 (D) D) 89 (E) E) 99",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 99 (C) 88 (D) 77 (E) 23\nA: Let's think step by step. Let Q's age be x. Then, R's age will be (x + y) and T's age will be (x - y), where y is the age difference between Q and T. Given, (x + y) + (x - y) = 50 2x = 50 x = 25 Therefore, Q's age is 25. Also, R's age is (25 + y). Given, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, (25 + y) - 25 = 25 - (25 - y) y = 12.5 Therefore, R's age is (25 + 12.5) = 37.5 The difference between R and Q's age is (37.5 - 25) = 12.5 Hence, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Rose is two years older than Bruce who is twice as old as Chris. If the total of the age of Rose, B and Chris be 47 years, then how old is Bruce ? Answer Choices: (A) 18 years (B) 10 years (C) 12 years (D) 13 years (E) 14 years\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's start by assigning variables to the ages of Bruce and Chris. Let's say Bruce's age is B and Chris's age is C. According to the problem, Rose is two years older than Bruce, so her age can be represented as B + 2. We also know that Bruce is twice as old as Chris, so we can write: B = 2C Now we can substitute B = 2C into the equation for the total of their ages: (B + 2) + B + C = 47 Simplifying this equation: 2B + C = 45 Substituting B = 2C: 4C + C = 45 5C = 45 C = 9 Now we can find Bruce's age: B = 2C = 2(9) = 18 So the answer is (A) 18 years. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A man is 24 years older than his son. In two years, his age will be twice the age of his son. The present age of the son is? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 25 (C) 27 (D) 22 (E) 91\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the present age of the son be x. According to the problem, the man is 24 years older than his son, so his present age is x + 24. In two years, the man's age will be x + 24 + 2 = x + 26, and the son's age will be x + 2. The problem states that in two years, the man's age will be twice the age of his son: x + 26 = 2(x + 2) Simplifying the equation: x + 26 = 2x + 4 Subtracting x from both sides: 26 = x + 4 Subtracting 4 from both sides: 22 = x Therefore, the present age of the son is 22. The correct answer is (D) 22. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A father was as old as his son's present at the time of your birth. If the father's age is 38 years now, the son's age 5years back was? Answer Choices: (A) 10 years (B) 12 years (C) 14 years (D) 16 years (E) 18 years\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the son's present age be x. According to the problem, the father's age at the time of the son's birth was x. Now, the father's present age is 38. So, the age difference between the father and son is 38 - x. We need to find the son's age 5 years back, which means we need to subtract 5 from x. So, (38 - x) = x - 5 Solving this equation, we get x = 14 Therefore, the son's age 5 years back was 14 - 5 = 9 The correct answer is not given in the options. None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
