  "test_question": "Q: Machine A puts out a yo-yo every 6 minutes. Machine B puts out a yo-yo every 9 minutes. After how many minutes will they have produced 10 yo-yos? Answer Choices: (A) 24 minutes (B) 32 minutes (C) 36 minutes (D) 64 minutes (E) 72 minutes",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Running at the same rate, 8 identical machines can produce 560 paperclips a minute. At this rate, how many paperclips could 12 machines produce in 6 minutes? Answer Choices: (A) 1344 (B) 3360 (C) 8400 (D) 5040 (E) 67200\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the rate of production of one machine per minute. To find the rate of production of one machine per minute, we divide the total production by the number of machines: 560 paperclips/8 machines = 70 paperclips/machine Step 2: Find the rate of production of 12 machines per minute. To find the rate of production of 12 machines per minute, we multiply the rate of production of one machine by 12: 70 paperclips/machine x 12 machines = 840 paperclips/minute Step 3: Find the total production in 6 minutes. To find the total production in 6 minutes, we multiply the rate of production of 12 machines per minute by 6: 840 paperclips/minute x 6 minutes = 5040 paperclips Therefore, the answer is (D) 5040. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 25 copies per minute. A second copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 55 copies per minute. Working together at their respective rates, how many copies do the two machines make in half an hour ? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 2,400 (C) 4,500 (D) 5,400 (E) 324,000\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the combined rate of the two machines. To do this, we add their individual rates: 25 copies/minute + 55 copies/minute = 80 copies/minute Next, we need to convert half an hour to minutes: 30 minutes Now we can use the formula: rate x time = amount Plugging in the values we have: 80 copies/minute x 30 minutes = 2400 copies Therefore, the answer is (B) 2,400. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Working simultaneously and independently at an identical constant rate, 10 machines of a certain type can produce a total of x units of product P in 4 days. How many of these machines, working simultaneously and independently at this constant rate, can produce a total of 3x units of product P in 6 days? Answer Choices: (A) 14 (B) 15 (C) 18 (D) 20 (E) 22\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the rate at which one machine produces product P. To do this, we can divide the total number of units produced by the number of machines and the number of days: Rate of one machine = x / (10 * 4) = x / 40 Next, we need to find how many machines are needed to produce 3x units of product P in 6 days. We can use the same formula, but with the new values: Rate of one machine = 3x / (n * 6) where n is the number of machines needed. We can set these two expressions equal to each other and solve for n: x / 40 = 3x / (n * 6) Multiplying both sides by 40n gives: xn = 720x Dividing both sides by x gives: n = 720 / 40 = 18 Therefore, the answer is (C) 18. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Machine E can produce x units in 3/4 of the time it takes machine N to produce x units. Machine N can produce x units in 2/3 the time it takes machine O to produce x units. If all three machines are working simultaneously, what fraction of the total output is produced by machine N? Answer Choices: (A)  1/2 (B)  1/3 (C)  4/13 (D)  8/29 (E)  6/33\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that machine O takes t time to produce x units. Then, machine N will take 2t/3 time to produce x units and machine E will take 3t/4 time to produce x units. Now, let's find the rate of production of each machine. Machine O produces x/t units per unit time. Machine N produces x/(2t/3) = 3x/(2t) units per unit time. Machine E produces x/(3t/4) = 4x/(3t) units per unit time. If all three machines are working simultaneously, then the total rate of production is the sum of the individual rates of production. So, the total rate of production is: x/t + 3x/(2t) + 4x/(3t) = (13x/6t) Therefore, machine N's contribution to the total output is: (3x/(2t)) / (13x/6t) = 9/26 So, the answer is (D) 8/29. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
