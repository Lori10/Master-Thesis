  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Three numbers are in the ratio 3:5:7. The largest number value is 42. Find difference between Smallest & largest number is? Answer Choices: (A) 24 (B) 26 (C) 28 (D) 30 (E) 32\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the value of the smallest number. We know that the three numbers are in the ratio 3:5:7, so we can represent them as 3x, 5x, and 7x. We also know that the largest number is 42, which is equal to 7x. Therefore, x = 6. Now we can find the values of the other two numbers: Smallest number = 3x = 3(6) = 18 Middle number = 5x = 5(6) = 30 The difference between the smallest and largest numbers is: 42 - 18 = 24 Therefore, the answer is (A) 24. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Two numbers are in the ratio of 2:3 . if 4 is added in both numbers the ratio becomes 5:7. Find the difference between numbers. Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 2 (E) 10\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the two numbers be 2x and 3x (since they are in the ratio of 2:3). When 4 is added to both numbers, they become 2x+4 and 3x+4. Now, the ratio of 2x+4 to 3x+4 is given as 5:7. So, we can write the equation: (2x+4)/(3x+4) = 5/7 Cross-multiplying, we get: 14x + 28 = 15x + 20 Simplifying, we get: x = 8 Therefore, the two numbers are 2x = 16 and 3x = 24. The difference between these numbers is 24 - 16 = 8. Hence, the answer is (A) 8. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: If the ratio of a to b is 2 to 3 and the ratio of b to c is 1 to 5, what is the ratio of a to c? Answer Choices: (A) 4/15 (B) 1/3 (C) 2/15 (D) 4/5 (E) 7/6\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find a common term between a, b, and c. We can do this by using the ratio of b to c, which is 1 to 5. We can multiply both sides by 3 to get the ratio of b to c in terms of b and a common term: b:c = 1:5 3b:15c = 1:5 b:5c = 1/3 Now we can use the ratio of a to b, which is 2 to 3, to express a in terms of b: a:b = 2:3 2b:3b = 2:3 a:b = 2/3 We can substitute this expression for a/b into the previous equation to get the ratio of a to c: a:b = 2/3 b:5c = 1/3 a:5c = (2/3)*(1/3) = 2/9 Therefore, the answer is (C) 2/15. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: What number has a 5:1 ratio to the number 10? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 50 (C) 99 (D) 72 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. The ratio of two numbers is the quotient of the two numbers. Here, we are given that the ratio of the unknown number to 10 is 5:1. So, we can set up the equation: x/10 = 5/1 where x is the unknown number. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: x = 10 * 5 x = 50 Therefore, the number that has a 5:1 ratio to the number 10 is 50. The correct answer is (B) 50. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
