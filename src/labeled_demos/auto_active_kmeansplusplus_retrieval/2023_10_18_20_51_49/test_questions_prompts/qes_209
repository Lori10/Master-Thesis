  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Train A and Train B began traveling towards each other from opposite ends of a 480-mile long track at 1:00 PM. If Train A traveled at 35 miles per hour and Train B traveled at 25 miles per hour, at what time did the trains meet? Answer Choices: (A) 5:40 PM (B) 6:00 PM (C) 7:20 PM (D) 9:00 PM (E) 9:20 PM\nA: Let's think step by step. We can start by using the formula: distance = rate x time. Let's call the time it takes for the trains to meet \"t\". Train A travels at 35 miles per hour, so in time \"t\", it will travel a distance of 35t. Train B travels at 25 miles per hour, so in time \"t\", it will travel a distance of 25t. Since the trains are traveling towards each other, the total distance they will cover is 480 miles. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 35t + 25t = 480 Simplifying: 60t = 480 t = 8 So the trains will meet 8 hours after they started, which would be at 9:00 PM. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 9:00 PM. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Two stations A and B are 110 km apart on a straight line. One train starts from A at 7 a.m. and travels towards B at 20 kmph. Another train starts from B at 8 a.m. and travels towards A at a speed of 25 kmph. At what time will they meet? Answer Choices: (A) 39 (B) 10 (C) 88 (D) 12 (E) 18\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much distance the first train covers before the second train starts. The first train starts at 7 a.m. and the second train starts at 8 a.m., which means the first train has a one-hour head start. In one hour, the first train covers a distance of 20 km. Now, let's assume that the two trains meet after t hours. In that case, the second train would have traveled for t - 1 hours. Let's use the formula: distance = speed x time Distance covered by the first train + Distance covered by the second train = Total distance between the two stations 20t + 25(t-1) = 110 Simplifying the equation, we get: 45t = 135 t = 3 Therefore, the two trains will meet after 3 hours. The first train started at 7 a.m., so it will meet the second train at 10 a.m. Hence, the correct answer is (B) 10. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Two trains of equal lengths take 10 sec and 15 sec respectively to cross a telegraph post. If the length of each train be 120 m, in what time will they cross other travelling in opposite direction? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 12 (C) 13 (D) 14 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. The total distance covered by both trains when they cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is 240 meters. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds, since they are travelling in opposite directions. Let's call this speed \"v\". We know that the first train takes 10 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/10 = 12 m/s. Similarly, the second train takes 15 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/15 = 8 m/s. Therefore, the relative speed of the two trains is v = 12 + 8 = 20 m/s. To find the time it takes for the two trains to cross each other, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed Plugging in the values we know, we get: time = 240 / 20 = 12 seconds Therefore, the answer is (B) 12. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Two trains 110 m and 160 m long run at the speed of 60 km/hr and 40 km/hr respectively in opposite directions on parallel tracks. The time which they take to cross each other is? Answer Choices: (A) 10.9 (B) 10.7 (C) 10.3 (D) 10.8 (E) 9.72\nA: Let's think step by step. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds, which is 60 + 40 = 100 km/hr. We need to convert this to meters per second (m/s) to match the units of the lengths of the trains. We know that 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s, so: 100 km/hr = (100 x 5/18) m/s = 250/9 m/s Now we can use the formula: time = distance / speed The distance that the two trains need to cover to cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is 110 + 160 = 270 m. Plugging in the values, we get: time = 270 / (250/9) = 10.8 seconds Therefore, the answer is (D) 10.8. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
