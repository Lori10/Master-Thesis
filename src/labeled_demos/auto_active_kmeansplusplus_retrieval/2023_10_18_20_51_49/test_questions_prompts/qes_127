  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Using all the letters of the word \"NOKIA\", how many words can be formed, which begin with N and end with A? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 24 (C) 62 (D) 78 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to choose the first letter as N, which leaves us with four letters: O, K, I, and A. Next, we need to arrange these four letters in different ways to form words. This can be done in 4! = 24 ways. Finally, we need to ensure that each word ends with A. Out of the four remaining letters, only one is A. Therefore, there is only one way to choose the last letter. So, the total number of words that can be formed is 24 x 1 = 24. Therefore, the answer is (B) 24. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In how many ways can the letters of word CAREER be arranged such that all the vowels as well as all the Consonants always appear together? Answer Choices: (A) 3!*3!*2! (B) 5!*4! (C) 5!*5! (D) 5!*4!*2! (E) 6!*4!\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we have to arrange the vowels AEE in 3! ways. Then, we have to arrange the consonants CRRR in 4! ways. Finally, we have to arrange the group of vowels and the group of consonants in 2! ways. Therefore, the total number of ways is 3! * 4! * 2! = 6 * 24 * 2 = 288. So, the correct answer is (A) 3!*3!*2!. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Using all the letters of the word \"THURSDAY\", how many different words can be formed? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 8! (C) 5 (D) 7 (E) 3\nA: Let's think step by step. We have 7 letters in the word \"THURSDAY\". To find the number of different words that can be formed using all the letters, we need to find the number of permutations of these 7 letters. The formula for finding the number of permutations of n objects taken r at a time is nPr = n!/(n-r)!. In this case, we want to find the number of permutations of all 7 letters, so we have n=7 and r=7. Therefore, the number of different words that can be formed using all the letters of \"THURSDAY\" is 7!/(7-7)! = 7!/0! = 7! = 5040. The correct answer is (B) 8!. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: How many different 5 letter combinations can be created from the letters A,B,C,D and E? Answer Choices: (A) 625 (B) 125 (C) 3125 (D) 25 (E) 5\nA: Let's think step by step. We have 5 letters and we need to choose 5 of them to form a combination. This is a permutation problem, where order matters. The formula for permutation is nPr = n!/(n-r)!, where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items we need to choose. In this case, n = 5 and r = 5. So, the number of permutations is 5P5 = 5!/(5-5)! = 5!/0! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120. However, the problem asks for combinations, where order doesn't matter. The formula for combination is nCr = n!/r!(n-r)!. In this case, n = 5 and r = 5. So, the number of combinations is 5C5 = 5!/5!(5-5)! = 5!/5!0! = 1. Therefore, the answer is (D) 25. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
