  "test_question": "Q: At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle? Answer Choices: (A) 50 m (B) 75 m (C) 100 m (D) 125 m (E) 150 m",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A train 440 meters long is running with a speed of 50 kmph. The time taken by it to cross a tunnel 180 meters long is? Answer Choices: (A) 40.33 sec (B) 41.33 sec (C) 42.33 sec (D) 40 sec (E) 44.64 sec\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed from kmph to m/s. 50 kmph = (50 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 13.89 m/s Now, we can find the time taken by the train to cross the tunnel and the train together. Total distance to be covered = length of train + length of tunnel = 440 + 180 = 620 meters Time taken = distance / speed = 620 / 13.89 = 44.64 seconds Therefore, the answer is (E) 44.64 sec. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A train is 320 meter long is running at a speed of 45 km/hour. In what time will it pass a bridge of 140 meter length? Answer Choices: (A) 11 seconds (B) 38 seconds (C) 40 seconds (D) 88 seconds (E) 36.8 seconds\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed from km/hour to m/s. 45 km/hour = (45 * 1000) / (60 * 60) m/s = 12.5 m/s Next, we need to find the total distance the train will cover when passing the bridge. Total distance = length of train + length of bridge = 320 + 140 = 460 meters Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed time = 460 / 12.5 = 36.8 seconds Therefore, the answer is (E) 36.8 seconds. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A train running at the speed of 60 km/hr crosses a pole in 6 seconds. What is the length of the train? Answer Choices: (A) 120 metres (B) 180 metres (C) 324 metres (D) 100 metres (E) 180 metres\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that the train crosses a pole in 6 seconds. This means that the length of the train is equal to the distance it covers in 6 seconds at a speed of 60 km/hr. First, we need to convert the speed from km/hr to m/s. 60 km/hr = (60 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 16.67 m/s (rounded off to two decimal places) Now, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time distance = 16.67 m/s x 6 s = 100.02 meters (rounded off to two decimal places) Therefore, the length of the train is 100 meters. The correct answer is (D) 100 metres. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A train running at the speed of 60 km/hr crosses a pole in 15 seconds. What is the length of the train? Answer Choices: (A) 187 m (B) 250 m (C) 876 m (D) 150 m (E) 267 m\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that the train crosses a pole in 15 seconds. This means that the length of the train plus the length of the front and back gaps (if any) is equal to the distance covered by the train in 15 seconds. We need to convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s, as the time given is in seconds and the answer choices are in meters. 60 km/hr = (60 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 16.67 m/s Let's assume that there are no front or back gaps. Distance covered by the train in 15 seconds = speed x time = 16.67 x 15 = 250.05 meters Therefore, the length of the train is 250 meters. The correct answer is (B) 250 m. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
