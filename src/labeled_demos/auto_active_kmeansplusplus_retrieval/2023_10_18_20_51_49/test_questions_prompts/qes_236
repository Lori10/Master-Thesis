  "test_question": "Q: If a man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph, then the man's rate along the current is: Answer Choices: (A) 15 kmph (B) 6 kmph (C) 12 kmph (D) 14 kmph (E) 6 kmph",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A man can row at 5 kmph in still water. If the velocity of current is 1 kmph and it takes him 2 hour to row to a place and come back, how far is the place? Answer Choices: (A) 2.4 km (B) 4.8 km (C) 3.4 km (D) 4.4 km (E) 5.6 km\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the distance to the place be 'd' km. When the man rows to the place, he is rowing against the current, so his effective speed is 5 - 1 = 4 kmph. When he rows back from the place, he is rowing with the current, so his effective speed is 5 + 1 = 6 kmph. We know that time taken to row to the place and come back is 2 hours. Using the formula: time = distance / speed We can write two equations: d / 4 + d / 6 = 2 Simplifying this equation, we get: 3d + 2d = 24 5d = 24 d = 4.8 km Therefore, the answer is (B) 4.8 km. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A man can row his boat with the stream at 18 km/h and against the stream in 8 km/h. The man's rate is? Answer Choices: (A) 5 kmph (B) 2 kmph (C) 7 kmph (D) 8 kmph (E) 3 kmph\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the speed of the stream be x km/h and the speed of the man be y km/h. When the man rows with the stream, his effective speed is (y + x) km/h. When the man rows against the stream, his effective speed is (y - x) km/h. We are given that: (y + x) = 18 km/h (y - x) = 8 km/h Adding the two equations, we get: 2y = 26 km/h y = 13 km/h Therefore, the man's rate is 13 km/h. The answer is not in the given options. Hence, the answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A person can swim in still water at 8 km/h. If the speed of water 4 km/h, how many hours will the man take to swim back against the current for 8km? Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 6 (E) 7\nA: Let's think step by step. The speed of the person in still water is 8 km/h. The speed of the water is 4 km/h. When the person swims with the current, their effective speed is the sum of their speed in still water and the speed of the water. So, their effective speed is 8 + 4 = 12 km/h. When the person swims against the current, their effective speed is the difference between their speed in still water and the speed of the water. So, their effective speed is 8 - 4 = 4 km/h. We know that the person needs to swim 8 km against the current. To find how long it will take, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed In this case, the distance is 8 km and the speed is 4 km/h. So: time = 8 / 4 = 2 Therefore, the person will take 2 hours to swim back against the current for 8 km. The correct answer is (A) 2. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The speed at which a man can row a boat in still water is 15 kmph. If he rows downstream, where the speed of current is 3 kmph, what time will he take to cover 60 metres? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 15 (C) 20 (D) 12 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the speed of the boat downstream. We can do this by adding the speed of the boat in still water (15 kmph) to the speed of the current (3 kmph). Speed downstream = 15 kmph + 3 kmph = 18 kmph Next, we need to convert the distance given (60 meters) into kilometers. 60 meters = 0.06 kilometers Now we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 0.06 km / 18 kmph Time = 0.0033 hours Finally, we need to convert hours to minutes by multiplying by 60: Time = 0.0033 hours * 60 minutes/hour Time = 0.2 minutes Therefore, the answer is (C) 20. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
