  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If Q is a positive integer, which of the following must be odd? Answer Choices: (A) Q+1 (B) Q^2+Q (C) Q^2+Q+1 (D) x^2\u22121 (E) 3x^2\u22123\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine which expressions are odd. An odd number is any integer that cannot be divided evenly by 2. (A) Q+1: If Q is odd, then Q+1 is even. If Q is even, then Q+1 is odd. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Q+1 is odd or even. (B) Q^2+Q: We can factor out Q from this expression to get Q(Q+1). Since Q is a positive integer, Q+1 is also a positive integer. Therefore, Q(Q+1) is the product of two consecutive integers, one of which must be even. Therefore, Q(Q+1) is always even. (C) Q^2+Q+1: We can rewrite this expression as (Q+1)^2 - Q. Since (Q+1)^2 is always odd (the square of an odd number is odd), and subtracting an odd number from an odd number results in an even number, Q^2+Q+1 is always odd. (D) x^2-1: We can factor this expression as (x+1)(x-1). Since x is a positive integer, x+1 and x-1 are consecutive integers. One of these must be even, and the other must be odd. Therefore, (x+1)(x-1) is always even. (E) 3x^2-3: We can factor out 3 from this expression to get 3(x^2-1). Since x^2-1 is always even (as shown in option D), 3(x^2-1) is always a multiple of 3, but not necessarily odd. Therefore, the answer is (C) Q^2+Q+1. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: if integer N has p factors ; how many factors will 5N have ? Answer Choices: (A) p (B) 2p (C) P+1 (D) 2p+1 (E) Cannot be determined\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that N has p factors. This means that N can be written as a product of p distinct prime numbers raised to various powers. For example, if N = 12, then N can be written as 2^2 * 3^1, which means that N has (2+1) * (1+1) = 6 factors (2 and 3 can each be raised to 0, 1, or 2). Now, let's consider 5N. 5N can be written as 5 * N, which means that 5N has one more factor than N (since 5 is a prime factor of 5N that wasn't present in N). Therefore, the answer is (C) p+1. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If a, b, and c are consecutive odd positive integers and a<b<c, which of the following must be true?\nI. at least one of the three numbers is prime\nII. ab>c\nIII. a + b + c = 3b Answer Choices: (A) III only (B) I and II only (C) I and III only (D) II and III only (E) I, II, and III\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We are given that a, b, and c are consecutive odd positive integers and a<b<c. This means that a = b-2 and c = b+2. Now we can use this information to check the answer choices: I. At least one of the three numbers is prime: This is not necessarily true. For example, if a = 3, b = 5, and c = 7, then none of the numbers are prime. II. ab>c: We can substitute a and c in terms of b to get ab > (b+2).b or ab > b^2 + 2b. Since b is odd, we can write b = 2n+1 for some integer n. Substituting this in the inequality, we get (2n+1)(2n+3) > 4n^2 + 6n + 1 or 4n^2 + 8n + 3 > 4n^2 + 6n + 1, which is true for all n. Therefore, this statement is true. III. a + b + c = 3b: Substituting a and c in terms of b, we get (b-2) + b + (b+2) = 3b or 3b = 3b. This statement is also true. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) II and III only. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If y is the smallest positive integer such that 6300 multiplied by y is the square of an integer, then y must be Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 7 (C) 15 (D) 35 (E) 45\nA: Let's think step by step. We need to find the smallest positive integer y such that 6300 multiplied by y is the square of an integer. Let's factor 6300: 6300 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2 * 7 To be a perfect square, each prime factor must have an even exponent. Therefore, we need to add one factor of 7 to make the exponent of 7 even. So, y = 7. Therefore, the answer is (B) 7. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
