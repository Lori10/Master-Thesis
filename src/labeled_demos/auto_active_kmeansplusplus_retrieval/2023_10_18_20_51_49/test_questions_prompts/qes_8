  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Calculate how many men are needed to finish a specific task in 5 days if it will take 15 men to complete the same task in 10 days. ? Answer Choices: (A) 13 (B) 16 (C) 35 (D) 25 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the formula: (number of men) x (number of days) = (amount of work) Let's call the number of men needed to finish the task in 5 days \"x\". So we have: x * 5 = 15 * 10 Simplifying: x = 30 Therefore, 30 men are needed to finish the task in 5 days. Answer: None of the above (not one of the answer choices is 30). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: 15 men take 20 days of 8 hours each to do a piece of work. How many days of 6 hours each would 21 women take to do the same. If 3 women do as much work as 2 men? Answer Choices: (A) 27.57 (B) 28.57 (C) 29.57 (D) 30.57 (E) 32\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total work done by 15 men in 20 days of 8 hours each. 15 men take 20 days of 8 hours each to do a piece of work. So, the total work done by 15 men = 15 * 20 * 8 = 2400 man-hours. Step 2: Find the work done by 1 man in 1 hour. The work done by 1 man in 1 hour = Total work done by 15 men / (15 * 20) = 2400 / 300 = 8 man-hours. Step 3: Find the work done by 1 woman in 1 hour. 3 women do as much work as 2 men. So, the work done by 1 woman in 1 hour = Work done by 2 men in 1 hour / 3 = 2 * 8 / 3 = 16 / 3 woman-hours. Step 4: Find the total work done by 21 women in x days of 6 hours each. Let the total work done by 21 women in x days of 6 hours each be y woman-hours. So, y = 21 * x * 6 * (16 / 3) = 672x woman-hours. Step 5: Equate the work done by 15 men and 21 women. 2400 man-hours = 672x woman-hours. x = 2400 / (672 * (16 / 3)) = 30.57 days. Therefore, the answer is (D) 30.57. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A work which could be finished in 10 days was finished 3 days earlier after 10 more men joined. The number of men employed was? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 20 (C) 88 (D) 71 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the number of men initially employed be x. Then, the work done in 1 day by x men is 1/10 and the work done in 1 day by (x+10) men is 1/(10-3) = 1/7 (since the work was finished 3 days earlier). Now, we can set up an equation based on the work done by x men and (x+10) men: x/10 + (x+10)/7 = 1 Multiplying both sides by 70 (the least common multiple of 10 and 7) gives: 7x + 10(x+10) = 70 Simplifying and solving for x gives: 17x = 60 x = 60/17 Since x is not a whole number, none of the answer choices are correct. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: A, B can Complete a work in 15 days &10 days respectively. They started doing thework together after 2 days B had to leave and A alone completed the remaining work.The whole work wascompleted in how many days? Answer Choices: (A) 8 days (B) 10 days (C) 12 days (D) 14 days (E) 16 days\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the total work is 150 units (LCM of 15 and 10). In one day, A can complete 10 units of work (150/15) and B can complete 15 units of work (150/10). Together, in one day, they can complete 25 units of work (10+15). After 2 days, the total work completed by A and B together is 50 units (25*2). So, the remaining work is 100 units (150-50). Now, A alone has to complete 100 units of work. In one day, A can complete 10 units of work. Therefore, A will take 10 days to complete the remaining work (100/10). So, the total number of days taken to complete the work is 2+10 = 12 days. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 12 days. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
