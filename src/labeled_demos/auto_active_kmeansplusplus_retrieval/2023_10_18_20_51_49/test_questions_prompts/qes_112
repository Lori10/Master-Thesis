  "test_question": "Q: A box contains a certain number of balls, marked successively from 1 to n. If there are 45 different ways that two balls can be selected from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, then what is the value of n? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 10 (C) 9 (D) 8 (E) 7",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Amanda goes to the toy store to buy 1 ball and 3 different board games. If the toy store is stocked with 3 types of balls and 6 types of board games, how many different selections E of the 4 items can Amanda make? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 12 (C) 14 (D) 15 (E) 60\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Amanda can choose 1 ball out of 3 types of balls. This can be done in 3 ways. Next, she can choose 3 board games out of 6 types of board games. This can be done in 6C3 ways, which is equal to 20. Therefore, the total number of different selections E of the 4 items that Amanda can make is 3 x 20 = 60. So, the correct answer is (E) 60. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A student must answer 7 out of 10 questions on an examination. If at least 3 of the first 5 questions must be answered, how many possible combinations of 7 questions are available to the student?\n. Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 80 (C) 110 (D) 220 (E) 360\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that the student must answer 7 out of 10 questions, so we need to find the number of ways to choose 7 questions out of 10. This can be calculated using the combination formula: 10C7 = 10! / (7! * 3!) = 120 So there are 120 possible combinations of 7 questions. Step 2: We also know that at least 3 of the first 5 questions must be answered. This means that the student can either answer 3, 4, or 5 questions from the first 5. Step 3: We need to find the number of ways to choose the remaining questions from the remaining 5. This can be calculated using the combination formula: 5C4 + 5C3 + 5C2 = 5! / (4! * 1!) + 5! / (3! * 2!) + 5! / (2! * 3!) = 5 + 10 + 10 = 25 So there are 25 ways to choose the remaining questions. Step 4: We can now find the total number of possible combinations by multiplying the results from step 2 and step 3: (3C3 * 5C4) + (4C3 * 5C3) + (5C3 * 5C2) = (1 * 5) + (4 * 10) + (10 * 10) = 5 + 40 + 100 = 145 Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the correct answer of 145. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The number of sequences in which 5 players can throw a ball, so that the youngest player may not be the last is ? Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 96 (C) 8 (D) 62 (E) 10\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of sequences in which 5 players can throw a ball. This can be calculated as 5! (5 factorial) which is equal to 120. Next, we need to find the number of sequences in which the youngest player is the last. In this case, we can fix the youngest player in the last position and arrange the remaining 4 players in 4! ways. So, the number of sequences in which the youngest player is the last is 4!. Therefore, the number of sequences in which the youngest player may not be the last is the difference between the total number of sequences and the number of sequences in which the youngest player is the last. This is equal to 120 - 4! = 120 - 24 = 96. Hence, the correct answer is (B) 96. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In how many ways can a group of 3 men and 3 women be made out of a total of 7 men and 4 women? Answer Choices: (A) 163 (B) 167 (C) 130 (D) 174 (E) 180\nA: Let's think step by step. We need to select 3 men out of 7 men and 3 women out of 4 women. The number of ways to select 3 men out of 7 men is 7C3 = (7*6*5)/(3*2*1) = 35. The number of ways to select 3 women out of 4 women is 4C3 = (4*3*2)/(3*2*1) = 4. The total number of ways to select 3 men and 3 women out of 7 men and 4 women is the product of the above two values, i.e., 35*4 = 140. Therefore, the correct answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the calculated value of 140. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
