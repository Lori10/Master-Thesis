  "formatted_prompt": "Q: What amount does Kiran get if he invests Rs. 18000 at 15% p.a. simple interest for four years? Answer Choices: (A) 28800 (B) 24800 (C) 24400 (D) 20000 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. The formula for simple interest is: Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100 Here, Principal = Rs. 18000, Rate = 15% p.a. and Time = 4 years. Substituting the values in the formula, we get: Simple Interest = (18000 * 15 * 4) / 100 Simple Interest = 10800 Therefore, Kiran will get Rs. 10800 as simple interest for four years. Now, to find the total amount he will get at the end of four years, we need to add the simple interest to the principal amount. Total Amount = Principal + Simple Interest Total Amount = 18000 + 10800 Total Amount = 28800 Therefore, Kiran will get Rs. 28800 if he invests Rs. 18000 at 15% p.a. simple interest for four years. Hence, the correct answer is (A) 28800. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A and B invests Rs.8000 and Rs.9000 in a business. After 4 months, A withdraws half of his capital and 2 months later, B withdraws one-third of his capital. In what ratio should they share the profits at the end of the year? Answer Choices: (A) 32:45 (B) 32:37 (C) 32:41 (D) 32:47 (E) 32:48\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. Let the total profit be x. A invests Rs.8000 and B invests Rs.9000. After 4 months, A withdraws half of his capital, which means he withdraws Rs.4000. So, A's investment for the remaining 8 months is Rs.4000. B does not withdraw any amount after 4 months. After 6 months (2 months after A's withdrawal), B withdraws one-third of his capital, which means he withdraws Rs.3000. So, B's investment for the remaining 6 months is Rs.6000. Now, let's calculate the ratio of their investments for the entire year. A's investment for the year = (4/12)*8000 + (8/12)*4000 = 2667 + 2667 = 5334 B's investment for the year = (6/12)*9000 + (6/12)*6000 = 4500 + 3000 = 7500 Therefore, the ratio of their investments for the entire year is 5334:7500, which simplifies to 32:45. Hence, the answer is (A) 32:45. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A and B invests Rs.2500 and Rs.4000 respectively in a business. If A doubles his capital after 6 months. In what ratio should A and B divide that year's profit? Answer Choices: (A) 11:5 (B) 15:16 (C) 15:2 (D) 9:9 (E) 11:1\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total investment made by A and B. Total investment = Rs.2500 + Rs.4000 = Rs.6500 After 6 months, A doubles his capital. So, his new investment becomes Rs.5000. Now, the ratio of their investments is: A:B = Rs.5000 : Rs.4000 = 5:4 Let's assume that the total profit for the year is Rs.X. A's share of profit = (5/9) X B's share of profit = (4/9) X Therefore, the ratio in which they should divide the profit is: A:B = (5/9) X : (4/9) X = 5:4 So, the correct answer is (D) 9:9. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Mike invested Rs. 3750 in a scheme for 3 years at compound interest rate 6.5% p.a. How much amount will Mike get on maturity of the fixed deposit? Answer Choices: (A) s.4581.29 (B) s.4450 (C) s.4500 (D) s.4500.25 (E) s.4529.81\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the formula for compound interest to solve this problem: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) Where: A = the amount at the end of the investment P = the principal amount (initial investment) r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal) n = the number of times the interest is compounded per year t = the time period of the investment (in years) Plugging in the given values, we get: A = 3750(1 + 0.065/1)^(1*3) A = 3750(1.065)^3 A = 3750(1.207) A = 4522.50 Therefore, the closest answer choice is (E) s.4529.81. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
