  "test_question": "Q: When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet. Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 1120 (C) 792 (D) 1320 (E) 1200",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The sides of a rectangular region measured to the nearest centimeter are 8 cm and 5 cm. Out of the following which is the largest possible value of actual area of rectangle ? Answer Choices: (A) 48 (B) 55.25 (C) 52.29 (D) 44 (E) 41.25\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that the actual length and width of the rectangle must be somewhere between 7.5 cm and 8.5 cm for the 8 cm measurement, and between 4.5 cm and 5.5 cm for the 5 cm measurement. To find the largest possible area, we want to use the largest possible length and width within these ranges. The largest possible length is 8.5 cm and the largest possible width is 5.5 cm. So, the largest possible area is 8.5 cm x 5.5 cm = 46.75 cm^2. Out of the given answer choices, the closest one to 46.75 is (D) 44. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 44. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: What is the perimeter, in meters, of a rectangular garden 24 meters wide that has the same area as a rectangular playground 16 meters long and 12 meters wide? Answer Choices: (A) 48 (B) 56 (C) 64 (D) 76 (E) 192\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the area of the playground: Area = length x width = 16 x 12 = 192 square meters Since the garden has the same area, its length must be: Length = Area / width = 192 / 24 = 8 meters Now we can calculate the perimeter of the garden: Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 2(8 + 24) = 2(32) = 64 meters Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 64. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A wire in the form of a circle of radius 3.5 m is bent in the form of a rectangule, whose length and breadth are in the ratio of 6 : 5. What is the area of the rectangle? Answer Choices: (A) 70 cm2 (B) 30 cm2 (C) 66 cm2 (D) 55 cm2 (E) 54 cm2\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length and breadth of the rectangle. Let the length be 6x and the breadth be 5x. The perimeter of the circle is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle. Perimeter of circle = 2\u03c0r = 2\u03c0(3.5) = 7\u03c0 Perimeter of rectangle = 2(6x + 5x) = 22x So, 22x = 7\u03c0 x = 7\u03c0/22 Now, length = 6x = 6(7\u03c0/22) = 21\u03c0/11 Breadth = 5x = 5(7\u03c0/22) = 35\u03c0/22 Area of rectangle = length x breadth = (21\u03c0/11) x (35\u03c0/22) = 735\u03c0^2/242 This is approximately equal to 76.2 m^2. None of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: A man cycles round the boundary of a rectangular park at the rate of 12 kmph and completes one full round in 8 minutes. If the ratio between the length and breadth of the park be 3:2, then its area is: Answer Choices: (A) 1536m2 (B) 15360m2 (C) 153600m2 (D) 163600m2 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular park. Let the length and breadth of the park be 3x and 2x respectively (as given in the ratio 3:2). Perimeter of the park = 2(Length + Breadth) = 2(3x + 2x) = 10x Now, we know that the man cycles round the park at the rate of 12 kmph. In 1 hour, he covers a distance of 12 km. In 1 minute, he covers a distance of 12/60 = 0.2 km = 200 m. In 8 minutes, he covers a distance of 200 x 8 = 1600 m = 1.6 km. We also know that in 8 minutes, he completes one full round of the park. Therefore, 10x = 1.6 km x = 160 m Length of the park = 3x = 480 m Breadth of the park = 2x = 320 m Area of the park = Length x Breadth = 480 x 320 = 153600 m\u00b2 Hence, the correct answer is (C) 153600m\u00b2. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
