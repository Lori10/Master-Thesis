If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator? Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Excluding stoppages, the speed of a train is 54 kmph and including stoppages it is 36 kmph. Of how many minutes does the train stop per hour? Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 17 (C) 15 (D) 18 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the train stops for x minutes per hour. When the train is running without any stoppages, its speed is 54 kmph. When the train is running with stoppages, its speed is 36 kmph. We know that, Speed = Distance/Time Let's assume that the distance covered by the train is 1 km. When the train is running without any stoppages, the time taken to cover 1 km is: Time = Distance/Speed = 1/54 hours = 60/54 minutes = 20/18 minutes When the train is running with stoppages, the time taken to cover 1 km is: Time = Distance/Speed = 1/36 hours = 60/36 minutes = 10/6 minutes We know that the difference in time is due to the time spent in stoppages. Therefore, time spent in stoppages for covering 1 km = (20/18) - (10/6) = (20 - 30)/18 = -10/18 hours We can convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60. Time spent in stoppages for covering 1 km = (-10/18) * 60 = -100/18 minutes This is a negative value, which means that the train is not stopping at all. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A train is 320 meter long is running at a speed of 45 km/hour. In what time will it pass a bridge of 140 meter length? Answer Choices: (A) 11 seconds (B) 38 seconds (C) 40 seconds (D) 88 seconds (E) 36.8 seconds\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed from km/hour to m/s. 45 km/hour = (45 * 1000) / (60 * 60) m/s = 12.5 m/s Next, we need to find the total distance the train will cover when passing the bridge. Total distance = length of train + length of bridge = 320 + 140 = 460 meters Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed time = 460 / 12.5 = 36.8 seconds Therefore, the answer is (E) 36.8 seconds. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A train 160 m long is running at a speed of 45 km/hr. In what time will it pass a bridge 140 m long? Answer Choices: (A) 40 sec (B) 50 sec (C) 44 sec (D) 24 sec (E) 60 sec\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed from km/hr to m/s. 45 km/hr = (45 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 12.5 m/s Next, we need to find the total distance the train needs to cover to pass the bridge. Total distance = length of train + length of bridge = 160 + 140 = 300 m Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed time = 300 / 12.5 = 24 sec Therefore, the answer is (D) 24 sec. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: An elevator starts with 5 pasengers and stops at 8 different floors of the house. Find out the probability of all the 5 passengers alighting at different floors. Answer Choices: (A) 90 / 512 (B) 105 / 512 (C) 15/512 (D) 30/512 (E) 48/512\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 8 floors and 5 passengers, so the first passenger has 8 choices of floors to get off at. The second passenger has 7 choices of floors left, the third passenger has 6 choices, the fourth passenger has 5 choices, and the last passenger has 4 choices. Therefore, the total number of ways that the passengers can get off at different floors is: 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 = 6,720 Now, we need to find the total number of ways that the passengers can get off at any floor. This is simply: 8^5 = 32,768 So, the probability of all the passengers getting off at different floors is: 6,720 / 32,768 = 105 / 512 Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 105 / 512. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
