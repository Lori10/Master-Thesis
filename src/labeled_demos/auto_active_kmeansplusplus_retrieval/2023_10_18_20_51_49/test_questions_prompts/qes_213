  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The speed of a car increases by 2 kms after every one hour. If the distance travelling in the first one hour was 35 kms. what was the total distance travelled in 12 hours? Answer Choices: (A) 456 kms (B) 482 kms (C) 552 kms (D) 556 kms (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. After the first hour, the car would have travelled 35 + 2 = 37 kms. After the second hour, the car would have travelled 37 + 2 = 39 kms. Similarly, after the third hour, the car would have travelled 41 kms, after the fourth hour, it would have travelled 43 kms, and so on. So, after 12 hours, the car would have travelled a total distance of: 35 + 37 + 39 + ... + 47 + 49 = (12/2) * (35 + 49) = 12 * 42 = 504 kms Therefore, the correct answer is (E) None of these, as none of the given options match the calculated answer. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: There is a train and car. The ratio between the speed of a train & a car is 24:19 respectively. Also, a bus covered a distance of 320 km in 5 hours. The speed of the bus is 2/3rd of the speed of the train. How many kilometers will the car cover in 4 hours? Answer Choices: (A) 276 (B) 290 (C) 304 (D) 318 (E) 332\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find the speed of the train. Let the speed of the car be x km/hr. Then, the speed of the train will be (24/19)x km/hr. Given, the speed of the bus is 2/3rd of the speed of the train. So, the speed of the bus will be (2/3)(24/19)x = (16/19)x km/hr. Now, we know that the bus covered a distance of 320 km in 5 hours. So, its speed is 320/5 = 64 km/hr. Equating the speed of the bus, we get (16/19)x = 64. Solving for x, we get x = 76 km/hr. Therefore, the speed of the train is (24/19)(76) = 96 km/hr. Now, we need to find the distance covered by the car in 4 hours. Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time. Distance covered by the car in 4 hours = (76 \u00d7 4) = 304 km. Hence, the answer is (C) 304. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A car covers a distance of 624 km in 2 2/5 hours. Find its speed? Answer Choices: (A) 104 kmph (B) 194 kmph (C) 109 kmph (D) 260 kmph (E) 271 kmph\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that speed = distance/time. Here, the distance covered by the car is 624 km and the time taken is 2 2/5 hours. To convert the mixed fraction to an improper fraction, we can multiply the whole number (2) by the denominator (5) and add the numerator (2) to get 12/5. So, time taken = 12/5 hours. Now, we can substitute these values in the formula: Speed = distance/time Speed = 624/(12/5) Speed = 624 * 5/12 Speed = 260 kmph Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 260 kmph. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: There is a train and car. The ratio btw the speed of a train & a car is 16:15 respectively. Also, a bus covered a distance of 480km in 8h. The speed of the bus is 3/4th of the speed of the train. How much distance will the car cover in 6h? Answer Choices: (A) 300 km (B) 400 km (C) 420 km (D) 430 km (E) 450 km\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the speed of the train. Let's assume the speed of the car is x km/h. Then, the speed of the train will be (16/15)x km/h (as given in the ratio). Next, we are given that the speed of the bus is 3/4th of the speed of the train. So, the speed of the bus will be (3/4)(16/15)x = (4/5)x km/h. We know that the bus covered a distance of 480 km in 8 hours. So, its speed is 480/8 = 60 km/h. Equating the speed of the bus to (4/5)x, we get: (4/5)x = 60 x = (5/4) * 60 x = 75 So, the speed of the car is 75 km/h. Now, we need to find how much distance the car will cover in 6 hours. We can use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time Distance covered by the car in 6 hours = 75 * 6 = 450 km Therefore, the answer is (E) 450 km. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
