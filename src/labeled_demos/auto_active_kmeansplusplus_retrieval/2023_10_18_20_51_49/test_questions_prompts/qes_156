Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A pump can fill a tank with water in 2 hours. Because of a leak, it took 2 hours to fill the tank. The leak can drain all the water of the tank in: Answer Choices: (A) 4 hours (B) 7 hours (C) 8 hours (D) 14 hours (E) 15 hours\nA: Let's think step by step. The pump can fill the tank in 2 hours, so in 1 hour it can fill 1/2 of the tank. Let's assume the leak can drain the entire tank in x hours. In 2 hours, the pump fills the entire tank, but during this time the leak also drains some water. Let's say the leak drains 1/2 of the tank in 2 hours. So, in 2 hours, the pump fills 1/2 of the tank and the leak drains 1/2 of the tank. This means that the net amount of water added to the tank in 2 hours is 0. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 1/2 - 1/x = 0 Solving for x, we get: 1/x = 1/2 x = 2 Therefore, the leak can drain the entire tank in 2 hours. The correct answer is (A) 4 hours. None of the given options match the correct answer. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Two pipes A and B can fill a cistern in 10 and 15 minutes respectively. Both fill pipes are opened together,but at the end of 3 minutes, \u2018B\u2019 is turned off. How much time will the cistern take to fill ? Answer Choices: (A) 6 min (B) 8 min (C) 10 min (D) 12 min (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the capacity of the cistern is 'x' liters. In one minute, pipe A can fill 1/10th of the cistern, and pipe B can fill 1/15th of the cistern. When both pipes are opened together, they can fill 1/10 + 1/15 = 1/6th of the cistern in one minute. After 3 minutes, the cistern would have been filled with 3/6th or 1/2 of its capacity. Now, only pipe A is filling the remaining 1/2 of the cistern. In one minute, pipe A can fill 1/10th of the cistern. Therefore, the time taken to fill the remaining 1/2 of the cistern by pipe A alone would be 1/2 \u00f7 1/10 = 5 minutes. Therefore, the total time taken to fill the cistern would be 3 + 5 = 8 minutes. Hence, the correct answer is option (B) 8 min. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Pipe A can fill the tank in 50 minutes and pipe B in 40min and pipe C can empty the tank in 2 hours. How long it will take to fill the tank if three of the pipes are operating together? Answer Choices: (A) 22.22 (B) 27.27 (C) 29.35 (D) 31.2 (E) 35.6\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the combined rate of filling of pipes A and B. Pipe A can fill the tank in 50 minutes, so its rate of filling is 1/50 of the tank per minute. Pipe B can fill the tank in 40 minutes, so its rate of filling is 1/40 of the tank per minute. Together, pipes A and B can fill the tank at a rate of (1/50 + 1/40) = 3/200 of the tank per minute. Now, we need to find the rate of emptying of pipe C. Pipe C can empty the tank in 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. So, its rate of emptying is 1/120 of the tank per minute. When all three pipes are operating together, the net rate of filling of the tank is the sum of the rates of filling of pipes A and B, minus the rate of emptying of pipe C. So, the net rate of filling of the tank is (3/200 - 1/120) = 1/300 of the tank per minute. To fill the entire tank, we need to do 1 job, which is filling the tank. Let's assume that it takes 'x' minutes to fill the tank when all three pipes are operating together. So, the equation becomes: 1/x = 1/300 Solving for x, we get: x = 300 minutes Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Five drainage pipes, each draining water from a pool at the same constant rate, together can drain a certain pool in 12 days. How many additional pipes, each draining water at the same constant rate, will be needed to drain the pool in 6 days? Answer Choices: (A)  5 (B)  9 (C)  10 (D)  12 (E)  15\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to understand that the rate of draining water is constant for each pipe. Let's say the rate of each pipe is x. We know that 5 pipes can drain the pool in 12 days. So, the total amount of water in the pool is 5x * 12 = 60x. Now, we want to drain the same pool in half the time, which is 6 days. So, the total amount of water drained should be the same, which is 60x. Let's say we need n additional pipes to drain the pool in 6 days. So, the total number of pipes will be 5 + n. We can use the formula: total amount of water drained = rate * time 60x = (5 + n) * x * 6 Simplifying this equation, we get: 60x = 30x + 6nx 30x = 6nx n = 5 Therefore, we need 5 additional pipes to drain the pool in 6 days. The answer is (A) 5. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
