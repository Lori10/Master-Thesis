  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A shopkeeper marks up the price of his goods by 20% and gives a discount of 10% to the customer. He also uses a 900g weight instead of 1Kg weight. Find his profit percentage. Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 12% (C) 20% (D) 30% (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume the cost price of the goods is $100. The shopkeeper marks up the price by 20%, so the selling price becomes $120. Next, the shopkeeper gives a discount of 10%, so the selling price becomes $108. Now, the shopkeeper uses a 900g weight instead of 1Kg weight. This means that the customer is paying for 100g less than what they think they are paying for. To calculate the profit percentage, we need to find the profit made by the shopkeeper. Profit = Selling price - Cost price Cost price = $100 (as assumed earlier) Selling price = $108 Profit = $108 - $100 = $8 Now, we need to calculate the profit percentage. Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost price) x 100 Profit percentage = (8 / 100) x 100 = 8% Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 8%. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A certain restaurant offers 7 kinds of cheese and 2 kinds of fruit for its dessert platter. If each dessert platter contains an equal number of kinds of cheese and kinds of fruit, how many different dessert platters could the restaurant offer? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 12 (C) 15 (D) 21 (E) 35\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 7 kinds of cheese and 2 kinds of fruit. To have an equal number of kinds of cheese and fruit, we need to find the common factors of 7 and 2. The only common factor is 1. Therefore, each dessert platter can have only 1 kind of cheese and 1 kind of fruit. To find the total number of different dessert platters, we need to multiply the number of options for cheese and fruit. There are 7 options for cheese and 2 options for fruit. Therefore, the total number of different dessert platters is 7 x 2 = 14. However, we need to divide this number by 2 because the order of cheese and fruit does not matter. Therefore, the final answer is 14/2 = 7. So, the correct answer is (A) 8. None of the given options match the correct answer. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Salad dressing P is made up of 30% vinegar and 70% oil, and salad dressing Q contains 10% vinegar and 90% oil. If the two dressings are combined to produce a salad dressing that is 12% vinegar, dressing P comprises what percentage of the new dressing? Answer Choices: (A) 50% (B) 40% (C) 30% (D) 20% (E) 10%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that we have 100 ml of the new salad dressing. Let x be the percentage of dressing P in the new dressing. Then, we can write: - The amount of vinegar in dressing P = 30% of x ml - The amount of vinegar in dressing Q = 10% of (100 - x) ml (since the total amount of dressing is 100 ml and we have x ml of dressing P) - The amount of vinegar in the new dressing = 12% of 100 ml = 12 ml Since we are combining the two dressings, the total amount of vinegar in the new dressing is the sum of the amount of vinegar in dressing P and dressing Q. So, we can write: 0.3x + 0.1(100 - x) = 12 Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.2x + 10 = 12 0.2x = 2 x = 10 Therefore, dressing P comprises 10% of the new dressing. The correct answer is (E) 10%. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: The total cars in a Garage is 1000 out of which 500 are made by Honda. Out of every 100 Honda cars, 90 are red in color, but only 50% of the total cars is red. Find the % of non-Honda cars that are red Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 20% (C) 30% (D) 25% (E) 15%\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of red cars. If 50% of the total cars are red, then the number of red cars is 50% of 1000, which is 500. Step 2: Find the number of red Honda cars. Out of every 100 Honda cars, 90 are red. So, out of 500 Honda cars, 90% are red, which is 450. Step 3: Find the number of non-Honda cars. The total number of cars is 1000, and 500 of them are Honda cars. So, the number of non-Honda cars is 1000 - 500, which is 500. Step 4: Find the number of non-Honda red cars. We know that there are 500 red cars in total, and 450 of them are red Honda cars. So, the number of non-Honda red cars is 500 - 450, which is 50. Step 5: Find the percentage of non-Honda red cars. Out of 500 non-Honda cars, 50 are red. So, the percentage of non-Honda red cars is (50/500) x 100, which is 10%. Therefore, the answer is (A) 10%. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
