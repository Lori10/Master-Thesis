  "test_question": "Q: All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If \"COMPUTER\" was given a code of 111, then what is the sum of \"VIRUS\" and \"WORM\"? Answer Choices: (A) 123 (B) 22 (C) 20 (D) 160 (E) 158\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine the code for \"VIRUS\" and \"WORM\". We are not given any information about the code for individual letters, so we cannot determine this directly. However, we do know that \"COMPUTER\" has a code of 111. We can use this information to try and find a relationship between the letters in \"COMPUTER\" and the letters in \"VIRUS\" and \"WORM\". One possible relationship is that the code for each letter in \"VIRUS\" and \"WORM\" is equal to the code for the corresponding letter in \"COMPUTER\" plus a certain constant. Let's call this constant \"k\". Using this relationship, we can set up two equations: V + k + I + k + R + k + U + k + S + k = ? W + k + O + k + R + k + M + k = ? We don't know the values of \"k\" or the sum of the codes, but we can simplify the equations by combining like terms: (5k + V + I + R + U + S) = ? (4k + W + O + R + M) = ? We still don't have enough information to solve for the sum of the codes, but we can use the fact that the sum of the codes is a multiple of 3 (since 111 is a multiple of 3). Looking at the simplified equations, we can see that the sum of the letters in \"VIRUS\" is 5 + V + I + R + U + S, which is odd (since 5 is odd). Therefore, the sum of the letters in \"WORM\" must be even in order for the sum of the codes to be a multiple of 3. The only answer choice that is even is (C) 20. Therefore, the answer is (C) 20. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In final exam of class IX there are 50 students 10 % students failed. How many students passed to class X? Answer Choices: (A) 33 (B) 378 (C) 37 (D) 39 (E) 45\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of students who failed the exam. 10% of 50 = (10/100) x 50 = 5 Step 2: Find the number of students who passed the exam. Total number of students - Number of students who failed = 50 - 5 = 45 Therefore, the answer is (E) 45. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: When 1/10 percent of 2,000 is subtracted from 1/10 of 2,000, the difference is Answer Choices: (A)  0 (B)  198 (C)  450 (D)  495 (E)  500\nA: Let's think step by step. 1/10 percent of 2,000 is equal to (1/10)*(1/100)*2,000 = 2. 1/10 of 2,000 is equal to 200. So, when we subtract 2 from 200, we get 198. Therefore, the answer is (B) 198. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A mailman puts .05% of letters in the wrong mailbox. How many deliveries must he make to misdeliver 2 items? Answer Choices: (A) 4000 (B) 400 (C) 40 (D) 40000 (E) 4500\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert .05% to a decimal, which is 0.0005. This represents the probability of a letter being misdelivered. Let's call the number of deliveries the mailman makes \"x\". We want to find the value of x that results in 2 misdelivered items. To set up the equation, we can use the formula for probability: probability = number of desired outcomes / total number of outcomes In this case, the desired outcome is 2 misdelivered items, and the total number of outcomes is the number of deliveries the mailman makes (x). So we can write: 0.0005x = 2 To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.0005: x = 2 / 0.0005 x = 4000 Therefore, the answer is (A) 4000. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
