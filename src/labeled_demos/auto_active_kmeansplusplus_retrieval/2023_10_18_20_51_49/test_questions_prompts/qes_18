  "test_question": "Q: A number is as much greater than 36 as is less than 86. Find the Number. Answer Choices: (A) 60 (B) 56 (C) 51 (D) 61 (E) 41",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: 56, 63, 59, 11, 57, 6, 11\nWhich of the following numbers is lower than the median but greater than the mean of the set of the numbers in the list? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 32 (C) 49 (D) 56 (E) 58\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the median of the set of numbers. To do this, we need to arrange the numbers in order from least to greatest: 6, 11, 11, 56, 57, 59, 63 The median is the middle number, which is 56. Next, we need to find the mean of the set of numbers: (6 + 11 + 11 + 56 + 57 + 59 + 63) / 7 = 38 So, we are looking for a number that is lower than 56 but greater than 38. Option (B) 32 is lower than both the median and the mean, so it is not the answer. Option (A) 21 is lower than both the median and the mean, so it is not the answer. Option (C) 49 is greater than the mean but also greater than the median, so it is not the answer. Option (D) 56 is equal to the median, so it is not the answer. Option (E) 58 is greater than the median, so it is not the answer. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In a single throw of a die, what is the probability of getting a number greater than 4? Answer Choices: (A) 1/2 (B) 1/3 (C) 2/3 (D) 1/4 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. There are six possible outcomes when a die is thrown, which are the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Out of these six outcomes, only two are greater than 4, which are 5 and 6. Therefore, the probability of getting a number greater than 4 is 2/6 or 1/3. So, the correct answer is (B) 1/3. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If x is 50 percent greater than 88, then x = Answer Choices: (A) 68 (B) 132 (C) 86 (D) 105.6 (E) 108\nA: Let's think step by step. If x is 50% greater than 88, that means x is equal to 88 plus 50% of 88. 50% of 88 is (50/100) * 88 = 44. So, x = 88 + 44 = 132. Therefore, the answer is (B) 132. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Which of the following values is the greatest Answer Choices: (A) a)  30% of 89 (B) b)  22% of 78 (C) c)  33% of 67 (D) d)  44% of 56 (E) e)  55% of 45\nA: Let's think step by step. A) 30% of 89 = 0.3 x 89 = 26.7 B) 22% of 78 = 0.22 x 78 = 17.16 C) 33% of 67 = 0.33 x 67 = 22.11 D) 44% of 56 = 0.44 x 56 = 24.64 E) 55% of 45 = 0.55 x 45 = 24.75 Therefore, the greatest value is option (E) 55% of 45. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
