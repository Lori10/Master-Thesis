  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If log5 x = 2, what is \u221ax? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 3\u221a2 (C) 2\u221a3 (D) 5\u221a3 (E) 3\u221a5\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that log5 x = 2. This means that 5 raised to the power of 2 is equal to x. So, x = 5^2 = 25. Now, we need to find the square root of x, which is \u221a25 = 5. Therefore, the answer is (A) 5. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: How many numbers from 2 to 8 are exactly divisible by 2? Answer Choices: (A) A) 2 (B) B) 4 (C) C) 5 (D) D) 7 (E) E) 8\nA: Let's think step by step. We need to find the numbers from 2 to 8 that are exactly divisible by 2. Divisible by 2 means that the number can be divided by 2 without leaving any remainder. The numbers from 2 to 8 are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Out of these, the numbers that are exactly divisible by 2 are: 2, 4, 6, 8. So, the answer is (B) 4. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: What is the value of 4^5+4^6? Answer Choices: (A)  5(4^5)  (B)  4^35 (C)  17(4^5)  (D)  8^12 (E)  7(4^5) \nA: Let's think step by step. We can simplify the expression by factoring out 4^5: 4^5 + 4^6 = 4^5(1 + 4) = 4^5(5) = 5(4^5) Therefore, the answer is (A) 5(4^5). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: (8^16)+(16^13)+(4^22) = ? Answer Choices: (A) (4) *(2^29+1)  (B) (6) *(2^48)  (C) (9) *(2^49)  (D) (28) *(2^53)  (E) 2^148\nA: Let's think step by step. We can simplify the expression by noticing that all three terms have a common factor of 2^26. So, we can write: (8^16) + (16^13) + (4^22) = (2^3)^16 + (2^4)^13 + (2^2)^22 = 2^(3*16) + 2^(4*13) + 2^(2*22) = 2^48 + 2^52 + 2^44 Now, we can factor out 2^44 from all three terms: (8^16) + (16^13) + (4^22) = 2^44(2^4 + 2^8 + 2^0) Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses, we get: 2^4 + 2^8 + 2^0 = 16 + 256 + 1 = 273 Therefore, the final answer is: (8^16) + (16^13) + (4^22) = 2^44 * 273 = 9 * 2^49 So, the correct answer is (C) 9 * 2^49. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
