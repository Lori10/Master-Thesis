  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Six students are equally divided into 3 groups, then, the three groups were assigned to three different topics. How many different arrangements Q are possible? Answer Choices: (A)  30 (B)  60 (C)  90 (D)  180 (E)  540\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We need to find the number of ways to divide 6 students equally into 3 groups. This can be done using combinations. We need to choose 2 students from 6 for the first group, then 2 students from the remaining 4 for the second group, and the remaining 2 students will be in the third group. The number of ways to choose 2 students from 6 is 6C2 = 15. The number of ways to choose 2 students from 4 is 4C2 = 6. So the total number of ways to divide 6 students equally into 3 groups is 15 x 6 = 90. Step 2: We need to find the number of ways to assign the 3 groups to 3 different topics. This can be done in 3! = 6 ways. Step 3: We need to find the total number of arrangements Q by multiplying the results of step 1 and step 2. Q = 90 x 6 = 540. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 540. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In how many ways can 5 boys and 3 girls be seated on 8 chairs so that no two girls are together? Answer Choices: (A) A) 5760 (B) B) 14400 (C) C) 480 (D) D) 56 (E) E) 40320\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We can seat the 5 boys in 5! ways. Step 2: We can create 4 gaps between the boys where the girls can be seated. For example, if the boys are seated as B1 B2 B3 B4 B5, the gaps are _B1_, B1_B2_, B2_B3_, B3_B4_, _B4_, where _ represents an empty chair. The girls can be seated in any 3 of these gaps in 3! ways. Step 3: We can seat the 3 girls in the chosen gaps in 3! ways. Therefore, the total number of ways to seat the boys and girls is 5! x 4 x 3! x 3! = 14,400. The answer is (B) 14,400. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: We have 4 people and 1 chairs. In how many ways chairs can be occupy? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 86 (C) 24 (D) 14 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. If we have 4 people and only 1 chair, then only one person can sit on the chair at a time. So, we need to find the number of ways in which we can choose one person out of 4 to sit on the chair. The number of ways to choose one person out of 4 is 4. Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. None of the other options are correct as they are either too high or too low for the given scenario. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: How many ways can 3 friends be arranged around a circular dinner table? Answer Choices: (A) A) 16 (B) B) 2 (C) C) 96 (D) D) 120 (E) E) 720\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We have 3 friends who need to be arranged around a circular dinner table. Step 1: Choose one friend to sit at the \"top\" of the table. This can be done in 3 ways. Step 2: Arrange the remaining 2 friends in the remaining 2 seats. This can be done in 2 ways. Step 3: Since the table is circular, we need to divide by the number of rotations. In other words, we need to divide by 3 because there are 3 ways to rotate the table and get the same arrangement. So the total number of arrangements is (3 x 2) / 3 = 2. Therefore, the answer is (B) 2. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
