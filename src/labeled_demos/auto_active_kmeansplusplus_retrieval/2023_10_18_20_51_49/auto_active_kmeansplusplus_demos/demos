            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. First, we can simplify the second ratio by cross-multiplying to get z(y + x) = (y)(y + x), which simplifies to y^2 = zx. Next, we can substitute this expression for y^2 into the first ratio to get y/(x - z) = (y + x)/z = x/zx^(1/2). Simplifying this expression, we get y = x^(3/2)/(x - z) and z = x^(1/2)/(x - z). Now, we can substitute these expressions for y and z into the ratio y^2 : x : z to get x^(3/2)/(x - z)^2 : x : x^(1/2)/(x - z). Simplifying this expression, we get x^(5/2) : x(x - z)^2 : x^(3/2)(x - z). Cancelling out an x from each term, we get x^(3/2) : (x - z)^2 : x^(1/2). Now, we can substitute the expression for z from earlier (z = x^(1/2)/(x - z)) into this ratio to get x^(3/2) : (x - x^(1/2))^2 : x^(1/2). Simplifying this expression, we get x^(3/2) : (x^2 - 2x^(3/2) + x) : x^(1/2). Finally, we can simplify the middle term by expanding the square and combining like terms to get x^(3/2) : (x^2 - 2x^(3/2) + x) : x^(1/2) = x^(3/2) : (x^2 - x^(3/2)) : x^(1/2) = x^(1/2) : (x - 1) : 1. Therefore, the answer is (E) none of these, since none of the given answer choices match the ratio x^(1/2) : (x - 1) : 1.",

In 2 hours, the pump fills the entire tank, but during this time the leak also drains some water. Let's say the leak drains 1/2 of the tank in 2 hours. So, in 2 hours, the pump fills 1/2 of the tank and the leak drains 1/2 of the tank. This means that the net amount of water added to the tank in 2 hours is 0. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 1/2 - 1/x = 0 Solving for x, we get: 1/x = 1/2 x = 2 Therefore, the leak can drain the entire tank in 2 hours. The correct answer is (A) 4 hours.

The area of the courtyard is given by multiplying its length and width: Area = 3.78 x 5.95 = 22.545 square meters Let's assume that each tile has a side length of x meters. Then the number of tiles needed to cover the courtyard can be found by dividing the area of the courtyard by the area of each tile: Number of tiles = Area of courtyard / Area of each tile Number of tiles = 22.545 / x^2 For the largest size of the tile, we want to minimize the number of tiles needed. This means we want to maximize the size of each tile. To maximize the size of each tile, we need to minimize the number of tiles. The number of tiles is minimized when each tile is as large as possible. So, we need to find the largest perfect square that is a factor of 22.545. 22.545 = 3 x 3 x 2.505 The largest perfect square that is a factor of 22.545 is 9.

The provision of food for 150 men for 60 days means that the fort has food for 150 x 60 = 9000 man-days. Step 2: Find the amount of food consumed in the first 10 days. Since there were 150 men in the fort for the first 10 days, the amount of food consumed in the first 10 days is 150 x 10 = 1500 man-days. Step 3: Find the amount of food remaining after 10 days. The amount of food remaining after 10 days is 9000 - 1500 = 7500 man-days. Step 4: Find the number of men remaining in the fort. After 25 men left the fort, the number of men remaining in the fort is 150 - 25 = 125. Step 5: Find the number of days for which the remaining food will last. Let's assume that the remaining food will last for x days. Since the same amount of food is now available for 125 men, the amount of food required for x days is 125x man-days. We know that this amount of food is equal to the remaining food in the fort, which is 7500 man-days.

The vertex of a quadratic equation in the form of h = a(t-b)^2 + c is (b, c). In this case, the vertex is (2, 150). This means that the object reaches its maximum height of 150 feet after 2 seconds. Next, we need to find the height of the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height. We can do this by plugging in t = 4 (2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height) into the equation h = -15(t-2)^2 + 150. h = -15(4-2)^2 + 150 h = -15(2)^2 + 150 h = -60 + 150 h = 90 Therefore, the height of the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height is 90 feet.

If the merchant sells the sweater at a 60% discount, he sells it for 40% of the original price, which is $40. Now, we know that the merchant makes a 20% profit on the wholesale cost at which he initially purchased the item. So, the cost price for the merchant is $100, and he makes a profit of 20%, which is $20. Therefore, the selling price for the merchant is $120. We can now calculate the markup percentage from the wholesale price to the normal retail price. Markup percentage = (Selling price - Wholesale price) / Wholesale price x 100% Markup percentage = ($120 - $100) / $100 x 100% Markup percentage = 20% Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 20%.",

Let's try 97. 97 is a prime number, so its only prime factor is itself. The product of this prime is 97, which is less than the square root of 97 (which is approximately 9.85). Therefore, 97 is prime saturated. Let's try 96. The prime factors of 96 are 2, 3, and 5. The product of these primes is 30, which is less than the square root of 96 (which is approximately 9.8). Therefore, 96 is prime saturated. Let's try 95. The prime factors of 95 are 5 and 19. The product of these primes is 95, which is equal to the square root of 95. Therefore, 95 is not prime saturated. Therefore, the greatest prime saturated two-digit integer is 98, which is option (B).",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that there are 100 passengers on the ship. 40% of the passengers held round-trip tickets and took their cars abroad the ship, which means there are 40 passengers who fit this description. Now, we know that 50% of the passengers with round-trip tickets did not take their cars abroad the ship. So, out of the 40 passengers with round-trip tickets, 50% did not take their cars, which means 20 passengers did not take their cars. Therefore, the remaining 20 passengers with round-trip tickets did take their cars abroad the ship. To find the percentage of passengers with round-trip tickets, we divide the total number of passengers (100) into the number of passengers with round-trip tickets (40). 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%. So, the answer is (A) 40%.",

So, the probability of getting 4 consecutive tails in 5 throws can be calculated as follows: Probability = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/32 However, we need to take into account that A has already gotten a tail in the first throw.

The cost of fencing the plot is Rs. 26.50 per metre. Therefore, the total cost of fencing the rectangular plot is: Perimeter of the plot x Cost per metre = (2 x length + 2 x breadth) x 26.50 Substituting the values of length and breadth, we get: (2(x+20) + 2x) x 26.50 = 7420 Simplifying the equation, we get: 6.5x + 530 = 371 6.5x = 371 - 530 6.5x = -159 x = -24.46 Since the breadth cannot be negative, this answer is not possible.

After the decrease of 5%, the new number of seats will be 95 (100 - 5% of 100) and the new price of a ticket will be $9.50 (10 - 5% of 10). Therefore, the new revenue collected can be calculated as follows: New revenue = New number of seats x New price of a ticket New revenue = 95 x 9.50 New revenue = $902.50 Now, let's compare the new revenue with the original revenue: Original revenue = Original number of seats x Original price of a ticket Original revenue = 100 x 10 Original revenue = $1000 The percentage decrease in revenue can be calculated as follows: Percentage decrease = (Original revenue - New revenue) / Original revenue x 100% Percentage decrease = (1000 - 902.50) / 1000 x 100% Percentage decrease = 9.75% Therefore, the answer is (C) -9.75%.",

We can use this information to try and find a relationship between the letters in \"COMPUTER\" and the letters in \"VIRUS\" and \"WORM\". One possible relationship is that the code for each letter in \"VIRUS\" and \"WORM\" is equal to the code for the corresponding letter in \"COMPUTER\" plus a certain constant. Let's call this constant \"k\". Using this relationship, we can set up two equations: V + k + I + k + R + k + U + k + S + k = ? W + k + O + k + R + k + M + k = ? We don't know the values of \"k\" or the sum of the codes, but we can simplify the equations by combining like terms: (5k + V + I + R + U + S) = ? (4k + W + O + R + M) = ? We still don't have enough information to solve for the sum of the codes, but we can use the fact that the sum of the codes is a multiple of 3 (since 111 is a multiple of 3). Looking at the simplified equations, we can see that the sum of the letters in \"VIRUS\" is 5 + V + I + R + U + S, which is odd (since 5 is odd).

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the retailer originally ordered x number of white and yellow tennis balls each. According to the problem, the dispatch clerk dispatched 50 extra yellow balls. So, the total number of yellow balls became (x + 50) and the number of white balls remained x. Now, the ratio of white balls to yellow balls is given as 7/11. So, we can write the equation: x/(x+50) = 7/11 Cross-multiplying, we get: 11x = 7(x+50) 11x = 7x + 350 4x = 350 x = 87.5 Therefore, the retailer originally ordered 87.5 white and 87.5 yellow tennis balls each. But since we need to find the total number of tennis balls, we add them up: 87.5 + 87.5 + 50 (extra yellow balls) = 225 So, the correct answer is (None of the above) 225.",

If he exceeds his days by 4 days, he would have to cut down his daily expenses by Rs 3. This means his new daily expenses would be (360/(x+4)) - 3. We can set up an equation: 360/x = (360/(x+4)) - 3 Multiplying both sides by x(x+4), we get: 360(x+4) = 360x - 3x(x+4) Simplifying, we get: 1440 = -3x^2 + 48x + 1440 Rearranging, we get: 3x^2 - 48x = 0 Dividing both sides by 3x, we get: x - 16 = 0 Therefore, x = 16.

Next, we need to find the number of pairs of dogs that are littermates. For the 6 dogs with exactly 1 littermate, each dog has only one possible littermate, so there are 6 pairs of littermates. For the 3 dogs with exactly 2 littermates, each dog has 2 possible littermates, so there are 3 * 2 = 6 pairs of littermates. So there are a total of 6 + 6 = 12 pairs of littermates. Finally, we can use the formula for probability: Q = (number of pairs that are not littermates) / (total number of pairs) Q = (36 - 12) / 36 = 24 / 36 = 2/3 Therefore, the answer is (B) 2/9.",

Next, we need to find out how far the thief has traveled in 1.5 hours at 60 km/hr. Distance = Speed x Time, so distance = 60 km/hr x 1.5 hr = 90 km. Now, we can set up an equation to find out when the owner will overtake the thief. Let t be the time it takes for the owner to catch up to the thief. The distance the owner travels is the same as the distance the thief travels plus the 90 km the thief traveled before the owner set off. So: 75t = 90 + 60t Simplifying this equation, we get: 15t = 90 t = 6 So it will take the owner 6 hours to catch up to the thief.

Since the perimeter is 36cm and there are six sides, each side has a length of 6cm. Next, we need to find the area of triangle ABE. We can use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is 1/2 * base * height. The base is AB, which has a length of 6cm. To find the height, we need to draw a perpendicular line from E to AB. Let's call the point where the perpendicular line intersects AB point G. Triangle AEG is a 30-60-90 triangle, so the height EG is 3√3 cm. Therefore, the area of triangle ABE is 1/2 * 6cm * 3√3 cm = 9√3 cm2. We can use the same method to find the area of triangle BDE. The base is BD, which also has a length of 6cm. To find the height, we need to draw a perpendicular line from D to BD. Let's call the point where the perpendicular line intersects BD point H. Triangle BDH is also a 30-60-90 triangle, so the height DH is 3√3 cm. Therefore, the area of triangle BDE is 1/2 * 6cm * 3√3 cm = 9√3 cm2.

So his remuneration under the new scheme would be: 0.025(x-4000) + 900 And we know that this is Rs. 600 more than his remuneration under the previous scheme, which was 0.05x. So we can set up an equation: 0.025(x-4000) + 900 = 0.05x + 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.025x - 100 + 900 = 0.05x + 600 0.025x + 800 = 0.05x + 600 0.025x = 200 x = 8000 Therefore, his sales were worth Rs. 8,000.

The first puncture can make the tyre flat in 9 minutes, which means it can make the tyre lose 4 units of air per minute (36/9). Similarly, the second puncture can make the tyre flat in 4 minutes, which means it can make the tyre lose 9 units of air per minute (36/4). Now, let's assume that both punctures are working together. Let's say the time taken for both punctures to make the tyre flat is 't' minutes. So, in 't' minutes, the first puncture would have made the tyre lose 4t units of air and the second puncture would have made the tyre lose 9t units of air. Since both punctures are working together, the total air lost in 't' minutes would be 4t + 9t = 13t. We know that the tyre has a capacity of 36 units of air.

Then, we know that the average age is increased by 2 years, so the new average age is \"x+2\". Next, we replace two men with two women. Let's call the ages of the two women \"a\" and \"b\". We know that the total age of the 8 men is 8x, and the total age of the 2 men we are replacing is 20+24=44. So, the total age of the 6 remaining men is 8x-44. When we add the ages of the two women, the total age becomes (8x-44)+a+b. We want to find the new average age, so we need to divide this total age by the new number of people, which is 8 (since we still have 8 people, just with 2 women instead of 2 men). So, the new average age is [(8x-44)+a+b]/8. We want to simplify this expression and solve for the average age of the two women, so let's start by distributing the division: [(8x-44)+a+b]/8 = (8x-44)/8 + (a+b)/8 We know that the first term on the right side is the new average age of the 6 remaining men, which is x+2. So, we can substitute that in: (x+2) + (a+b)/8 = x+2 Now we can solve for (a+b)/8: (a+b)/8 = 0 This means that the sum of the ages of the two women is 0, which is impossible.

The sum of all even integers from 2 to 400 can be found using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = (n/2)(a + l) where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term. In this case, a = 2, l = 400, and n = (400 - 2)/2 + 1 = 200. So, we have: S1 = (200/2)(2 + 400) = 40200 Next, we need to find the sum of all even integers from 2 to 300.

According to the problem, the height of the first high-rise is 37 feet taller than the second high-rise. Therefore, the height of the first high-rise is (z+37) feet. The sum of the heights of both high-rises is x feet. Therefore, we can write an equation as: z + (z+37) = x Simplifying the equation: 2z + 37 = x Subtracting 37 from both sides: 2z = x - 37 Dividing both sides by 2: z = (x-37)/2 Therefore, the height of the second high-rise will be (x-37)/2 feet. Hence, the correct answer is (A) (x-37).",

We also know that the distance between A and B is 600 km. So, we can set up the equation: 50x + 40x = 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 90x = 600 x = 6.67 hours Now that we know they meet after 6.67 hours, we can find out how far each of them has traveled: A: 50 km/h x 6.67 h = 333.33 km B: 40 km/h x 6.67 h = 266.67 km The total distance they have traveled is: 333.33 km + 266.67 km = 600 km Therefore, the answer is (B) 600 km.",

So, we can set up the equation: 10% of the investment = Rs. 650 0.1 x investment = 650 investment = 650 / 0.1 investment = Rs. 6,500 Now, we need to find out how many shares can be bought with an investment of Rs. 6,500 at Rs. 96 per share. Number of shares = investment / share price Number of shares = 6,500 / 96 Number of shares = 67.71 (approx.) Since we cannot buy a fraction of a share, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

When the store clerk reaches in to draw two individual gloves simultaneously and at random, there are a total of 20 gloves in the bag. To calculate the probability of drawing two gloves of the same color, we need to first calculate the total number of possible outcomes. The total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to choose 2 gloves out of 20, which is: 20 choose 2 = (20 * 19) / (2 * 1) = 190 Next, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to choose 2 gloves of the same color. There are 10 different colors to choose from, so the number of ways to choose 2 gloves of the same color is: 10 choose 1 = 10 For each color, there are 2 gloves to choose from, so the total number of ways to choose 2 gloves of the same color is: 10 * (2 choose 2) = 10 Therefore, the probability of drawing two gloves of the same color is: 10 / 190 = 1/19 So the correct answer is (E) 1/19.",

We know that the first train takes 10 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/10 = 12 m/s. Similarly, the second train takes 15 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/15 = 8 m/s.

But the shopkeeper uses a faulty meter that weighs 800 grams instead of 1 kilogram (1000 grams). So, the customer gets only 800 grams of goods for the price of 1 kilogram. To find the selling price of 1 kilogram of goods, we can use the formula: Selling price = Cost price / (Weight of goods / Weight sold) Selling price = 100 / (1000 / 800) = $80 So, the shopkeeper is selling 1 kilogram of goods at $80, which is the cost price of 800 grams of goods. Now, let's calculate the profit percent: Profit = Selling price - Cost price = $80 - $100 = -$20 The profit is negative because the shopkeeper is selling the goods at cost price.

Solving for J, we get: J = 18/(k-8) Since J is a positive integer, k-8 must be a factor of 18. The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. We can try each of these values for k and see which ones give us a positive integer value for J. For k=9, we get J = 18/(9-8) = 18, which is a positive integer. This is our answer. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 22.",

Now, we can calculate the profit or loss percentage using the formula: Profit or loss percentage = (Profit or loss / Cost price) x 100 Profit or loss = Selling price - Cost price Cost price of 11 bags = Rs.1000 Selling price of 11 bags = Rs.1650 Profit or loss = Rs.1650 - Rs.1000 = Rs.650 Profit or loss percentage = (650/1000) x 100 = 65% Therefore, the answer is None of the above, as none of the given options match the calculated profit or loss percentage of 65%.",

Similarly, we can find the values of A(3), A(4), and so on, by repeatedly applying the given equation. For example, A(3) = 2A(2) - 1 = 2(5) - 1 = 9, and A(4) = 2A(3) - 1 = 2(9) - 1 = 17. We can observe that the sequence A(n) can be written as A(n) = 2^n + 1 for all positive integers n. We can prove this by mathematical induction. Base case: A(1) = 2^1 + 1 = 3, which is true. Inductive step: Assume that A(k) = 2^k + 1 for some positive integer k. Then, A(k+1) = 2A(k) - 1 = 2(2^k + 1) - 1 = 2^(k+1) + 1, which is also true.

If she withdraws a number of these coins at random, how many coins would she have to withdraw to ensure that she has at least a 50 percent chance of withdrawing at least one quarter? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) 5",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We know that the girl has 6 quarters, 6 dimes, and 10 nickels in her pocket. To find the probability of withdrawing at least one quarter, we need to find the total number of possible outcomes and the number of outcomes that include at least one quarter. The total number of possible outcomes is the sum of the number of ways she can withdraw 1 coin, 2 coins, 3 coins, and so on, up to 22 coins (the total number of coins she has). The number of outcomes that include at least one quarter is the sum of the number of ways she can withdraw 1 quarter and any combination of the remaining coins, 2 quarters and any combination of the remaining coins, and so on, up to all 6 quarters. We want to find the minimum number of coins she needs to withdraw to have at least a 50% chance of getting at least one quarter. Let's look at the answer choices: (A) 1 - If she withdraws only one coin, there is no guarantee that it will be a quarter. (B) 2 - If she withdraws two coins, there are three possible outcomes: quarter-dime, quarter-nickel, and dime-nickel. Only one of these outcomes includes a quarter, so the probability of getting at least one quarter is less than 50%. (C) 3 - If she withdraws three coins, there are ten possible outcomes: quarter-dime-nickel, quarter-nickel-nickel, dime-quarter-nickel, dime-dime-nickel, dime-nickel-nickel, quarter-quarter-dime, quarter-quarter-nickel, quarter-dime-dime, quarter-nickel-dime, and quarter-nickel-nickel. Six of these outcomes include at least one quarter, so the probability of getting at least one quarter is greater than 50%. (D) 4 - If she withdraws four coins, there are 35 possible outcomes. We can calculate the number of outcomes that include at least one quarter by subtracting the number of outcomes that include no quarters from the total number of outcomes. The number of outcomes that include no quarters is the number of ways she can withdraw 4 dimes and 1 nickel, 3 dimes and 2 nickels, 2 dimes and 3 nickels, or 1 dime and 4 nickels, which is 4+10+10+4=28. Therefore, the number of outcomes that include at least one quarter is 35-28=7. The probability of getting at least one quarter is 7/35, which is less than 50%. (E) 5 - If she withdraws five coins, there are 56 possible outcomes. We can calculate the number of outcomes that include at least one quarter by subtracting the number of outcomes that include no quarters or only one quarter from the total number of outcomes. The number of outcomes that include no quarters is the number of ways she can withdraw 5 dimes and no nickels, which is 1. The number of outcomes that include only one quarter is the number of ways she can withdraw 1 quarter and any combination of the remaining coins, which is 5+10+10=25. Therefore, the number of outcomes that include at least two quarters is 56-1-25=30. The probability of getting at least one quarter is 30/56, which is greater than 50%. Therefore, the answer is (C) 3.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. Let's assume that the cube has a side length of \"x\". Therefore, its surface area would be 6x^2 (since there are 6 faces, each with an area of x^2). Now, let's consider the rectangular solid that is identical to the cube in all ways except that its length has been doubled. This means that its dimensions are 2x, x, and x (since the width and height are the same as the cube). Therefore, its surface area would be: 2(2x)(x) + 2(2x)(x) + 2(x)(x) = 4x^2 + 4x^2 + 2x^2 = 10x^2 Now, we can find the ratio G of the surface area of the cube to the surface area of the rectangular solid by dividing the surface area of the cube by the surface area of the rectangular solid: G = (surface area of cube) / (surface area of rectangular solid) G = (6x^2) / (10x^2) G = 3/5 Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 3/5.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time taken by the minute hand to cross the hour hand once. The minute hand moves 12 times as fast as the hour hand (since it covers 12 hours in one rotation while the hour hand covers only 1 hour). So, the relative speed between the two hands is 11 times the speed of the hour hand. Therefore, the time taken by the minute hand to cross the hour hand once is 12/11 hours or 65 5/11 minutes. Now, we are given that the minute hand crosses the hour hand for the third time exactly after every 3 hrs., 18 min., 15 seconds of watch time. So, in one day (24 hours), the minute hand will cross the hour hand for the third time 8 times (since 24 divided by 3 is 8). Therefore, the total time taken by the minute hand to cross the hour hand 8 times is 8 times 65 5/11 minutes, which is equal to 522 2/11 minutes. Now, we need to convert this time into hours and minutes. 522 2/11 minutes is equal to 8 hours, 42 minutes, and 2 2/11 seconds. So, the watch gains 42 minutes and 2 2/11 seconds in one day.

Out of these options, the greatest possible value of B x A is 25, which occurs when B is 5 and A is 5. Therefore, the answer is (D) 25.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the radius of the circular garden. We know that the diameter is 4 meters, so the radius is half of that, which is 2 meters. Next, we need to find the radius of the garden plus the width of the path. The width of the path is given as 25 cm, which is 0.25 meters. So, the radius of the garden plus the width of the path is 2 + 0.25 = 2.25 meters. Now, we can find the area of the path by subtracting the area of the garden from the area of the larger circle with radius 2.25 meters. The area of the garden is πr^2 = π(2)^2 = 4π square meters. The area of the larger circle is π(2.25)^2 = 5.06π square meters. So, the area of the path is 5.06π - 4π = 1.06π square meters. Finally, we can approximate this value using 3.14 as an approximation for π. So, the area of the path is approximately 1.06 x 3.14 = 3.3244 square meters, which is closest to answer choice (A) 3.34 sq m. Therefore, the answer is (A) 3.34 sq m.",

The largest multiple of 12 less than 200 is 12 x 16 = 192. Now, we need to find the number of integers that are multiples of both 12 and 13. To do this, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 13, which is 156. The largest multiple of 156 less than 200 is 156 x 1 = 156. So, we need to count the number of multiples of 13 from 13 to 195 (inclusive), the number of multiples of 12 from 12 to 192 (inclusive), and subtract the number of multiples of 156 from the total. The number of multiples of 13 from 13 to 195 is (195-13)/13 + 1 = 15. The number of multiples of 12 from 12 to 192 is (192-12)/12 + 1 = 16. The number of multiples of 156 from 156 to 156 is 1. Therefore, the total number of positive integers less than 200 that are either multiples of 13 or multiples of 12 is 15 + 16 - 1 = 30. So, the answer is (C) 30.",

This can be calculated using the combination formula: 10C7 = 10! / (7! * 3!) = 120 So there are 120 possible combinations of 7 questions. Step 2: We also know that at least 3 of the first 5 questions must be answered. This means that the student can either answer 3, 4, or 5 questions from the first 5. Step 3: We need to find the number of ways to choose the remaining questions from the remaining 5.

The sum of the coefficients is: 1 - (v+1) + v = 2v - 1 So, we need to find which values of v make 2v-1 divisible by 3. If v = -4, then 2v-1 = -9, which is divisible by 3.

So, the customer spends 70% of $125, which is $87.50. The net difference in expenditure can be calculated by finding the percentage decrease in expenditure. The original expenditure would have been 100% of $125, which is $125. The actual expenditure is $87.50.

The trader bought the car at a 20% discount, which means he paid 80% of the original price, i.e., $80. He then sold the car at a 40% increase on the price he bought it, which means he sold it for 140% of the price he bought it, i.e., $112. Now, let's calculate the profit he made on the original price. Profit = Selling price - Cost price Profit = $112 - $100 Profit = $12 Therefore, the profit he made on the original price was $12. To calculate the percentage profit, we need to divide the profit by the original price and multiply by 100. Percentage profit = (Profit / Original price) x 100 Percentage profit = ($12 / $100) x 100 Percentage profit = 12% Therefore, the trader made a profit of 12% on the original price.

This is simply 3/5 since there are 3 yellow balls out of a total of 5 balls. Next, we need to find the probability of selecting a yellow ball on the second draw given that the first ball was yellow. Since we already know that the first ball was yellow, there are now only 4 balls left in the bag, with 2 of them being yellow. Therefore, the probability of selecting a yellow ball on the second draw is 2/4 or 1/2. Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the first ball was yellow given that the second ball was yellow. Let Y1 and Y2 denote the events that the first and second balls are yellow, respectively. Then, we want to find P(Y1|Y2), which is given by: P(Y1|Y2) = P(Y2|Y1) * P(Y1) / P(Y2) We already know that P(Y1) = 3/5 and P(Y2|Y1) = 1/2. To find P(Y2), we can use the law of total probability: P(Y2) = P(Y2|Y1) * P(Y1) + P(Y2|not Y1) * P(not Y1) Since there are only 2 possibilities for the first ball (yellow or not yellow), we have: P(not Y1) = 1 - P(Y1) = 2/5 P(Y2|not Y1) = 2/3 (since there are 2 yellow balls left out of a total of 3 balls) Plugging in the values, we get: P(Y1|Y2) = (1/2) * (3/5) / [(1/2) * (3/5) + (2/3) * (2/5)] = 3/4 Therefore, the answer is (C) 3/4.",

Total provisions = 2400 women x 100 days = 240,000 woman-days Now, if there were 1200 men less, the total number of people in the camp would be 2400 women - 1200 men = 1200 women. So, the provisions need to last for 1200 women for some number of days. Let's call the number of days the provisions will last for 1200 women \"x\". We know that the total amount of provisions is the same, so: 240,000 woman-days = 1200 women x days Solving for \"x\": x = 240,000 woman-days / 1200 women x = 200 days Therefore, the provisions will last for 200 days for 1200 women (or 2400 women and 1200 men).

Next, we need to find the number of positive integers less than 5000 that are divisible by 17. We can do this by dividing 4999 by 17 (using integer division) to get 294. So there are 294 multiples of 17 less than 5000. Similarly, we can find the number of positive integers less than 5000 that are divisible by 21. Dividing 4999 by 21 (using integer division) gives us 238. So there are 238 multiples of 21 less than 5000. However, we have counted some numbers twice - those that are multiples of both 17 and 21. To find the number of these, we need to find the multiples of the least common multiple of 17 and 21, which is 357. Dividing 4999 by 357 (using integer division) gives us 14. So there are 14 multiples of 357 less than 5000. To find the number of positive integers less than 5000 that are divisible by neither 17 nor 21, we need to subtract the total number of multiples of 17 and 21 (counted twice) from the total number of positive integers less than 5000.

The first train starts at 7 a.m. and the second train starts at 8 a.m., which means the first train has a one-hour head start. In one hour, the first train covers a distance of 20 km. Now, let's assume that the two trains meet after t hours. In that case, the second train would have traveled for t - 1 hours. Let's use the formula: distance = speed x time Distance covered by the first train + Distance covered by the second train = Total distance between the two stations 20t + 25(t-1) = 110 Simplifying the equation, we get: 45t = 135 t = 3 Therefore, the two trains will meet after 3 hours.

So, time taken downstream = distance/speed = 81/(w+c) Similarly, when she swims upstream, her effective speed is (w - c) and the distance covered is 36 km. So, time taken upstream = distance/speed = 36/(w-c) According to the problem, both these times are equal and add up to 9 hours.

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total cost of the mixture. Total cost of 27 kg butter at Rs. 150 per kg = 27 x 150 = Rs. 4050 Total cost of 36 kg butter at Rs. 125 per kg = 36 x 125 = Rs. 4500 Total cost of the mixture = Rs. 4050 + Rs. 4500 = Rs. 8550 Step 2: Find the total weight of the mixture. Total weight of the mixture = 27 kg + 36 kg = 63 kg Step 3: Find the cost per kg of the mixture. Cost per kg of the mixture = Total cost of the mixture / Total weight of the mixture Cost per kg of the mixture = Rs. 8550 / 63 kg = Rs. 135.71 per kg Step 4: Find the selling price per kg to make a profit of 40%. Profit percentage = 40% Profit = Cost price x Profit percentage Profit = Rs. 135.71 x 40/100 = Rs. 54.28 per kg Selling price per kg = Cost price per kg + Profit per kg Selling price per kg = Rs. 135.71 + Rs. 54.28 = Rs. 189.99 per kg Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 190.",

After 4 months, A withdraws half of his capital, which means he withdraws Rs.4000. So, A's investment for the remaining 8 months is Rs.4000. B does not withdraw any amount after 4 months. After 6 months (2 months after A's withdrawal), B withdraws one-third of his capital, which means he withdraws Rs.3000. So, B's investment for the remaining 6 months is Rs.6000. Now, let's calculate the ratio of their investments for the entire year. A's investment for the year = (4/12)*8000 + (8/12)*4000 = 2667 + 2667 = 5334 B's investment for the year = (6/12)*9000 + (6/12)*6000 = 4500 + 3000 = 7500 Therefore, the ratio of their investments for the entire year is 5334:7500, which simplifies to 32:45.

(A) Q+1: If Q is odd, then Q+1 is even. If Q is even, then Q+1 is odd. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Q+1 is odd or even. (B) Q^2+Q: We can factor out Q from this expression to get Q(Q+1). Since Q is a positive integer, Q+1 is also a positive integer. Therefore, Q(Q+1) is the product of two consecutive integers, one of which must be even. Therefore, Q(Q+1) is always even. (C) Q^2+Q+1: We can rewrite this expression as (Q+1)^2 - Q. Since (Q+1)^2 is always odd (the square of an odd number is odd), and subtracting an odd number from an odd number results in an even number, Q^2+Q+1 is always odd.

If there was no leak, the cistern would be filled in 4 hours. So, the rate of filling would be 1/4 units per hour. But because of the leak, it takes 2 hours longer to fill the cistern. So, the new time taken to fill the cistern is 4 + 2 = 6 hours. Let's assume that the leak can empty the cistern in x hours. Now, we can set up an equation based on the principle that the amount of water filled in the cistern is equal to the amount of water emptied by the leak when the cistern is full. Amount of water filled = Amount of water emptied Rate of filling x Time taken to fill = Rate of emptying x Time taken to empty 1 = (1/4) x 6 + (1/x) x t where t is the time taken to empty the cistern when it is full. Simplifying the equation, we get: 1 = (3/2) + (t/x) (t/x) = 1/2 t = (x/2) So, the time taken to empty the cistern when it is full is half the time taken by the leak to empty it.

For the remaining two bags, the probability of drawing a black ball is 4/5 (since there are 4 black balls out of a total of 5 balls in each bag). Now, we need to find the probability that the black ball came from the second group (the two bags with 1 white and 4 black balls). Let's call this event A.

Let's call the event of drawing a black ball B. The probability of B happening is the probability of drawing a black ball from any of the five bags, which is (3 * 2/7) + (2 * 4/5) = 62/175. Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability of A given B: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) P(B|A) is the probability of drawing a black ball given that it came from the second group, which is 4/5.

This means that the customer is paying for 100g less than what they think they are paying for. To calculate the profit percentage, we need to find the profit made by the shopkeeper. Profit = Selling price - Cost price Cost price = $100 (as assumed earlier) Selling price = $108 Profit = $108 - $100 = $8 Now, we need to calculate the profit percentage.

A works for 5 days, so he completes 5/30th of the work, which simplifies to 1/6th of the work. The remaining work is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6th of the work. Now, B finishes the remaining work in 20 days. So, in 1 day, he can do 1/20th of the work. Let's assume that A and B together can do the work in x days. So, in 1 day, A and B together can do 1/xth of the work. We know that A completes 1/6th of the work in 5 days. So, in 1 day, he can do 1/30th of the work. Therefore, the work done by B in 20 days + the work done by A in 5 days = the work done by A and B together in x days.

Therefore, the total distance covered by the train is (x + 180) meters in 18 seconds. We know that the speed of the train is constant in both cases.

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. There are 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice, as each die has 6 possible outcomes. To find the probability of rolling an even total, we need to count the number of outcomes where the sum is even. One way to approach this is to consider the possible outcomes for each die separately. For the first die, there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) and 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5). For the second die, the same is true. So we can use a table to count the number of outcomes where the sum is even: | | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | |---|---|---|---|---|---|---| | 1 | | | | | | | | 2 | | X | | X | | X | | 3 | | | | | | | | 4 | | X | | X | | X | | 5 | | | | | | | | 6 | | X | | X | | X | Each X represents an outcome where the sum is even. Counting the X's, we see that there are 18 even outcomes out of 36 total outcomes. So the probability of rolling an even total is 18/36, which simplifies to 1/2.

After 3 minutes, the cistern would have been filled with 3/6th or 1/2 of its capacity. Now, only pipe A is filling the remaining 1/2 of the cistern. In one minute, pipe A can fill 1/10th of the cistern. Therefore, the time taken to fill the remaining 1/2 of the cistern by pipe A alone would be 1/2 ÷ 1/10 = 5 minutes.

Then, the speed of the train will be (16/15)x km/h (as given in the ratio). Next, we are given that the speed of the bus is 3/4th of the speed of the train. So, the speed of the bus will be (3/4)(16/15)x = (4/5)x km/h. We know that the bus covered a distance of 480 km in 8 hours. So, its speed is 480/8 = 60 km/h. Equating the speed of the bus to (4/5)x, we get: (4/5)x = 60 x = (5/4) * 60 x = 75 So, the speed of the car is 75 km/h. Now, we need to find how much distance the car will cover in 6 hours.

We multiply 0.375 by 2, which gives us 0.75. We take the integer part, which is 0, and write it down. We then multiply the remaining fractional part (0.75) by 2 again, which gives us 1.5. We take the integer part, which is 1, and write it down. We continue this process until we get a repeating pattern or until we reach the desired level of precision. 0.375 x 2 = 0.75 (integer part = 0) 0.75 x 2 = 1.5 (integer part = 1) 0.5 x 2 = 1 (integer part = 1) So the binary equivalent of 0.375 is 0.011.
