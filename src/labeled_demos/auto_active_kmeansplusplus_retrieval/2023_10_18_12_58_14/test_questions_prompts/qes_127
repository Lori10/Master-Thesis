  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Jamboree and GMAT Club Contest Starts\nQUESTION #20:\nHow many words (with or without meaning) can be formed using all the letters of the word \u201cSELFIE\u201d so that the two E\u2019s are not together? Answer Choices: (A)  660 (B)  600 (C)  500 (D)  300 (E)  240\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of ways to arrange all the letters of the word \"SELFIE\". This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken all at a time, which is n!. In this case, n = 6, so the total number of arrangements is 6! = 720. Next, we need to subtract the number of arrangements where the two E's are together. To do this, we can treat the two E's as a single object and find the number of arrangements of the five objects \"S\", \"L\", \"F\", \"I\", and \"EE\". This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is nPr = n!/(n-r)!. In this case, n = 5 and r = 5, so the number of arrangements where the two E's are together is 5! = 120. Finally, we can subtract the number of arrangements where the two E's are together from the total number of arrangements to get the number of arrangements where the two E's are not together: 720 - 120 = 600. Therefore, the answer is (B) 600. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In how many different orders can the people Alice, Benjamin, Charlene, David, Elaine, Frederick, Gale, and Harold be standing on line if each of Alice, Benjamin, Charlene must be on the line before each of Frederick, Gale, and Harold? Answer Choices: (A) 1,008 (B) 1,296 (C) 1,512 (D) 2,016 (E) 2,268\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to arrange Alice, Benjamin, and Charlene in a line. This can be done in 3! = 6 ways. Next, we need to arrange Frederick, Gale, and Harold in a line. This can also be done in 3! = 6 ways. Now, we have 5 people left to arrange: David, Elaine, and the 3 groups of 3 people (ABC, FGH). We can think of these 5 people as 5 slots that need to be filled. The first slot can be filled by any of the 8 people. The second slot can be filled by any of the remaining 7 people. The third slot can be filled by any of the remaining 6 people. The fourth slot can be filled by any of the remaining 5 people. The fifth slot can be filled by any of the remaining 4 people. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange all 8 people is: 6 x 6 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 = 1,296 So the answer is (B) 1,296. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If there are 9 pairs of twins, and a committee will be formed with 3 members. In how many ways this committee formed in a way that no siblings in a group? Answer Choices: (A) 632 (B) 672 (C) 756 (D) 744 (E) 740\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We have 18 individuals (9 pairs of twins). Step 2: We need to choose 3 individuals for the committee. Step 3: We cannot choose any siblings in the same group. Step 4: To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Step 5: First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 individuals from 18, which is 18C3 = 816. Step 6: Next, we calculate the number of ways to choose 3 individuals with at least one pair of siblings in the same group. Step 7: There are 9 ways to choose one pair of siblings and one additional individual from the remaining 16 individuals (9*16 = 144). Step 8: There are 36 ways to choose two pairs of siblings (9C2) and one additional individual from the remaining 15 individuals (15 = 15). Step 9: However, we have counted the case where all three individuals are siblings twice, so we need to subtract this case once. Step 10: There are 9 ways to choose three siblings from the 9 pairs of twins (9C3). Step 11: Therefore, the number of ways to choose 3 individuals with at least one pair of siblings in the same group is 144 + 36 - 9 = 171. Step 12: Finally, we subtract this number from the total number of ways to choose 3 individuals to get the number of ways to choose 3 individuals with no siblings in the same group: 816 - 171 = 645. Step 13: None of the answer choices match our answer, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Carmelo and LeBron participate in a seven-person footrace on the basketball court during All-Star Weekend. If all seven contestants finish (including Charles Barkley) and there are no ties, how many different arrangements of finishes are there in which Carmelo defeats LeBron? Answer Choices: (A)  5040 (B)  2520 (C)  720 (D)  120 (E)  42\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to choose the positions for Carmelo and LeBron. There are 2 options for the first place, and once that is decided, there is only 1 option for the second place. Next, we need to arrange the remaining 5 people in the remaining 5 positions. There are 5 options for the third place, 4 options for the fourth place, 3 options for the fifth place, 2 options for the sixth place, and 1 option for the seventh place. Therefore, the total number of arrangements in which Carmelo defeats LeBron is 2 x 1 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 240. None of the answer choices match our result, so the answer is None of the above. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
