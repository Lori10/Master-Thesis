  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Rajesh solved 80 per cent of the questions in an examination correctly. If out of 41 questions solved by Rajesh 37 questions are correct and of the remaining questions out of 8 questions 5 questions have been solved by Rajesh correctly then find the total number of questions asked in the examination. Answer Choices: (A) 75 (B) 65 (C) 60 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Rajesh solved 80% of the questions correctly. This means that he got 37 questions correct out of a total of x questions. We can write this as: 0.8x = 37 Solving for x, we get: x = 46.25 However, we know that the number of questions asked in the examination must be a whole number. Therefore, we can assume that the actual number of questions asked is either 46 or 47. Next, we know that Rajesh solved a total of 41 questions. Of these, 37 were correct and 4 were incorrect. This means that he attempted 8 - 4 = 4 questions in the remaining set of questions. We also know that he got 5 out of these 8 questions correct. Therefore, the total number of questions asked in the examination is: 37 + 4 + 5 = 46 So the answer is (A) 75. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: At a contest with 2,500 participants, 1/2 of the people are aged 10 to 12. Next year, the number of people aged 10 to 12 will increase by 1/5. After this change, what percentage of the total 2,500 people will the 10- to 12-year-olds represent? Answer Choices: (A) 55% (B) 60% (C) 50% (D) 45% (E) 66%\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 at the contest. 1/2 of 2,500 = 1,250 people aged 10 to 12. Step 2: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1/5 of 1,250 = 250 people increase. 1,250 + 250 = 1,500 people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. Step 3: Find the percentage of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1,500/2,500 x 100% = 60% Therefore, the answer is (B) 60%. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In how many different orders can the people Alice, Benjamin, Charlene, David, Elaine, Frederick, Gale, and Harold be standing on line if each of Alice, Benjamin, Charlene must be on the line before each of Frederick, Gale, and Harold? Answer Choices: (A) 1,008 (B) 1,296 (C) 1,512 (D) 2,016 (E) 2,268\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to arrange Alice, Benjamin, and Charlene in a line. This can be done in 3! = 6 ways. Next, we need to arrange Frederick, Gale, and Harold in a line. This can also be done in 3! = 6 ways. Now, we have 5 people left to arrange: David, Elaine, and the 3 groups of 3 people (ABC, FGH). We can think of these 5 people as 5 slots that need to be filled. The first slot can be filled by any of the 8 people. The second slot can be filled by any of the remaining 7 people. The third slot can be filled by any of the remaining 6 people. The fourth slot can be filled by any of the remaining 5 people. The fifth slot can be filled by any of the remaining 4 people. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange all 8 people is: 6 x 6 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 = 1,296 So the answer is (B) 1,296. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: 69 laboratories raise the bacterium, the laboratory have 48 culture dishes on average, which has about 25,075 bacteria each. How many bacteria are there approximately? Answer Choices: (A) 10^7 (B) 10^8 (C) 10^9 (D) 10^10 (E) 10^11\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of culture dishes in all the laboratories. Total number of culture dishes = 69 x 48 = 3312 Step 2: Find the total number of bacteria in all the culture dishes. Total number of bacteria = 3312 x 25,075 = 83,076,000 Step 3: Convert the total number of bacteria into scientific notation. 83,076,000 = 8.3076 x 10^7 Therefore, the answer is (A) 10^7. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
