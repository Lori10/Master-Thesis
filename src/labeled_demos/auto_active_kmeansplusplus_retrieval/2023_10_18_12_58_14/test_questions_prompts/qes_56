  "formatted_prompt": "Q: which one is odd?\n4377\n3954\n9865\n8454\n9831 Answer Choices: (A) 4377 (B) 3954 (C) 9865 (D) 8454 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. We need to determine which number is odd out of the given options. - 4377: This number ends in 7, which means it is odd. - 3954: This number ends in 4, which means it is even. - 9865: This number ends in 5, which means it is odd. - 8454: This number ends in 4, which means it is even. - 9831: This number ends in 1, which means it is odd. Therefore, the answer is (B) 3954, as it is the only even number among the options. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: if integer N has p factors ; how many factors will 5N have ? Answer Choices: (A) p (B) 2p (C) P+1 (D) 2p+1 (E) Cannot be determined\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that N has p factors. This means that N can be written as a product of p distinct prime numbers raised to various powers. For example, if N = 12, then N can be written as 2^2 * 3^1, which means that N has (2+1) * (1+1) = 6 factors (2 and 3 can each be raised to 0, 1, or 2). Now, let's consider 5N. 5N can be written as 5 * N, which means that 5N has one more factor than N (since 5 is a prime factor of 5N that wasn't present in N). Therefore, the answer is (C) p+1. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: 69 laboratories raise the bacterium, the laboratory have 48 culture dishes on average, which has about 25,075 bacteria each. How many bacteria are there approximately? Answer Choices: (A) 10^7 (B) 10^8 (C) 10^9 (D) 10^10 (E) 10^11\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of culture dishes in all the laboratories. Total number of culture dishes = 69 x 48 = 3312 Step 2: Find the total number of bacteria in all the culture dishes. Total number of bacteria = 3312 x 25,075 = 83,076,000 Step 3: Convert the total number of bacteria into scientific notation. 83,076,000 = 8.3076 x 10^7 Therefore, the answer is (A) 10^7. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: What is the smallest positive integer x such that 280-x is the cube of a positive integer Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 64 (C) 62 (D) 60 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. We are given that 280 - x is the cube of a positive integer. Let's call this positive integer y. So, we have: 280 - x = y^3 We want to find the smallest positive integer x that satisfies this equation. Let's try plugging in the answer choices for x and see which one gives us a perfect cube for y. A) If x = 5, then 280 - x = 275. 275 is not a perfect cube, so this is not the answer. B) If x = 64, then 280 - x = 216. 216 is a perfect cube (6^3), so this could be the answer. C) If x = 62, then 280 - x = 218. 218 is not a perfect cube, so this is not the answer. D) If x = 60, then 280 - x = 220. 220 is not a perfect cube, so this is not the answer. E) If x = 12, then 280 - x = 268. 268 is not a perfect cube, so this is not the answer. Therefore, the answer is (B) 64. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
