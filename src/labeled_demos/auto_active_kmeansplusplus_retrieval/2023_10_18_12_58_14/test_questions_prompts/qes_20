  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Jamboree and GMAT Club Contest Starts\nQUESTION #20:\nHow many words (with or without meaning) can be formed using all the letters of the word \u201cSELFIE\u201d so that the two E\u2019s are not together? Answer Choices: (A)  660 (B)  600 (C)  500 (D)  300 (E)  240\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of ways to arrange all the letters of the word \"SELFIE\". This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken all at a time, which is n!. In this case, n = 6, so the total number of arrangements is 6! = 720. Next, we need to subtract the number of arrangements where the two E's are together. To do this, we can treat the two E's as a single object and find the number of arrangements of the five objects \"S\", \"L\", \"F\", \"I\", and \"EE\". This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is nPr = n!/(n-r)!. In this case, n = 5 and r = 5, so the number of arrangements where the two E's are together is 5! = 120. Finally, we can subtract the number of arrangements where the two E's are together from the total number of arrangements to get the number of arrangements where the two E's are not together: 720 - 120 = 600. Therefore, the answer is (B) 600. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: 69 laboratories raise the bacterium, the laboratory have 48 culture dishes on average, which has about 25,075 bacteria each. How many bacteria are there approximately? Answer Choices: (A) 10^7 (B) 10^8 (C) 10^9 (D) 10^10 (E) 10^11\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of culture dishes in all the laboratories. Total number of culture dishes = 69 x 48 = 3312 Step 2: Find the total number of bacteria in all the culture dishes. Total number of bacteria = 3312 x 25,075 = 83,076,000 Step 3: Convert the total number of bacteria into scientific notation. 83,076,000 = 8.3076 x 10^7 Therefore, the answer is (A) 10^7. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: In aquarium A there are 2 yellow fish and 2 green ones, in aquarium B there are 3 yellow fish and 4 green ones. An aquarium is chosen at random, what is the probability of picking up a green fish out of aquarium A? Answer Choices: (A) 1/2. (B) 3/5. (C) 1/4. (D) 1/3. (E) 2/3.\nA: Let's think step by step. There are two aquariums, A and B. The probability of choosing aquarium A is 1/2 since there are only two options. Now, we need to find the probability of picking a green fish out of aquarium A. In aquarium A, there are a total of 4 fish (2 yellow and 2 green). So, the probability of picking a green fish out of aquarium A is 2/4 or 1/2. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1/2. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: In the parking lot there are 44 vehicles, 24 of them are buses, and the rest are cars. The color of 24 vehicles is red, of which 18 are buses. How many cars can be found in the parking lot which are not colored red? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 12 (C) 13 (D) 14 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that there are 44 vehicles in total, out of which 24 are buses. Therefore, the number of cars in the parking lot is: 44 - 24 = 20 Step 2: We also know that the color of 24 vehicles is red, out of which 18 are buses. Therefore, the number of cars that are colored red is: 24 - 18 = 6 Step 3: We need to find the number of cars that are not colored red. We know that there are 20 cars in total, out of which 6 are colored red. Therefore, the number of cars that are not colored red is: 20 - 6 = 14 Therefore, the answer is (D) 14. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
