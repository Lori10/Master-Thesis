  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A cistern is normally filled in 4 hrs,but takes 2 hrs longer to fill because of a leak on its bottom,if Cistern is full ,how much time citern would empty? Answer Choices: (A) 10 hours (B) 20 hours (C) 30 hours (D) 40 hours (E) 12 hours\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the cistern's capacity is 1 unit (it could be any unit of measurement). If there was no leak, the cistern would be filled in 4 hours. So, the rate of filling would be 1/4 units per hour. But because of the leak, it takes 2 hours longer to fill the cistern. So, the new time taken to fill the cistern is 4 + 2 = 6 hours. Let's assume that the leak can empty the cistern in x hours. Now, we can set up an equation based on the principle that the amount of water filled in the cistern is equal to the amount of water emptied by the leak when the cistern is full. Amount of water filled = Amount of water emptied Rate of filling x Time taken to fill = Rate of emptying x Time taken to empty 1 = (1/4) x 6 + (1/x) x t where t is the time taken to empty the cistern when it is full. Simplifying the equation, we get: 1 = (3/2) + (t/x) (t/x) = 1/2 t = (x/2) So, the time taken to empty the cistern when it is full is half the time taken by the leak to empty it. Since we don't know the time taken by the leak to empty the cistern, we cannot determine the exact answer. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: In a family 4 people eat only vegetarian, 3 people eat only non veg., 2 people eat both veg and non veg.. How many people are in the family? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 3 (C) 10 (D) 2 (E) 9\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that there are 4 people who eat only vegetarian, 3 people who eat only non-veg, and 2 people who eat both veg and non-veg. If we add up the number of people who eat only vegetarian and the number of people who eat both veg and non-veg, we get a total of 6 people. Similarly, if we add up the number of people who eat only non-veg and the number of people who eat both veg and non-veg, we get a total of 5 people. However, we have counted the 2 people who eat both veg and non-veg twice, so we need to subtract them once to get the total number of people in the family. Therefore, the total number of people in the family is 6 + 5 - 2 = 9. So the answer is (E) 9. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In how many different orders can the people Alice, Benjamin, Charlene, David, Elaine, Frederick, Gale, and Harold be standing on line if each of Alice, Benjamin, Charlene must be on the line before each of Frederick, Gale, and Harold? Answer Choices: (A) 1,008 (B) 1,296 (C) 1,512 (D) 2,016 (E) 2,268\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to arrange Alice, Benjamin, and Charlene in a line. This can be done in 3! = 6 ways. Next, we need to arrange Frederick, Gale, and Harold in a line. This can also be done in 3! = 6 ways. Now, we have 5 people left to arrange: David, Elaine, and the 3 groups of 3 people (ABC, FGH). We can think of these 5 people as 5 slots that need to be filled. The first slot can be filled by any of the 8 people. The second slot can be filled by any of the remaining 7 people. The third slot can be filled by any of the remaining 6 people. The fourth slot can be filled by any of the remaining 5 people. The fifth slot can be filled by any of the remaining 4 people. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange all 8 people is: 6 x 6 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 = 1,296 So the answer is (B) 1,296. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: It takes 40 identical printing presses 15 hours to print 500,000 papers. How many hours would it take 30 of these printing presses to print 500,000 papers? Answer Choices: (A) 16 (B) 18 (C) 20 (D) 21 (E) 24\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 40 printing presses can print 500,000 papers in 15 hours. So, we can find the rate of printing of each press by dividing the total number of papers by the total number of hours and the number of presses: Rate of each press = 500,000 / (40 x 15) = 833.33 papers per hour Now, we need to find how many hours it would take 30 printing presses to print 500,000 papers at the same rate. Total time = Total number of papers / (Rate of each press x Number of presses) Total time = 500,000 / (833.33 x 30) Total time = 20 hours Therefore, the answer is (C) 20. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
