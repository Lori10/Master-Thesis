  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Rajesh solved 80 per cent of the questions in an examination correctly. If out of 41 questions solved by Rajesh 37 questions are correct and of the remaining questions out of 8 questions 5 questions have been solved by Rajesh correctly then find the total number of questions asked in the examination. Answer Choices: (A) 75 (B) 65 (C) 60 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Rajesh solved 80% of the questions correctly. This means that he got 37 questions correct out of a total of x questions. We can write this as: 0.8x = 37 Solving for x, we get: x = 46.25 However, we know that the number of questions asked in the examination must be a whole number. Therefore, we can assume that the actual number of questions asked is either 46 or 47. Next, we know that Rajesh solved a total of 41 questions. Of these, 37 were correct and 4 were incorrect. This means that he attempted 8 - 4 = 4 questions in the remaining set of questions. We also know that he got 5 out of these 8 questions correct. Therefore, the total number of questions asked in the examination is: 37 + 4 + 5 = 46 So the answer is (A) 75. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Jamboree and GMAT Club Contest Starts\nQUESTION #20:\nHow many words (with or without meaning) can be formed using all the letters of the word \u201cSELFIE\u201d so that the two E\u2019s are not together? Answer Choices: (A)  660 (B)  600 (C)  500 (D)  300 (E)  240\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of ways to arrange all the letters of the word \"SELFIE\". This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken all at a time, which is n!. In this case, n = 6, so the total number of arrangements is 6! = 720. Next, we need to subtract the number of arrangements where the two E's are together. To do this, we can treat the two E's as a single object and find the number of arrangements of the five objects \"S\", \"L\", \"F\", \"I\", and \"EE\". This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is nPr = n!/(n-r)!. In this case, n = 5 and r = 5, so the number of arrangements where the two E's are together is 5! = 120. Finally, we can subtract the number of arrangements where the two E's are together from the total number of arrangements to get the number of arrangements where the two E's are not together: 720 - 120 = 600. Therefore, the answer is (B) 600. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: What is the smallest positive integer x such that 280-x is the cube of a positive integer Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 64 (C) 62 (D) 60 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. We are given that 280 - x is the cube of a positive integer. Let's call this positive integer y. So, we have: 280 - x = y^3 We want to find the smallest positive integer x that satisfies this equation. Let's try plugging in the answer choices for x and see which one gives us a perfect cube for y. A) If x = 5, then 280 - x = 275. 275 is not a perfect cube, so this is not the answer. B) If x = 64, then 280 - x = 216. 216 is a perfect cube (6^3), so this could be the answer. C) If x = 62, then 280 - x = 218. 218 is not a perfect cube, so this is not the answer. D) If x = 60, then 280 - x = 220. 220 is not a perfect cube, so this is not the answer. E) If x = 12, then 280 - x = 268. 268 is not a perfect cube, so this is not the answer. Therefore, the answer is (B) 64. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: It takes 40 identical printing presses 15 hours to print 500,000 papers. How many hours would it take 30 of these printing presses to print 500,000 papers? Answer Choices: (A) 16 (B) 18 (C) 20 (D) 21 (E) 24\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 40 printing presses can print 500,000 papers in 15 hours. So, we can find the rate of printing of each press by dividing the total number of papers by the total number of hours and the number of presses: Rate of each press = 500,000 / (40 x 15) = 833.33 papers per hour Now, we need to find how many hours it would take 30 printing presses to print 500,000 papers at the same rate. Total time = Total number of papers / (Rate of each press x Number of presses) Total time = 500,000 / (833.33 x 30) Total time = 20 hours Therefore, the answer is (C) 20. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
