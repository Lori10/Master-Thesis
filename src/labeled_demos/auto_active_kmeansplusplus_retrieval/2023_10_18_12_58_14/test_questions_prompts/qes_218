  "test_question": "Q: Julie\u2019s yard is rectangular. One side of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. What is the length of the other side of the yard? Answer Choices: (A) 30 feet (B) 20 feet (C) 10 feet (D) 50 feet (E) 60 feet",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The length of a rectangular plot is 20 metres more than its breadth. If the cost of fencing the plot @ Rs. 26.50 per metre is Rs. 7420, what is the length of the plot in metres? Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 200 (C) 300 (D) 400 (E) 80\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the breadth of the rectangular plot be x metres. Then, the length of the plot is (x+20) metres. The cost of fencing the plot is Rs. 26.50 per metre. Therefore, the total cost of fencing the rectangular plot is: Perimeter of the plot x Cost per metre = (2 x length + 2 x breadth) x 26.50 Substituting the values of length and breadth, we get: (2(x+20) + 2x) x 26.50 = 7420 Simplifying the equation, we get: 6.5x + 530 = 371 6.5x = 371 - 530 6.5x = -159 x = -24.46 Since the breadth cannot be negative, this answer is not possible. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A train crosses a platform of 120 m in 15 sec, same train crosses another platform of length 180 m in 18 sec. then find the length of the train? Answer Choices: (A) 877m (B) 180m (C) 786m (D) 165m (E) 456m\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the length of the train be x meters. In the first case, the train crosses a platform of 120 meters in 15 seconds. Therefore, the total distance covered by the train is (x + 120) meters in 15 seconds. In the second case, the train crosses a platform of 180 meters in 18 seconds. Therefore, the total distance covered by the train is (x + 180) meters in 18 seconds. We know that the speed of the train is constant in both cases. Therefore, we can equate the two distances and solve for x. (x + 120)/15 = (x + 180)/18 Solving this equation, we get x = 456 meters. Therefore, the length of the train is 456 meters. The correct answer is (E) 456m. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Of the 600 residents of Clermontville, 35% watch the television show Island Survival, 40% watch Lovelost Lawyers and 50% watch Medical Emergency. If all residents watch at least one of these three shows and 18% watch exactly 2 of these shows, then how many Clermontville residents B watch all of the shows? Answer Choices: (A)  150 (B)  108 (C)  42 (D)  21 (E)  -21\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of residents who watch at least one of the three shows. 35% + 40% + 50% = 125% This means that some residents are being counted twice or even thrice. To find the actual percentage, we need to subtract the percentage of residents who watch exactly two shows and the percentage of residents who watch all three shows. Step 2: Find the percentage of residents who watch exactly two shows. 125% - 18% = 107% Step 3: Find the percentage of residents who watch all three shows. 107% - 100% = 7% Step 4: Find the total number of residents who watch all three shows. 7% of 600 = 42 Therefore, the answer is (C) 42. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: At what time between 7 and 8 o\u2019clock will the hands of a clock be in the same straight line but, not together? Answer Choices: (A) 5 min. past 7 (B) 5 2\u204411 min. past 7 (C) 5 3\u204411 min. past 7 (D) 5 5\u204411 min. past 7 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. The hour hand moves 30 degrees in one hour (360 degrees divided by 12 hours) and 0.5 degrees in one minute (30 degrees divided by 60 minutes). The minute hand moves 6 degrees in one minute (360 degrees divided by 60 minutes). Let's assume that x minutes have passed since 7 o'clock. The angle between the hour and minute hand is given by: |0.5x - 30h|, where h is the hour hand position in degrees. At 7 o'clock, the hour hand is at 210 degrees (7 hours times 30 degrees). Substituting this value, we get: |0.5x - 210| - 6x = 0 Solving for x, we get: 0.5x - 210 = 6x or 0.5x - 210 = -6x Solving for x in both cases, we get: x = 252/11 or x = 210/11 The first solution corresponds to 5 7/11 minutes past 7 and the second solution corresponds to 5 2/11 minutes past 7. Therefore, the answer is (B) 5 2/11 min. past 7. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
