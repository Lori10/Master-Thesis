  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Angles AMB and CMD are right angles, \u2220AMD is acute, and \u2220BMC=y\u00b0 is acute. What is \u2220AMD ? Answer Choices: (A) 90\u00b0\u2212y (B) 180\u00b0\u2212y (C) 90\u00b0+y (D) 2y (E) y\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that angles AMB and CMD are right angles, which means they are both equal to 90 degrees. We also know that angle BMC is acute, which means it is less than 90 degrees. Since angles AMB and CMD are both right angles, they add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, angle AMD must be acute since it is less than 180 degrees. Now, let's use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. In triangle AMD, we have angles AMD, AMB, and CMD. AMD + AMB + CMD = 180 Substituting in the values we know: AMD + 90 + 90 = 180 Simplifying: AMD + 180 = 180 AMD = 0 This doesn't make sense since we know that angle AMD is acute. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: Let f(x) = x^2 + bx + c. If f(6) = 0 and f(-2) = 0, then b + c = Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 15 (C) -16 (D) -21 (E) -24\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that f(6) = 0 and f(-2) = 0. This means that when x = 6 and x = -2, the function f(x) equals zero. Using this information, we can set up two equations: (1) 6^2 + 6b + c = 0 (2) (-2)^2 - 2b + c = 0 Simplifying these equations: (1) 36 + 6b + c = 0 (2) 4 - 2b + c = 0 Now we can solve for b + c by adding the two equations together: 40 + 4b = 0 b = -10 Substituting b = -10 into either of the two equations above, we can solve for c: 36 + 6(-10) + c = 0 c = -6 Therefore, b + c = -10 - 6 = -16 The correct answer is (C) -16. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: At what time between 7 and 8 o\u2019clock will the hands of a clock be in the same straight line but, not together? Answer Choices: (A) 5 min. past 7 (B) 5 2\u204411 min. past 7 (C) 5 3\u204411 min. past 7 (D) 5 5\u204411 min. past 7 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. The hour hand moves 30 degrees in one hour (360 degrees divided by 12 hours) and 0.5 degrees in one minute (30 degrees divided by 60 minutes). The minute hand moves 6 degrees in one minute (360 degrees divided by 60 minutes). Let's assume that x minutes have passed since 7 o'clock. The angle between the hour and minute hand is given by: |0.5x - 30h|, where h is the hour hand position in degrees. At 7 o'clock, the hour hand is at 210 degrees (7 hours times 30 degrees). Substituting this value, we get: |0.5x - 210| - 6x = 0 Solving for x, we get: 0.5x - 210 = 6x or 0.5x - 210 = -6x Solving for x in both cases, we get: x = 252/11 or x = 210/11 The first solution corresponds to 5 7/11 minutes past 7 and the second solution corresponds to 5 2/11 minutes past 7. Therefore, the answer is (B) 5 2/11 min. past 7. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If north becomes south-west ant south-west becomes east and all the directions changed in the same manner,then what will be the direction for south-east? Answer Choices: (A) North-West (B) North-East (C) North (D) West (E) none\nA: Let's think step by step. If north becomes south-west, then south-west becomes north-east. Similarly, if south-west becomes east, then east becomes south. Therefore, we can conclude that south-east will become west. So, the correct answer is (D) West. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
