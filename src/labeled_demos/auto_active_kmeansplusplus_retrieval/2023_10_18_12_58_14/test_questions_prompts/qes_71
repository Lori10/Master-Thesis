  "test_question": "Q: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth? Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The length of a rectangular plot is 20 metres more than its breadth. If the cost of fencing the plot @ Rs. 26.50 per metre is Rs. 7420, what is the length of the plot in metres? Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 200 (C) 300 (D) 400 (E) 80\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the breadth of the rectangular plot be x metres. Then, the length of the plot is (x+20) metres. The cost of fencing the plot is Rs. 26.50 per metre. Therefore, the total cost of fencing the rectangular plot is: Perimeter of the plot x Cost per metre = (2 x length + 2 x breadth) x 26.50 Substituting the values of length and breadth, we get: (2(x+20) + 2x) x 26.50 = 7420 Simplifying the equation, we get: 6.5x + 530 = 371 6.5x = 371 - 530 6.5x = -159 x = -24.46 Since the breadth cannot be negative, this answer is not possible. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Rajesh solved 80 per cent of the questions in an examination correctly. If out of 41 questions solved by Rajesh 37 questions are correct and of the remaining questions out of 8 questions 5 questions have been solved by Rajesh correctly then find the total number of questions asked in the examination. Answer Choices: (A) 75 (B) 65 (C) 60 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Rajesh solved 80% of the questions correctly. This means that he got 37 questions correct out of a total of x questions. We can write this as: 0.8x = 37 Solving for x, we get: x = 46.25 However, we know that the number of questions asked in the examination must be a whole number. Therefore, we can assume that the actual number of questions asked is either 46 or 47. Next, we know that Rajesh solved a total of 41 questions. Of these, 37 were correct and 4 were incorrect. This means that he attempted 8 - 4 = 4 questions in the remaining set of questions. We also know that he got 5 out of these 8 questions correct. Therefore, the total number of questions asked in the examination is: 37 + 4 + 5 = 46 So the answer is (A) 75. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A train crosses a platform of 120 m in 15 sec, same train crosses another platform of length 180 m in 18 sec. then find the length of the train? Answer Choices: (A) 877m (B) 180m (C) 786m (D) 165m (E) 456m\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the length of the train be x meters. In the first case, the train crosses a platform of 120 meters in 15 seconds. Therefore, the total distance covered by the train is (x + 120) meters in 15 seconds. In the second case, the train crosses a platform of 180 meters in 18 seconds. Therefore, the total distance covered by the train is (x + 180) meters in 18 seconds. We know that the speed of the train is constant in both cases. Therefore, we can equate the two distances and solve for x. (x + 120)/15 = (x + 180)/18 Solving this equation, we get x = 456 meters. Therefore, the length of the train is 456 meters. The correct answer is (E) 456m. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A sports retailer ordered white and yellow tennis balls in equal number but the dispatch clerk of the tennis ball company erred and dispatched 50 extra yellow balls and making ratio of white balls to yellow balls 7/11. How many tennis balls did the retailer order originally. Answer Choices: (A) 17.5 (B) 130 (C) 175 (D) 195 (E) 220\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the retailer originally ordered x number of white and yellow tennis balls each. According to the problem, the dispatch clerk dispatched 50 extra yellow balls. So, the total number of yellow balls became (x + 50) and the number of white balls remained x. Now, the ratio of white balls to yellow balls is given as 7/11. So, we can write the equation: x/(x+50) = 7/11 Cross-multiplying, we get: 11x = 7(x+50) 11x = 7x + 350 4x = 350 x = 87.5 Therefore, the retailer originally ordered 87.5 white and 87.5 yellow tennis balls each. But since we need to find the total number of tennis balls, we add them up: 87.5 + 87.5 + 50 (extra yellow balls) = 225 So, the correct answer is (None of the above) 225. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
