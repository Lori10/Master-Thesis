  "test_question": "Q: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point. Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A train crosses a platform of 120 m in 15 sec, same train crosses another platform of length 180 m in 18 sec. then find the length of the train? Answer Choices: (A) 877m (B) 180m (C) 786m (D) 165m (E) 456m\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the length of the train be x meters. In the first case, the train crosses a platform of 120 meters in 15 seconds. Therefore, the total distance covered by the train is (x + 120) meters in 15 seconds. In the second case, the train crosses a platform of 180 meters in 18 seconds. Therefore, the total distance covered by the train is (x + 180) meters in 18 seconds. We know that the speed of the train is constant in both cases. Therefore, we can equate the two distances and solve for x. (x + 120)/15 = (x + 180)/18 Solving this equation, we get x = 456 meters. Therefore, the length of the train is 456 meters. The correct answer is (E) 456m. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A driver covers a certain distance by car driving at 60 km/hr and returns back to the starting point riding on a scooter at 10 km/hr. What was the average speed for the whole journey? Answer Choices: (A) 14.2 km/h (B) 17.1 km/h (C) 19.3 km/h (D) 21.7 km/h (E) 23.5 km/h\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the distance covered by the driver is 'd' km. The time taken to cover the distance by car at 60 km/hr is given by: Time taken = Distance/Speed = d/60 The time taken to cover the same distance by scooter at 10 km/hr is given by: Time taken = Distance/Speed = d/10 The total time taken for the whole journey is the sum of the time taken for the onward journey and the time taken for the return journey. Total time taken = d/60 + d/10 = (d + 6d)/60 = 7d/60 The average speed for the whole journey is given by: Average speed = Total distance/Total time taken Total distance = 2d (since the driver covers the same distance twice) Average speed = 2d/(7d/60) = 120/7 km/hr Rounding off to one decimal place, we get the answer as (A) 14.2 km/h. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: At what time between 7 and 8 o\u2019clock will the hands of a clock be in the same straight line but, not together? Answer Choices: (A) 5 min. past 7 (B) 5 2\u204411 min. past 7 (C) 5 3\u204411 min. past 7 (D) 5 5\u204411 min. past 7 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. The hour hand moves 30 degrees in one hour (360 degrees divided by 12 hours) and 0.5 degrees in one minute (30 degrees divided by 60 minutes). The minute hand moves 6 degrees in one minute (360 degrees divided by 60 minutes). Let's assume that x minutes have passed since 7 o'clock. The angle between the hour and minute hand is given by: |0.5x - 30h|, where h is the hour hand position in degrees. At 7 o'clock, the hour hand is at 210 degrees (7 hours times 30 degrees). Substituting this value, we get: |0.5x - 210| - 6x = 0 Solving for x, we get: 0.5x - 210 = 6x or 0.5x - 210 = -6x Solving for x in both cases, we get: x = 252/11 or x = 210/11 The first solution corresponds to 5 7/11 minutes past 7 and the second solution corresponds to 5 2/11 minutes past 7. Therefore, the answer is (B) 5 2/11 min. past 7. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A boat having a length 3 m and breadth 2 m is floating on a lake. The boat sinks by 1.2 cm when a man gets on it. The mass of man is Answer Choices: (A) 72 kg (B) 60 kg (C) 72 kg (D) 96 kg (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the volume of water displaced by the boat before the man gets on it. Volume of water displaced = length x breadth x height of displacement = 3m x 2m x 0.012m (1.2 cm converted to meters) = 0.072 cubic meters Now, when the man gets on the boat, the boat sinks by 1.2 cm more. So, the new height of displacement is 0.024m (0.012m + 0.012m). Let's assume the density of water is 1000 kg/m^3. The weight of water displaced by the boat before the man gets on it = volume of water displaced x density of water = 0.072m^3 x 1000 kg/m^3 = 72 kg The weight of water displaced by the boat after the man gets on it = (volume of water displaced + additional displacement due to the man) x density of water = (3m x 2m x 0.024m) x 1000 kg/m^3 = 1.44 kg Therefore, the weight of the man = weight of water displaced before the man gets on the boat - weight of water displaced after the man gets on the boat = 72 kg - 1.44 kg = 70.56 kg So, the answer is (E) None of the above. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
