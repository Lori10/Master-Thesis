  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Elena\u2019s bread recipe calls for 2 ounces of butter for each 5 cups of flour used. She needs to make 4 times the original recipe. If 12 ounces of butter is used, then how many cups of flour are needed? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 4 (C) 9 (D) 13 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much butter is needed for the new recipe. Since Elena needs to make 4 times the original recipe, she will need 4 x 2 = 8 ounces of butter. Next, we can set up a proportion to find out how much flour is needed. We know that for every 2 ounces of butter, 5 cups of flour are used. So, we can write: 2/5 = 8/x where x is the number of cups of flour needed for the new recipe. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 2x = 40 x = 20 Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In a family 4 people eat only vegetarian, 3 people eat only non veg., 2 people eat both veg and non veg.. How many people are in the family? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 3 (C) 10 (D) 2 (E) 9\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that there are 4 people who eat only vegetarian, 3 people who eat only non-veg, and 2 people who eat both veg and non-veg. If we add up the number of people who eat only vegetarian and the number of people who eat both veg and non-veg, we get a total of 6 people. Similarly, if we add up the number of people who eat only non-veg and the number of people who eat both veg and non-veg, we get a total of 5 people. However, we have counted the 2 people who eat both veg and non-veg twice, so we need to subtract them once to get the total number of people in the family. Therefore, the total number of people in the family is 6 + 5 - 2 = 9. So the answer is (E) 9. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In how many different orders can the people Alice, Benjamin, Charlene, David, Elaine, Frederick, Gale, and Harold be standing on line if each of Alice, Benjamin, Charlene must be on the line before each of Frederick, Gale, and Harold? Answer Choices: (A) 1,008 (B) 1,296 (C) 1,512 (D) 2,016 (E) 2,268\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to arrange Alice, Benjamin, and Charlene in a line. This can be done in 3! = 6 ways. Next, we need to arrange Frederick, Gale, and Harold in a line. This can also be done in 3! = 6 ways. Now, we have 5 people left to arrange: David, Elaine, and the 3 groups of 3 people (ABC, FGH). We can think of these 5 people as 5 slots that need to be filled. The first slot can be filled by any of the 8 people. The second slot can be filled by any of the remaining 7 people. The third slot can be filled by any of the remaining 6 people. The fourth slot can be filled by any of the remaining 5 people. The fifth slot can be filled by any of the remaining 4 people. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange all 8 people is: 6 x 6 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 = 1,296 So the answer is (B) 1,296. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In aquarium A there are 2 yellow fish and 2 green ones, in aquarium B there are 3 yellow fish and 4 green ones. An aquarium is chosen at random, what is the probability of picking up a green fish out of aquarium A? Answer Choices: (A) 1/2. (B) 3/5. (C) 1/4. (D) 1/3. (E) 2/3.\nA: Let's think step by step. There are two aquariums, A and B. The probability of choosing aquarium A is 1/2 since there are only two options. Now, we need to find the probability of picking a green fish out of aquarium A. In aquarium A, there are a total of 4 fish (2 yellow and 2 green). So, the probability of picking a green fish out of aquarium A is 2/4 or 1/2. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1/2. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
