  "test_question": "Q: At a conference, one team is made up of 4 men and 4 women. Four presenters are chosen to present the team's findings in front of the entire conference. How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only? (Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.) Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If there are 9 pairs of twins, and a committee will be formed with 3 members. In how many ways this committee formed in a way that no siblings in a group? Answer Choices: (A) 632 (B) 672 (C) 756 (D) 744 (E) 740\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We have 18 individuals (9 pairs of twins). Step 2: We need to choose 3 individuals for the committee. Step 3: We cannot choose any siblings in the same group. Step 4: To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Step 5: First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 individuals from 18, which is 18C3 = 816. Step 6: Next, we calculate the number of ways to choose 3 individuals with at least one pair of siblings in the same group. Step 7: There are 9 ways to choose one pair of siblings and one additional individual from the remaining 16 individuals (9*16 = 144). Step 8: There are 36 ways to choose two pairs of siblings (9C2) and one additional individual from the remaining 15 individuals (15 = 15). Step 9: However, we have counted the case where all three individuals are siblings twice, so we need to subtract this case once. Step 10: There are 9 ways to choose three siblings from the 9 pairs of twins (9C3). Step 11: Therefore, the number of ways to choose 3 individuals with at least one pair of siblings in the same group is 144 + 36 - 9 = 171. Step 12: Finally, we subtract this number from the total number of ways to choose 3 individuals to get the number of ways to choose 3 individuals with no siblings in the same group: 816 - 171 = 645. Step 13: None of the answer choices match our answer, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In how many different orders can the people Alice, Benjamin, Charlene, David, Elaine, Frederick, Gale, and Harold be standing on line if each of Alice, Benjamin, Charlene must be on the line before each of Frederick, Gale, and Harold? Answer Choices: (A) 1,008 (B) 1,296 (C) 1,512 (D) 2,016 (E) 2,268\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to arrange Alice, Benjamin, and Charlene in a line. This can be done in 3! = 6 ways. Next, we need to arrange Frederick, Gale, and Harold in a line. This can also be done in 3! = 6 ways. Now, we have 5 people left to arrange: David, Elaine, and the 3 groups of 3 people (ABC, FGH). We can think of these 5 people as 5 slots that need to be filled. The first slot can be filled by any of the 8 people. The second slot can be filled by any of the remaining 7 people. The third slot can be filled by any of the remaining 6 people. The fourth slot can be filled by any of the remaining 5 people. The fifth slot can be filled by any of the remaining 4 people. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange all 8 people is: 6 x 6 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 = 1,296 So the answer is (B) 1,296. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: The 30 members of a club decided to play a badminton singles tournament. Every time a member loses a game he is out of the tournament. There are no ties. What is the minimum number of matches that must be played to determine the winner ? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 29 (C) 64 (D) 39 (E) 35\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine how many rounds of matches will be played. Since each match eliminates one player, there will be 29 matches in the first round (30 players divided into 15 matches). After the first round, there will be 15 players left, so there will be 7 matches in the second round (8 players divided into 4 matches) and 4 matches in the third round (4 players divided into 2 matches). Finally, there will be one match in the fourth round to determine the winner. Therefore, the total number of matches played will be 29 + 7 + 4 + 1 = 41. None of the answer choices match our calculation, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: There is enough provisions for 2400 women in an army camp for 100 days. If there were 1200 men less, how long will the provision last? Answer Choices: (A) 170 (B) 180 (C) 190 (D) 200 (E) 210\nA: Let's think step by step. Given: - Provisions for 2400 women for 100 days - 1200 men less We need to find out how long the provisions will last. Let's assume that each person consumes the same amount of provisions per day. Total provisions = 2400 women x 100 days = 240,000 woman-days Now, if there were 1200 men less, the total number of people in the camp would be 2400 women - 1200 men = 1200 women. So, the provisions need to last for 1200 women for some number of days. Let's call the number of days the provisions will last for 1200 women \"x\". We know that the total amount of provisions is the same, so: 240,000 woman-days = 1200 women x days Solving for \"x\": x = 240,000 woman-days / 1200 women x = 200 days Therefore, the provisions will last for 200 days for 1200 women (or 2400 women and 1200 men). The correct answer is (D) 200. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
