  "test_question": "Q: Two numbers are said to be relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. Set S contains the set of integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: if integer N has p factors ; how many factors will 5N have ? Answer Choices: (A) p (B) 2p (C) P+1 (D) 2p+1 (E) Cannot be determined\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that N has p factors. This means that N can be written as a product of p distinct prime numbers raised to various powers. For example, if N = 12, then N can be written as 2^2 * 3^1, which means that N has (2+1) * (1+1) = 6 factors (2 and 3 can each be raised to 0, 1, or 2). Now, let's consider 5N. 5N can be written as 5 * N, which means that 5N has one more factor than N (since 5 is a prime factor of 5N that wasn't present in N). Therefore, the answer is (C) p+1. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If a and b are consecutive integers (b>a), which of the following statements could be false? 1. a^2+b is an even number. 2. ab is even number 3. (a + b) is always an odd number. Answer Choices: (A) II only (B) III only (C) I,II only (D) I only (E) I,III only\nA: Let's think step by step. If a and b are consecutive integers, then b = a + 1. 1. a^2 + b = a^2 + (a + 1) = (a^2 + a) + 1. Since a(a+1) is always even, the sum of an even number and 1 is always odd. Therefore, statement 1 is always true. 2. ab = a(a+1) is the product of two consecutive integers. One of them must be even and the other odd. Therefore, the product is always even. Statement 2 is always true. 3. a + b = a + (a+1) = 2a + 1. Since a is an integer, 2a is always even. Therefore, 2a + 1 is always odd. Statement 3 is always true. Therefore, none of the statements could be false. The answer is (E) None of the above. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: which one is odd?\n4377\n3954\n9865\n8454\n9831 Answer Choices: (A) 4377 (B) 3954 (C) 9865 (D) 8454 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. We need to determine which number is odd out of the given options. - 4377: This number ends in 7, which means it is odd. - 3954: This number ends in 4, which means it is even. - 9865: This number ends in 5, which means it is odd. - 8454: This number ends in 4, which means it is even. - 9831: This number ends in 1, which means it is odd. Therefore, the answer is (B) 3954, as it is the only even number among the options. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If there are 9 pairs of twins, and a committee will be formed with 3 members. In how many ways this committee formed in a way that no siblings in a group? Answer Choices: (A) 632 (B) 672 (C) 756 (D) 744 (E) 740\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We have 18 individuals (9 pairs of twins). Step 2: We need to choose 3 individuals for the committee. Step 3: We cannot choose any siblings in the same group. Step 4: To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Step 5: First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 individuals from 18, which is 18C3 = 816. Step 6: Next, we calculate the number of ways to choose 3 individuals with at least one pair of siblings in the same group. Step 7: There are 9 ways to choose one pair of siblings and one additional individual from the remaining 16 individuals (9*16 = 144). Step 8: There are 36 ways to choose two pairs of siblings (9C2) and one additional individual from the remaining 15 individuals (15 = 15). Step 9: However, we have counted the case where all three individuals are siblings twice, so we need to subtract this case once. Step 10: There are 9 ways to choose three siblings from the 9 pairs of twins (9C3). Step 11: Therefore, the number of ways to choose 3 individuals with at least one pair of siblings in the same group is 144 + 36 - 9 = 171. Step 12: Finally, we subtract this number from the total number of ways to choose 3 individuals to get the number of ways to choose 3 individuals with no siblings in the same group: 816 - 171 = 645. Step 13: None of the answer choices match our answer, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
