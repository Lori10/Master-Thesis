  "formatted_prompt": "Q: By selling 300 apples a seller gains the selling price of 60 apples. The gain percent of the seller is Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 88 (C) 25 (D) 27 (E) 19\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the selling price of one apple is $1. Therefore, the selling price of 300 apples is $300 and the selling price of 60 apples is $60. The seller gains the selling price of 60 apples, which is $60. Profit percent = (Profit/Cost Price) x 100 Here, the profit is $60 and the cost price is the selling price of 240 apples (300-60), which is $240. Profit percent = (60/240) x 100 = 25% Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 25. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Of the 600 residents of Clermontville, 35% watch the television show Island Survival, 40% watch Lovelost Lawyers and 50% watch Medical Emergency. If all residents watch at least one of these three shows and 18% watch exactly 2 of these shows, then how many Clermontville residents B watch all of the shows? Answer Choices: (A)  150 (B)  108 (C)  42 (D)  21 (E)  -21\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of residents who watch at least one of the three shows. 35% + 40% + 50% = 125% This means that some residents are being counted twice or even thrice. To find the actual percentage, we need to subtract the percentage of residents who watch exactly two shows and the percentage of residents who watch all three shows. Step 2: Find the percentage of residents who watch exactly two shows. 125% - 18% = 107% Step 3: Find the percentage of residents who watch all three shows. 107% - 100% = 7% Step 4: Find the total number of residents who watch all three shows. 7% of 600 = 42 Therefore, the answer is (C) 42. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Rajesh solved 80 per cent of the questions in an examination correctly. If out of 41 questions solved by Rajesh 37 questions are correct and of the remaining questions out of 8 questions 5 questions have been solved by Rajesh correctly then find the total number of questions asked in the examination. Answer Choices: (A) 75 (B) 65 (C) 60 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Rajesh solved 80% of the questions correctly. This means that he got 37 questions correct out of a total of x questions. We can write this as: 0.8x = 37 Solving for x, we get: x = 46.25 However, we know that the number of questions asked in the examination must be a whole number. Therefore, we can assume that the actual number of questions asked is either 46 or 47. Next, we know that Rajesh solved a total of 41 questions. Of these, 37 were correct and 4 were incorrect. This means that he attempted 8 - 4 = 4 questions in the remaining set of questions. We also know that he got 5 out of these 8 questions correct. Therefore, the total number of questions asked in the examination is: 37 + 4 + 5 = 46 So the answer is (A) 75. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: At a contest with 2,500 participants, 1/2 of the people are aged 10 to 12. Next year, the number of people aged 10 to 12 will increase by 1/5. After this change, what percentage of the total 2,500 people will the 10- to 12-year-olds represent? Answer Choices: (A) 55% (B) 60% (C) 50% (D) 45% (E) 66%\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 at the contest. 1/2 of 2,500 = 1,250 people aged 10 to 12. Step 2: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1/5 of 1,250 = 250 people increase. 1,250 + 250 = 1,500 people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. Step 3: Find the percentage of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1,500/2,500 x 100% = 60% Therefore, the answer is (B) 60%. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
