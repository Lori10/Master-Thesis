If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A boat having a length 3 m and breadth 2 m is floating on a lake. The boat sinks by 1.2 cm when a man gets on it. The mass of man is Answer Choices: (A) 72 kg (B) 60 kg (C) 72 kg (D) 96 kg (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the volume of water displaced by the boat before the man gets on it. Volume of water displaced = length x breadth x height of displacement = 3m x 2m x 0.012m (1.2 cm converted to meters) = 0.072 cubic meters Now, when the man gets on the boat, the boat sinks by 1.2 cm more. So, the new height of displacement is 0.024m (0.012m + 0.012m). Let's assume the density of water is 1000 kg/m^3. The weight of water displaced by the boat before the man gets on it = volume of water displaced x density of water = 0.072m^3 x 1000 kg/m^3 = 72 kg The weight of water displaced by the boat after the man gets on it = (volume of water displaced + additional displacement due to the man) x density of water = (3m x 2m x 0.024m) x 1000 kg/m^3 = 1.44 kg Therefore, the weight of the man = weight of water displaced before the man gets on the boat - weight of water displaced after the man gets on the boat = 72 kg - 1.44 kg = 70.56 kg So, the answer is (E) None of the above. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Solution A is 10% salt and Solution B is 80% salt. If you have 30 ounces of solution A and 60 ounces of solution B, in what ratio could you mix Solution A with Solution B to produce 50 ounces of a 50% salt solution? Answer Choices: (A) 6:4 (B) 6:14 (C) 3:4 (D) 4:6 (E) 3:7\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Calculate the amount of salt in Solution A and Solution B. - Solution A: 10% of 30 ounces = 3 ounces of salt - Solution B: 80% of 60 ounces = 48 ounces of salt Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the amount of salt in the final mixture. - Let x be the amount of Solution A needed to make 50 ounces of a 50% salt solution. - Then, (50 - x) is the amount of Solution B needed. - The equation is: 0.1x + 0.8(50 - x) = 0.5(50) Step 3: Solve for x. - 0.1x + 40 - 0.8x = 25 - -0.7x = -15 - x = 21.43 Step 4: Calculate the ratio of Solution A to Solution B. - Solution A: 21.43 ounces - Solution B: 50 - 21.43 = 28.57 ounces - Ratio of Solution A to Solution B = 21.43:28.57 = 3:4 Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 3:4. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Elena\u2019s bread recipe calls for 2 ounces of butter for each 5 cups of flour used. She needs to make 4 times the original recipe. If 12 ounces of butter is used, then how many cups of flour are needed? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 4 (C) 9 (D) 13 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much butter is needed for the new recipe. Since Elena needs to make 4 times the original recipe, she will need 4 x 2 = 8 ounces of butter. Next, we can set up a proportion to find out how much flour is needed. We know that for every 2 ounces of butter, 5 cups of flour are used. So, we can write: 2/5 = 8/x where x is the number of cups of flour needed for the new recipe. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 2x = 40 x = 20 Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In the formula V = 1/(2r)^2, if r is halved, then V is multiplied by Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 8 (C) 1 (D) 1/8 (E) 1/64\nA: Let's think step by step. The formula is V = 1/(2r)^2. If r is halved, then the new radius becomes r/2. Substituting this new value of r in the formula, we get: V = 1/(2(r/2))^2 V = 1/(r^2/2^2) V = 1/(r^2/4) V = 4/r^2 So, the new volume is 4/r^2 times the original volume. Therefore, if r is halved, V is multiplied by 4. The correct answer is (A) 2. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
