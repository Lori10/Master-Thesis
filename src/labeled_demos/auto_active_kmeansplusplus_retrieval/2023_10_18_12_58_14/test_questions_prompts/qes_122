  "formatted_prompt": "Q: By selling 300 apples a seller gains the selling price of 60 apples. The gain percent of the seller is Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 88 (C) 25 (D) 27 (E) 19\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the selling price of one apple is $1. Therefore, the selling price of 300 apples is $300 and the selling price of 60 apples is $60. The seller gains the selling price of 60 apples, which is $60. Profit percent = (Profit/Cost Price) x 100 Here, the profit is $60 and the cost price is the selling price of 240 apples (300-60), which is $240. Profit percent = (60/240) x 100 = 25% Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 25. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The cost price of a radio is Rs.1390 and it was sold for Rs.890, find the loss %?

Loss = Cost Price - Selling Price Loss = Rs. 1390 - Rs. 890 Loss = Rs. 500 To find the loss percentage, we need to calculate the loss as a percentage of the cost price. Loss Percentage = (Loss / Cost Price) x 100 Loss Percentage = (500 / 1390) x 100 Loss Percentage = 36% Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A reduction of 25% in the price of oil enables a house wife to obtain 5kgs more for Rs.1300, what is the reduced price for kg? Answer Choices: (A) s.40 (B) s.65 (C) s.49 (D) s.41 (E) s.42\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the original price per kg be x. After a 25% reduction, the new price per kg will be 0.75x. Let the original amount of oil purchased be y kg. With the reduction in price, the housewife can now purchase (y+5) kg for Rs.1300. So, we can set up the equation: y*x = (y+5)*(0.75x) Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.25xy = 5*0.75x 0.25y = 3 y = 12 So, the original amount of oil purchased was 12 kg. And the original price per kg was: 1300/12 = Rs.108.33 After a 25% reduction, the new price per kg is: 0.75*108.33 = Rs.81.25 Therefore, the reduced price for kg is option (None of the above). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: At a contest with 2,500 participants, 1/2 of the people are aged 10 to 12. Next year, the number of people aged 10 to 12 will increase by 1/5. After this change, what percentage of the total 2,500 people will the 10- to 12-year-olds represent? Answer Choices: (A) 55% (B) 60% (C) 50% (D) 45% (E) 66%\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 at the contest. 1/2 of 2,500 = 1,250 people aged 10 to 12. Step 2: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1/5 of 1,250 = 250 people increase. 1,250 + 250 = 1,500 people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. Step 3: Find the percentage of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1,500/2,500 x 100% = 60% Therefore, the answer is (B) 60%. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
