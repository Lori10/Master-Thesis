  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In a family 4 people eat only vegetarian, 3 people eat only non veg., 2 people eat both veg and non veg.. How many people are in the family? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 3 (C) 10 (D) 2 (E) 9\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that there are 4 people who eat only vegetarian, 3 people who eat only non-veg, and 2 people who eat both veg and non-veg. If we add up the number of people who eat only vegetarian and the number of people who eat both veg and non-veg, we get a total of 6 people. Similarly, if we add up the number of people who eat only non-veg and the number of people who eat both veg and non-veg, we get a total of 5 people. However, we have counted the 2 people who eat both veg and non-veg twice, so we need to subtract them once to get the total number of people in the family. Therefore, the total number of people in the family is 6 + 5 - 2 = 9. So the answer is (E) 9. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: There is enough provisions for 2400 women in an army camp for 100 days. If there were 1200 men less, how long will the provision last? Answer Choices: (A) 170 (B) 180 (C) 190 (D) 200 (E) 210\nA: Let's think step by step. Given: - Provisions for 2400 women for 100 days - 1200 men less We need to find out how long the provisions will last. Let's assume that each person consumes the same amount of provisions per day. Total provisions = 2400 women x 100 days = 240,000 woman-days Now, if there were 1200 men less, the total number of people in the camp would be 2400 women - 1200 men = 1200 women. So, the provisions need to last for 1200 women for some number of days. Let's call the number of days the provisions will last for 1200 women \"x\". We know that the total amount of provisions is the same, so: 240,000 woman-days = 1200 women x days Solving for \"x\": x = 240,000 woman-days / 1200 women x = 200 days Therefore, the provisions will last for 200 days for 1200 women (or 2400 women and 1200 men). The correct answer is (D) 200. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Rajesh solved 80 per cent of the questions in an examination correctly. If out of 41 questions solved by Rajesh 37 questions are correct and of the remaining questions out of 8 questions 5 questions have been solved by Rajesh correctly then find the total number of questions asked in the examination. Answer Choices: (A) 75 (B) 65 (C) 60 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Rajesh solved 80% of the questions correctly. This means that he got 37 questions correct out of a total of x questions. We can write this as: 0.8x = 37 Solving for x, we get: x = 46.25 However, we know that the number of questions asked in the examination must be a whole number. Therefore, we can assume that the actual number of questions asked is either 46 or 47. Next, we know that Rajesh solved a total of 41 questions. Of these, 37 were correct and 4 were incorrect. This means that he attempted 8 - 4 = 4 questions in the remaining set of questions. We also know that he got 5 out of these 8 questions correct. Therefore, the total number of questions asked in the examination is: 37 + 4 + 5 = 46 So the answer is (A) 75. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: In the parking lot there are 44 vehicles, 24 of them are buses, and the rest are cars. The color of 24 vehicles is red, of which 18 are buses. How many cars can be found in the parking lot which are not colored red? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 12 (C) 13 (D) 14 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that there are 44 vehicles in total, out of which 24 are buses. Therefore, the number of cars in the parking lot is: 44 - 24 = 20 Step 2: We also know that the color of 24 vehicles is red, out of which 18 are buses. Therefore, the number of cars that are colored red is: 24 - 18 = 6 Step 3: We need to find the number of cars that are not colored red. We know that there are 20 cars in total, out of which 6 are colored red. Therefore, the number of cars that are not colored red is: 20 - 6 = 14 Therefore, the answer is (D) 14. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
