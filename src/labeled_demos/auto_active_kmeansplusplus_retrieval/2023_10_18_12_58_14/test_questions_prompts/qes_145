  "formatted_prompt": "Q: At a contest with 2,500 participants, 1/2 of the people are aged 10 to 12. Next year, the number of people aged 10 to 12 will increase by 1/5. After this change, what percentage of the total 2,500 people will the 10- to 12-year-olds represent? Answer Choices: (A) 55% (B) 60% (C) 50% (D) 45% (E) 66%\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 at the contest. 1/2 of 2,500 = 1,250 people aged 10 to 12. Step 2: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1/5 of 1,250 = 250 people increase. 1,250 + 250 = 1,500 people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. Step 3: Find the percentage of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1,500/2,500 x 100% = 60% Therefore, the answer is (B) 60%. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Elena\u2019s bread recipe calls for 2 ounces of butter for each 5 cups of flour used. She needs to make 4 times the original recipe. If 12 ounces of butter is used, then how many cups of flour are needed? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 4 (C) 9 (D) 13 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much butter is needed for the new recipe. Since Elena needs to make 4 times the original recipe, she will need 4 x 2 = 8 ounces of butter. Next, we can set up a proportion to find out how much flour is needed. We know that for every 2 ounces of butter, 5 cups of flour are used. So, we can write: 2/5 = 8/x where x is the number of cups of flour needed for the new recipe. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 2x = 40 x = 20 Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Rajesh solved 80 per cent of the questions in an examination correctly. If out of 41 questions solved by Rajesh 37 questions are correct and of the remaining questions out of 8 questions 5 questions have been solved by Rajesh correctly then find the total number of questions asked in the examination. Answer Choices: (A) 75 (B) 65 (C) 60 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Rajesh solved 80% of the questions correctly. This means that he got 37 questions correct out of a total of x questions. We can write this as: 0.8x = 37 Solving for x, we get: x = 46.25 However, we know that the number of questions asked in the examination must be a whole number. Therefore, we can assume that the actual number of questions asked is either 46 or 47. Next, we know that Rajesh solved a total of 41 questions. Of these, 37 were correct and 4 were incorrect. This means that he attempted 8 - 4 = 4 questions in the remaining set of questions. We also know that he got 5 out of these 8 questions correct. Therefore, the total number of questions asked in the examination is: 37 + 4 + 5 = 46 So the answer is (A) 75. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: At what time between 7 and 8 o\u2019clock will the hands of a clock be in the same straight line but, not together? Answer Choices: (A) 5 min. past 7 (B) 5 2\u204411 min. past 7 (C) 5 3\u204411 min. past 7 (D) 5 5\u204411 min. past 7 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. The hour hand moves 30 degrees in one hour (360 degrees divided by 12 hours) and 0.5 degrees in one minute (30 degrees divided by 60 minutes). The minute hand moves 6 degrees in one minute (360 degrees divided by 60 minutes). Let's assume that x minutes have passed since 7 o'clock. The angle between the hour and minute hand is given by: |0.5x - 30h|, where h is the hour hand position in degrees. At 7 o'clock, the hour hand is at 210 degrees (7 hours times 30 degrees). Substituting this value, we get: |0.5x - 210| - 6x = 0 Solving for x, we get: 0.5x - 210 = 6x or 0.5x - 210 = -6x Solving for x in both cases, we get: x = 252/11 or x = 210/11 The first solution corresponds to 5 7/11 minutes past 7 and the second solution corresponds to 5 2/11 minutes past 7. Therefore, the answer is (B) 5 2/11 min. past 7. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
