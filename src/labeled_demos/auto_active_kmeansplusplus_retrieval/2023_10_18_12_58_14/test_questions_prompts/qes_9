  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Let f(x) = x^2 + bx + c. If f(6) = 0 and f(-2) = 0, then b + c = Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 15 (C) -16 (D) -21 (E) -24\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that f(6) = 0 and f(-2) = 0. This means that when x = 6 and x = -2, the function f(x) equals zero. Using this information, we can set up two equations: (1) 6^2 + 6b + c = 0 (2) (-2)^2 - 2b + c = 0 Simplifying these equations: (1) 36 + 6b + c = 0 (2) 4 - 2b + c = 0 Now we can solve for b + c by adding the two equations together: 40 + 4b = 0 b = -10 Substituting b = -10 into either of the two equations above, we can solve for c: 36 + 6(-10) + c = 0 c = -6 Therefore, b + c = -10 - 6 = -16 The correct answer is (C) -16. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: What is the smallest positive integer x such that 280-x is the cube of a positive integer Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 64 (C) 62 (D) 60 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. We are given that 280 - x is the cube of a positive integer. Let's call this positive integer y. So, we have: 280 - x = y^3 We want to find the smallest positive integer x that satisfies this equation. Let's try plugging in the answer choices for x and see which one gives us a perfect cube for y. A) If x = 5, then 280 - x = 275. 275 is not a perfect cube, so this is not the answer. B) If x = 64, then 280 - x = 216. 216 is a perfect cube (6^3), so this could be the answer. C) If x = 62, then 280 - x = 218. 218 is not a perfect cube, so this is not the answer. D) If x = 60, then 280 - x = 220. 220 is not a perfect cube, so this is not the answer. E) If x = 12, then 280 - x = 268. 268 is not a perfect cube, so this is not the answer. Therefore, the answer is (B) 64. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: if integer N has p factors ; how many factors will 5N have ? Answer Choices: (A) p (B) 2p (C) P+1 (D) 2p+1 (E) Cannot be determined\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that N has p factors. This means that N can be written as a product of p distinct prime numbers raised to various powers. For example, if N = 12, then N can be written as 2^2 * 3^1, which means that N has (2+1) * (1+1) = 6 factors (2 and 3 can each be raised to 0, 1, or 2). Now, let's consider 5N. 5N can be written as 5 * N, which means that 5N has one more factor than N (since 5 is a prime factor of 5N that wasn't present in N). Therefore, the answer is (C) p+1. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Which of the following inequalities has a solution set, when graphed on the number line, is a single line segment of finite length? Answer Choices: (A) 2 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (B) 3 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (C) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (D) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (E) 4 <= 3x+4 <= 6\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to isolate the variable (x) in the inequality. We can do this by subtracting 4 from all parts of the inequality: (A) 2 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes -2 <= 3x <= 2 (B) 3 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes -1 <= 3x <= 2 (C) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes 1 <= 3x <= 2 (D) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes 1 <= 3x <= 2 (E) 4 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes 0 <= 3x <= 2 Now we can divide all parts of the inequality by 3: (A) -2/3 <= x <= 2/3 (B) -1/3 <= x <= 2/3 (C) 1/3 <= x <= 2/3 (D) 1/3 <= x <= 2/3 (E) 0 <= x <= 2/3 Option (C) has a solution set that is a single line segment of finite length, from x=1/3 to x=2/3. Therefore, the correct answer is (C). The answer is C.\n\n\n"
