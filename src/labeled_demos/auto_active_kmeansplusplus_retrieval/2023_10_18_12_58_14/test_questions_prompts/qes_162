  "test_question": "Q: A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day? Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A sports retailer ordered white and yellow tennis balls in equal number but the dispatch clerk of the tennis ball company erred and dispatched 50 extra yellow balls and making ratio of white balls to yellow balls 7/11. How many tennis balls did the retailer order originally. Answer Choices: (A) 17.5 (B) 130 (C) 175 (D) 195 (E) 220\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the retailer originally ordered x number of white and yellow tennis balls each. According to the problem, the dispatch clerk dispatched 50 extra yellow balls. So, the total number of yellow balls became (x + 50) and the number of white balls remained x. Now, the ratio of white balls to yellow balls is given as 7/11. So, we can write the equation: x/(x+50) = 7/11 Cross-multiplying, we get: 11x = 7(x+50) 11x = 7x + 350 4x = 350 x = 87.5 Therefore, the retailer originally ordered 87.5 white and 87.5 yellow tennis balls each. But since we need to find the total number of tennis balls, we add them up: 87.5 + 87.5 + 50 (extra yellow balls) = 225 So, the correct answer is (None of the above) 225. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In aquarium A there are 2 yellow fish and 2 green ones, in aquarium B there are 3 yellow fish and 4 green ones. An aquarium is chosen at random, what is the probability of picking up a green fish out of aquarium A? Answer Choices: (A) 1/2. (B) 3/5. (C) 1/4. (D) 1/3. (E) 2/3.\nA: Let's think step by step. There are two aquariums, A and B. The probability of choosing aquarium A is 1/2 since there are only two options. Now, we need to find the probability of picking a green fish out of aquarium A. In aquarium A, there are a total of 4 fish (2 yellow and 2 green). So, the probability of picking a green fish out of aquarium A is 2/4 or 1/2. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1/2. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: In the parking lot there are 44 vehicles, 24 of them are buses, and the rest are cars. The color of 24 vehicles is red, of which 18 are buses. How many cars can be found in the parking lot which are not colored red? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 12 (C) 13 (D) 14 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that there are 44 vehicles in total, out of which 24 are buses. Therefore, the number of cars in the parking lot is: 44 - 24 = 20 Step 2: We also know that the color of 24 vehicles is red, out of which 18 are buses. Therefore, the number of cars that are colored red is: 24 - 18 = 6 Step 3: We need to find the number of cars that are not colored red. We know that there are 20 cars in total, out of which 6 are colored red. Therefore, the number of cars that are not colored red is: 20 - 6 = 14 Therefore, the answer is (D) 14. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: By selling 300 apples a seller gains the selling price of 60 apples. The gain percent of the seller is Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 88 (C) 25 (D) 27 (E) 19\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the selling price of one apple is $1. Therefore, the selling price of 300 apples is $300 and the selling price of 60 apples is $60. The seller gains the selling price of 60 apples, which is $60. Profit percent = (Profit/Cost Price) x 100 Here, the profit is $60 and the cost price is the selling price of 240 apples (300-60), which is $240. Profit percent = (60/240) x 100 = 25% Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 25. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
