  "formatted_prompt": "Q: It takes 40 identical printing presses 15 hours to print 500,000 papers. How many hours would it take 30 of these printing presses to print 500,000 papers? Answer Choices: (A) 16 (B) 18 (C) 20 (D) 21 (E) 24\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 40 printing presses can print 500,000 papers in 15 hours. So, we can find the rate of printing of each press by dividing the total number of papers by the total number of hours and the number of presses: Rate of each press = 500,000 / (40 x 15) = 833.33 papers per hour Now, we need to find how many hours it would take 30 printing presses to print 500,000 papers at the same rate. Total time = Total number of papers / (Rate of each press x Number of presses) Total time = 500,000 / (833.33 x 30) Total time = 20 hours Therefore, the answer is (C) 20. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The 30 members of a club decided to play a badminton singles tournament. Every time a member loses a game he is out of the tournament. There are no ties. What is the minimum number of matches that must be played to determine the winner ? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 29 (C) 64 (D) 39 (E) 35\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine how many rounds of matches will be played. Since each match eliminates one player, there will be 29 matches in the first round (30 players divided into 15 matches). After the first round, there will be 15 players left, so there will be 7 matches in the second round (8 players divided into 4 matches) and 4 matches in the third round (4 players divided into 2 matches). Finally, there will be one match in the fourth round to determine the winner. Therefore, the total number of matches played will be 29 + 7 + 4 + 1 = 41. None of the answer choices match our calculation, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A sports retailer ordered white and yellow tennis balls in equal number but the dispatch clerk of the tennis ball company erred and dispatched 50 extra yellow balls and making ratio of white balls to yellow balls 7/11. How many tennis balls did the retailer order originally. Answer Choices: (A) 17.5 (B) 130 (C) 175 (D) 195 (E) 220\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the retailer originally ordered x number of white and yellow tennis balls each. According to the problem, the dispatch clerk dispatched 50 extra yellow balls. So, the total number of yellow balls became (x + 50) and the number of white balls remained x. Now, the ratio of white balls to yellow balls is given as 7/11. So, we can write the equation: x/(x+50) = 7/11 Cross-multiplying, we get: 11x = 7(x+50) 11x = 7x + 350 4x = 350 x = 87.5 Therefore, the retailer originally ordered 87.5 white and 87.5 yellow tennis balls each. But since we need to find the total number of tennis balls, we add them up: 87.5 + 87.5 + 50 (extra yellow balls) = 225 So, the correct answer is (None of the above) 225. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A train crosses a platform of 120 m in 15 sec, same train crosses another platform of length 180 m in 18 sec. then find the length of the train? Answer Choices: (A) 877m (B) 180m (C) 786m (D) 165m (E) 456m\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the length of the train be x meters. In the first case, the train crosses a platform of 120 meters in 15 seconds. Therefore, the total distance covered by the train is (x + 120) meters in 15 seconds. In the second case, the train crosses a platform of 180 meters in 18 seconds. Therefore, the total distance covered by the train is (x + 180) meters in 18 seconds. We know that the speed of the train is constant in both cases. Therefore, we can equate the two distances and solve for x. (x + 120)/15 = (x + 180)/18 Solving this equation, we get x = 456 meters. Therefore, the length of the train is 456 meters. The correct answer is (E) 456m. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
