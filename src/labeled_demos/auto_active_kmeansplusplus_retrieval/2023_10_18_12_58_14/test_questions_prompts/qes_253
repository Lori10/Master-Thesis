  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In the formula V = 1/(2r)^2, if r is halved, then V is multiplied by Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 8 (C) 1 (D) 1/8 (E) 1/64\nA: Let's think step by step. The formula is V = 1/(2r)^2. If r is halved, then the new radius becomes r/2. Substituting this new value of r in the formula, we get: V = 1/(2(r/2))^2 V = 1/(r^2/2^2) V = 1/(r^2/4) V = 4/r^2 So, the new volume is 4/r^2 times the original volume. Therefore, if r is halved, V is multiplied by 4. The correct answer is (A) 2. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A boat having a length 3 m and breadth 2 m is floating on a lake. The boat sinks by 1.2 cm when a man gets on it. The mass of man is Answer Choices: (A) 72 kg (B) 60 kg (C) 72 kg (D) 96 kg (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the volume of water displaced by the boat before the man gets on it. Volume of water displaced = length x breadth x height of displacement = 3m x 2m x 0.012m (1.2 cm converted to meters) = 0.072 cubic meters Now, when the man gets on the boat, the boat sinks by 1.2 cm more. So, the new height of displacement is 0.024m (0.012m + 0.012m). Let's assume the density of water is 1000 kg/m^3. The weight of water displaced by the boat before the man gets on it = volume of water displaced x density of water = 0.072m^3 x 1000 kg/m^3 = 72 kg The weight of water displaced by the boat after the man gets on it = (volume of water displaced + additional displacement due to the man) x density of water = (3m x 2m x 0.024m) x 1000 kg/m^3 = 1.44 kg Therefore, the weight of the man = weight of water displaced before the man gets on the boat - weight of water displaced after the man gets on the boat = 72 kg - 1.44 kg = 70.56 kg So, the answer is (E) None of the above. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: What is the smallest positive integer x such that 280-x is the cube of a positive integer Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 64 (C) 62 (D) 60 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. We are given that 280 - x is the cube of a positive integer. Let's call this positive integer y. So, we have: 280 - x = y^3 We want to find the smallest positive integer x that satisfies this equation. Let's try plugging in the answer choices for x and see which one gives us a perfect cube for y. A) If x = 5, then 280 - x = 275. 275 is not a perfect cube, so this is not the answer. B) If x = 64, then 280 - x = 216. 216 is a perfect cube (6^3), so this could be the answer. C) If x = 62, then 280 - x = 218. 218 is not a perfect cube, so this is not the answer. D) If x = 60, then 280 - x = 220. 220 is not a perfect cube, so this is not the answer. E) If x = 12, then 280 - x = 268. 268 is not a perfect cube, so this is not the answer. Therefore, the answer is (B) 64. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In expressing a length of 102.472 km as nearly as possible with the three significant digits, find the percentage error Answer Choices: (A) 0.38% (B) 0.27% (C) 0.027% (D) 0.038% (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Determine the number of significant digits in the given length, which is 6. Step 2: Round off the length to three significant digits, which is 102 km. Step 3: Calculate the absolute error by subtracting the rounded value from the actual value: Absolute error = 102.472 km - 102 km = 0.472 km Step 4: Calculate the percentage error by dividing the absolute error by the actual value and multiplying by 100: Percentage error = (0.472 km / 102.472 km) x 100% = 0.46% None of the answer choices match the calculated percentage error, so the answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
