  "formatted_prompt": "Q: It takes 40 identical printing presses 15 hours to print 500,000 papers. How many hours would it take 30 of these printing presses to print 500,000 papers? Answer Choices: (A) 16 (B) 18 (C) 20 (D) 21 (E) 24\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 40 printing presses can print 500,000 papers in 15 hours. So, we can find the rate of printing of each press by dividing the total number of papers by the total number of hours and the number of presses: Rate of each press = 500,000 / (40 x 15) = 833.33 papers per hour Now, we need to find how many hours it would take 30 printing presses to print 500,000 papers at the same rate. Total time = Total number of papers / (Rate of each press x Number of presses) Total time = 500,000 / (833.33 x 30) Total time = 20 hours Therefore, the answer is (C) 20. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The average salary/head of all the workers ina workshop is Rs.850, if the average salary/head of 7technician is Rs.1000 and the average salary/head of the rest is Rs.780, the total no. of workers in the work-shop is ? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 23 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the total number of workers in the workshop be x. We know that the average salary/head of all workers is Rs. 850. So, the total salary of all workers = 850x. We also know that the average salary/head of 7 technicians is Rs. 1000. So, the total salary of these 7 technicians = 1000 x 7 = 7000. Now, we can find the total salary of the remaining workers by subtracting the total salary of the technicians from the total salary of all workers: Total salary of remaining workers = 850x - 7000. We also know that the average salary/head of the remaining workers is Rs. 780. So, we can set up an equation: (850x - 7000) / (x - 7) = 780 Solving for x, we get x = 22. Therefore, the total number of workers in the workshop is 22. The answer is (C) 22. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: At what time between 7 and 8 o\u2019clock will the hands of a clock be in the same straight line but, not together? Answer Choices: (A) 5 min. past 7 (B) 5 2\u204411 min. past 7 (C) 5 3\u204411 min. past 7 (D) 5 5\u204411 min. past 7 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. The hour hand moves 30 degrees in one hour (360 degrees divided by 12 hours) and 0.5 degrees in one minute (30 degrees divided by 60 minutes). The minute hand moves 6 degrees in one minute (360 degrees divided by 60 minutes). Let's assume that x minutes have passed since 7 o'clock. The angle between the hour and minute hand is given by: |0.5x - 30h|, where h is the hour hand position in degrees. At 7 o'clock, the hour hand is at 210 degrees (7 hours times 30 degrees). Substituting this value, we get: |0.5x - 210| - 6x = 0 Solving for x, we get: 0.5x - 210 = 6x or 0.5x - 210 = -6x Solving for x in both cases, we get: x = 252/11 or x = 210/11 The first solution corresponds to 5 7/11 minutes past 7 and the second solution corresponds to 5 2/11 minutes past 7. Therefore, the answer is (B) 5 2/11 min. past 7. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In how many different orders can the people Alice, Benjamin, Charlene, David, Elaine, Frederick, Gale, and Harold be standing on line if each of Alice, Benjamin, Charlene must be on the line before each of Frederick, Gale, and Harold? Answer Choices: (A) 1,008 (B) 1,296 (C) 1,512 (D) 2,016 (E) 2,268\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to arrange Alice, Benjamin, and Charlene in a line. This can be done in 3! = 6 ways. Next, we need to arrange Frederick, Gale, and Harold in a line. This can also be done in 3! = 6 ways. Now, we have 5 people left to arrange: David, Elaine, and the 3 groups of 3 people (ABC, FGH). We can think of these 5 people as 5 slots that need to be filled. The first slot can be filled by any of the 8 people. The second slot can be filled by any of the remaining 7 people. The third slot can be filled by any of the remaining 6 people. The fourth slot can be filled by any of the remaining 5 people. The fifth slot can be filled by any of the remaining 4 people. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange all 8 people is: 6 x 6 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 = 1,296 So the answer is (B) 1,296. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
