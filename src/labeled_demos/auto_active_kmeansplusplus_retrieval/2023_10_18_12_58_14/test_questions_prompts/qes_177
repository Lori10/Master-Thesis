  "test_question": "Q: A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate? Answer Choices: (A) 1.5% (B) 4.5% (C) 10% (D) 5% (E) 12%",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: What annual payment dischargea debit of Rs.12900, due in 4yrs.At 5% rate? Answer Choices: (A) 2300 (B) 2400 (C) 3000 (D) 3500 (E) 3600\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the formula for the present value of an annuity to solve this problem. The formula is: PV = A * (1 - (1 + r)^(-n)) / r where PV is the present value of the annuity, A is the annual payment, r is the interest rate per period, and n is the number of periods. In this case, we know that PV = Rs. 12900, r = 5% per year, and n = 4 years. We want to solve for A. Plugging in the values, we get: 12900 = A * (1 - (1 + 0.05)^(-4)) / 0.05 Simplifying the right-hand side, we get: 12900 = A * (1 - 0.8227) 12900 = A * 0.1773 A = 12900 / 0.1773 A = 72877.5 However, this is the total amount that would discharge the debt in one payment. We want to know the annual payment, so we need to divide by the number of years: Annual payment = 72877.5 / 4 Annual payment = 18219.375 None of the answer choices match this result, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: If $10,000 is invested at x percent simple annual interest for n years, which of the following represents the total amount of interest, in dollars, that will be earned by this investment in the n years? Answer Choices: (A) 10,000(x^n)  (B) 10,000(x/100) ^n (C) 10,000n(x/100)  (D) 10,000(1+x/100) ^n (E) 10,000n(1+x/100) \nA: Let's think step by step. The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time In this case, the principal is $10,000, the rate is x percent (which we need to convert to a decimal by dividing by 100), and the time is n years. So, the total amount of interest earned in n years is: Interest = 10,000 * (x/100) * n Simplifying this expression, we get: Interest = 100 * x * n Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 10,000n(x/100). The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Rajesh solved 80 per cent of the questions in an examination correctly. If out of 41 questions solved by Rajesh 37 questions are correct and of the remaining questions out of 8 questions 5 questions have been solved by Rajesh correctly then find the total number of questions asked in the examination. Answer Choices: (A) 75 (B) 65 (C) 60 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Rajesh solved 80% of the questions correctly. This means that he got 37 questions correct out of a total of x questions. We can write this as: 0.8x = 37 Solving for x, we get: x = 46.25 However, we know that the number of questions asked in the examination must be a whole number. Therefore, we can assume that the actual number of questions asked is either 46 or 47. Next, we know that Rajesh solved a total of 41 questions. Of these, 37 were correct and 4 were incorrect. This means that he attempted 8 - 4 = 4 questions in the remaining set of questions. We also know that he got 5 out of these 8 questions correct. Therefore, the total number of questions asked in the examination is: 37 + 4 + 5 = 46 So the answer is (A) 75. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The cost price of a radio is Rs.1390 and it was sold for Rs.890, find the loss %? Answer Choices: (A) 18% (B) 12% (C) 22% (D) 35% (E) 21%\nA: Let's think step by step. The cost price of the radio is Rs. 1390 and it was sold for Rs. 890. The loss incurred is the difference between the cost price and the selling price. Loss = Cost Price - Selling Price Loss = Rs. 1390 - Rs. 890 Loss = Rs. 500 To find the loss percentage, we need to calculate the loss as a percentage of the cost price. Loss Percentage = (Loss / Cost Price) x 100 Loss Percentage = (500 / 1390) x 100 Loss Percentage = 36% Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
