  "test_question": "Q: IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink? Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Solution A is 10% salt and Solution B is 80% salt. If you have 30 ounces of solution A and 60 ounces of solution B, in what ratio could you mix Solution A with Solution B to produce 50 ounces of a 50% salt solution? Answer Choices: (A) 6:4 (B) 6:14 (C) 3:4 (D) 4:6 (E) 3:7\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Calculate the amount of salt in Solution A and Solution B. - Solution A: 10% of 30 ounces = 3 ounces of salt - Solution B: 80% of 60 ounces = 48 ounces of salt Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the amount of salt in the final mixture. - Let x be the amount of Solution A needed to make 50 ounces of a 50% salt solution. - Then, (50 - x) is the amount of Solution B needed. - The equation is: 0.1x + 0.8(50 - x) = 0.5(50) Step 3: Solve for x. - 0.1x + 40 - 0.8x = 25 - -0.7x = -15 - x = 21.43 Step 4: Calculate the ratio of Solution A to Solution B. - Solution A: 21.43 ounces - Solution B: 50 - 21.43 = 28.57 ounces - Ratio of Solution A to Solution B = 21.43:28.57 = 3:4 Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 3:4. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A jar full of whisky contains 40% alcohol. A part of this whisky is replaced by another containg 19% alcohol and now the percentage of alcohol was found to be 22%. What quantity of whisky is replaced ? Answer Choices: (A) 1/3 (B) 2/3 (C) 2/5 (D) 3/5 (E) 4/5\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the jar initially contains 100 units of whisky. Out of these 100 units, 40 units are alcohol. Let's say x units of whisky are replaced with the new whisky containing 19% alcohol. So, the amount of alcohol in the new mixture will be: 40 - 0.4x (alcohol in the original mixture) + 0.19x (alcohol in the new mixture) The total amount of whisky in the new mixture will be: 100 - x (original amount) + x (new amount) Now, we are given that the percentage of alcohol in the new mixture is 22%. So, we can set up the equation: (40 - 0.4x + 0.19x)/(100) = 0.22 Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 2/5 Therefore, 2/5 of the original amount of whisky is replaced with the new whisky containing 19% alcohol. So, the answer is (C) 2/5. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: By selling 300 apples a seller gains the selling price of 60 apples. The gain percent of the seller is Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 88 (C) 25 (D) 27 (E) 19\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the selling price of one apple is $1. Therefore, the selling price of 300 apples is $300 and the selling price of 60 apples is $60. The seller gains the selling price of 60 apples, which is $60. Profit percent = (Profit/Cost Price) x 100 Here, the profit is $60 and the cost price is the selling price of 240 apples (300-60), which is $240. Profit percent = (60/240) x 100 = 25% Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 25. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A sports retailer ordered white and yellow tennis balls in equal number but the dispatch clerk of the tennis ball company erred and dispatched 50 extra yellow balls and making ratio of white balls to yellow balls 7/11. How many tennis balls did the retailer order originally. Answer Choices: (A) 17.5 (B) 130 (C) 175 (D) 195 (E) 220\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the retailer originally ordered x number of white and yellow tennis balls each. According to the problem, the dispatch clerk dispatched 50 extra yellow balls. So, the total number of yellow balls became (x + 50) and the number of white balls remained x. Now, the ratio of white balls to yellow balls is given as 7/11. So, we can write the equation: x/(x+50) = 7/11 Cross-multiplying, we get: 11x = 7(x+50) 11x = 7x + 350 4x = 350 x = 87.5 Therefore, the retailer originally ordered 87.5 white and 87.5 yellow tennis balls each. But since we need to find the total number of tennis balls, we add them up: 87.5 + 87.5 + 50 (extra yellow balls) = 225 So, the correct answer is (None of the above) 225. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
