  "test_question": "Q: A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted? Answer Choices: (A) 438 (B) 550 (C) 500 (D) 450 (E) 498",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: What is the smallest positive integer x such that 280-x is the cube of a positive integer Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 64 (C) 62 (D) 60 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. We are given that 280 - x is the cube of a positive integer. Let's call this positive integer y. So, we have: 280 - x = y^3 We want to find the smallest positive integer x that satisfies this equation. Let's try plugging in the answer choices for x and see which one gives us a perfect cube for y. A) If x = 5, then 280 - x = 275. 275 is not a perfect cube, so this is not the answer. B) If x = 64, then 280 - x = 216. 216 is a perfect cube (6^3), so this could be the answer. C) If x = 62, then 280 - x = 218. 218 is not a perfect cube, so this is not the answer. D) If x = 60, then 280 - x = 220. 220 is not a perfect cube, so this is not the answer. E) If x = 12, then 280 - x = 268. 268 is not a perfect cube, so this is not the answer. Therefore, the answer is (B) 64. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: It takes 40 identical printing presses 15 hours to print 500,000 papers. How many hours would it take 30 of these printing presses to print 500,000 papers? Answer Choices: (A) 16 (B) 18 (C) 20 (D) 21 (E) 24\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 40 printing presses can print 500,000 papers in 15 hours. So, we can find the rate of printing of each press by dividing the total number of papers by the total number of hours and the number of presses: Rate of each press = 500,000 / (40 x 15) = 833.33 papers per hour Now, we need to find how many hours it would take 30 printing presses to print 500,000 papers at the same rate. Total time = Total number of papers / (Rate of each press x Number of presses) Total time = 500,000 / (833.33 x 30) Total time = 20 hours Therefore, the answer is (C) 20. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In the formula V = 1/(2r)^2, if r is halved, then V is multiplied by Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 8 (C) 1 (D) 1/8 (E) 1/64\nA: Let's think step by step. The formula is V = 1/(2r)^2. If r is halved, then the new radius becomes r/2. Substituting this new value of r in the formula, we get: V = 1/(2(r/2))^2 V = 1/(r^2/2^2) V = 1/(r^2/4) V = 4/r^2 So, the new volume is 4/r^2 times the original volume. Therefore, if r is halved, V is multiplied by 4. The correct answer is (A) 2. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: In how many different orders can the people Alice, Benjamin, Charlene, David, Elaine, Frederick, Gale, and Harold be standing on line if each of Alice, Benjamin, Charlene must be on the line before each of Frederick, Gale, and Harold? Answer Choices: (A) 1,008 (B) 1,296 (C) 1,512 (D) 2,016 (E) 2,268\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to arrange Alice, Benjamin, and Charlene in a line. This can be done in 3! = 6 ways. Next, we need to arrange Frederick, Gale, and Harold in a line. This can also be done in 3! = 6 ways. Now, we have 5 people left to arrange: David, Elaine, and the 3 groups of 3 people (ABC, FGH). We can think of these 5 people as 5 slots that need to be filled. The first slot can be filled by any of the 8 people. The second slot can be filled by any of the remaining 7 people. The third slot can be filled by any of the remaining 6 people. The fourth slot can be filled by any of the remaining 5 people. The fifth slot can be filled by any of the remaining 4 people. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange all 8 people is: 6 x 6 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 = 1,296 So the answer is (B) 1,296. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
