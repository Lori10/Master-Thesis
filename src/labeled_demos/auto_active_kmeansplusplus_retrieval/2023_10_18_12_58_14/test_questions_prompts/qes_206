  "test_question": "Q: On dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, we get the same remainder. The sum of the digits of N is: Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11 (C) 12 (D) 13 (E) 14",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: which one is odd?\n4377\n3954\n9865\n8454\n9831 Answer Choices: (A) 4377 (B) 3954 (C) 9865 (D) 8454 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. We need to determine which number is odd out of the given options. - 4377: This number ends in 7, which means it is odd. - 3954: This number ends in 4, which means it is even. - 9865: This number ends in 5, which means it is odd. - 8454: This number ends in 4, which means it is even. - 9831: This number ends in 1, which means it is odd. Therefore, the answer is (B) 3954, as it is the only even number among the options. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: if integer N has p factors ; how many factors will 5N have ? Answer Choices: (A) p (B) 2p (C) P+1 (D) 2p+1 (E) Cannot be determined\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that N has p factors. This means that N can be written as a product of p distinct prime numbers raised to various powers. For example, if N = 12, then N can be written as 2^2 * 3^1, which means that N has (2+1) * (1+1) = 6 factors (2 and 3 can each be raised to 0, 1, or 2). Now, let's consider 5N. 5N can be written as 5 * N, which means that 5N has one more factor than N (since 5 is a prime factor of 5N that wasn't present in N). Therefore, the answer is (C) p+1. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If a and b are consecutive integers (b>a), which of the following statements could be false? 1. a^2+b is an even number. 2. ab is even number 3. (a + b) is always an odd number. Answer Choices: (A) II only (B) III only (C) I,II only (D) I only (E) I,III only\nA: Let's think step by step. If a and b are consecutive integers, then b = a + 1. 1. a^2 + b = a^2 + (a + 1) = (a^2 + a) + 1. Since a(a+1) is always even, the sum of an even number and 1 is always odd. Therefore, statement 1 is always true. 2. ab = a(a+1) is the product of two consecutive integers. One of them must be even and the other odd. Therefore, the product is always even. Statement 2 is always true. 3. a + b = a + (a+1) = 2a + 1. Since a is an integer, 2a is always even. Therefore, 2a + 1 is always odd. Statement 3 is always true. Therefore, none of the statements could be false. The answer is (E) None of the above. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: what is summation of [3^k(28Ck)] (summation range 28 to k=0) where 28Ck is the number of ways of choosing k items from 28 items?? Answer Choices: (A) 4^28 (B) 4^27 (C) 4^26 (D) 4^25 (E) 4^24\nA: Let's think step by step. We can simplify the expression using the binomial theorem: (1 + 3)^28 = 28C0 * 3^0 + 28C1 * 3^1 + 28C2 * 3^2 + ... + 28C28 * 3^28 Notice that the expression we want to find is the same as the sum of the terms on the right-hand side of the equation above, except that we start the summation at k = 0 instead of k = 28. So we can write: summation of [3^k(28Ck)] (summation range 28 to k=0) = (1 + 3)^28 - 28C0 * 3^0 - 28C1 * 3^1 - 28C2 * 3^2 - ... - 28C27 * 3^27 We can simplify this expression by noticing that: (1 + 3)^28 = 4^28 And: 28C0 * 3^0 = 1 28C1 * 3^1 = 28 * 3 28C2 * 3^2 = 28 * 27 / 2 * 9 ... 28C27 * 3^27 = 28 * 27 * ... * 2 * 3^27 / 2^27 So we have: summation of [3^k(28Ck)] (summation range 28 to k=0) = 4^28 - 1 - 28 * 3 - 28 * 27 / 2 * 9 - ... - 28 * 27 * ... * 2 * 3^27 / 2^27 This expression can be simplified further, but we can already see that the answer is not any of the given options. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
