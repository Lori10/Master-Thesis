  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A camera lens filter kit containing 5 filters sells for $52.50. If the filters are purchased individually, 2 of them are priced at $6.45 each, 2 at $11.05 each, 1 at $15.50. The amount saved by purchasing the kit is what percent of the total price of the 5 filters purchased individually? Answer Choices: (A) 3.76% (B) 4.76% (C) 5.76% (D) 6.76% (E) 7.76%\nA: Let's think step by step. The total cost of purchasing the filters individually is: 2 x $6.45 + 2 x $11.05 + $15.50 = $31.50 The cost of purchasing the kit is $52.50. The amount saved by purchasing the kit is: $31.50 - $52.50 = -$21.00 This means that purchasing the kit costs $21.00 more than purchasing the filters individually. To find the percentage of the total price saved by purchasing the kit, we need to divide the amount saved by the total cost of purchasing the filters individually and then multiply by 100: (-$21.00 / $31.50) x 100 = -66.67% This means that purchasing the kit costs 66.67% more than purchasing the filters individually. However, the question asks for the percentage of the total price saved, not the percentage of the total price increased. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: By selling 300 apples a seller gains the selling price of 60 apples. The gain percent of the seller is Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 88 (C) 25 (D) 27 (E) 19\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the selling price of one apple is $1. Therefore, the selling price of 300 apples is $300 and the selling price of 60 apples is $60. The seller gains the selling price of 60 apples, which is $60. Profit percent = (Profit/Cost Price) x 100 Here, the profit is $60 and the cost price is the selling price of 240 apples (300-60), which is $240. Profit percent = (60/240) x 100 = 25% Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 25. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: At a contest with 2,500 participants, 1/2 of the people are aged 10 to 12. Next year, the number of people aged 10 to 12 will increase by 1/5. After this change, what percentage of the total 2,500 people will the 10- to 12-year-olds represent? Answer Choices: (A) 55% (B) 60% (C) 50% (D) 45% (E) 66%\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 at the contest. 1/2 of 2,500 = 1,250 people aged 10 to 12. Step 2: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1/5 of 1,250 = 250 people increase. 1,250 + 250 = 1,500 people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. Step 3: Find the percentage of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1,500/2,500 x 100% = 60% Therefore, the answer is (B) 60%. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A reduction of 25% in the price of oil enables a house wife to obtain 5kgs more for Rs.1300, what is the reduced price for kg? Answer Choices: (A) s.40 (B) s.65 (C) s.49 (D) s.41 (E) s.42\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the original price per kg be x. After a 25% reduction, the new price per kg will be 0.75x. Let the original amount of oil purchased be y kg. With the reduction in price, the housewife can now purchase (y+5) kg for Rs.1300. So, we can set up the equation: y*x = (y+5)*(0.75x) Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.25xy = 5*0.75x 0.25y = 3 y = 12 So, the original amount of oil purchased was 12 kg. And the original price per kg was: 1300/12 = Rs.108.33 After a 25% reduction, the new price per kg is: 0.75*108.33 = Rs.81.25 Therefore, the reduced price for kg is option (None of the above). The answer is A.\n\n\n"
