  "test_question": "Q: On a map, the length of the road from Town F to Town G is measured to be 20 inches. On this map, 1/4 inch represents an actual distance of 10 miles. What is the actual distance, in miles, from Town F to Town G along this road? Answer Choices: (A) 800 (B) 720 (C) 960 (D) 1140 (E) 1160",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A train crosses a platform of 120 m in 15 sec, same train crosses another platform of length 180 m in 18 sec. then find the length of the train? Answer Choices: (A) 877m (B) 180m (C) 786m (D) 165m (E) 456m\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the length of the train be x meters. In the first case, the train crosses a platform of 120 meters in 15 seconds. Therefore, the total distance covered by the train is (x + 120) meters in 15 seconds. In the second case, the train crosses a platform of 180 meters in 18 seconds. Therefore, the total distance covered by the train is (x + 180) meters in 18 seconds. We know that the speed of the train is constant in both cases. Therefore, we can equate the two distances and solve for x. (x + 120)/15 = (x + 180)/18 Solving this equation, we get x = 456 meters. Therefore, the length of the train is 456 meters. The correct answer is (E) 456m. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: The length of a rectangular plot is 20 metres more than its breadth. If the cost of fencing the plot @ Rs. 26.50 per metre is Rs. 7420, what is the length of the plot in metres? Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 200 (C) 300 (D) 400 (E) 80\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the breadth of the rectangular plot be x metres. Then, the length of the plot is (x+20) metres. The cost of fencing the plot is Rs. 26.50 per metre. Therefore, the total cost of fencing the rectangular plot is: Perimeter of the plot x Cost per metre = (2 x length + 2 x breadth) x 26.50 Substituting the values of length and breadth, we get: (2(x+20) + 2x) x 26.50 = 7420 Simplifying the equation, we get: 6.5x + 530 = 371 6.5x = 371 - 530 6.5x = -159 x = -24.46 Since the breadth cannot be negative, this answer is not possible. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A driver covers a certain distance by car driving at 60 km/hr and returns back to the starting point riding on a scooter at 10 km/hr. What was the average speed for the whole journey? Answer Choices: (A) 14.2 km/h (B) 17.1 km/h (C) 19.3 km/h (D) 21.7 km/h (E) 23.5 km/h\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the distance covered by the driver is 'd' km. The time taken to cover the distance by car at 60 km/hr is given by: Time taken = Distance/Speed = d/60 The time taken to cover the same distance by scooter at 10 km/hr is given by: Time taken = Distance/Speed = d/10 The total time taken for the whole journey is the sum of the time taken for the onward journey and the time taken for the return journey. Total time taken = d/60 + d/10 = (d + 6d)/60 = 7d/60 The average speed for the whole journey is given by: Average speed = Total distance/Total time taken Total distance = 2d (since the driver covers the same distance twice) Average speed = 2d/(7d/60) = 120/7 km/hr Rounding off to one decimal place, we get the answer as (A) 14.2 km/h. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: In expressing a length of 102.472 km as nearly as possible with the three significant digits, find the percentage error Answer Choices: (A) 0.38% (B) 0.27% (C) 0.027% (D) 0.038% (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Determine the number of significant digits in the given length, which is 6. Step 2: Round off the length to three significant digits, which is 102 km. Step 3: Calculate the absolute error by subtracting the rounded value from the actual value: Absolute error = 102.472 km - 102 km = 0.472 km Step 4: Calculate the percentage error by dividing the absolute error by the actual value and multiplying by 100: Percentage error = (0.472 km / 102.472 km) x 100% = 0.46% None of the answer choices match the calculated percentage error, so the answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
