  "formatted_prompt": "Q: By selling 300 apples a seller gains the selling price of 60 apples. The gain percent of the seller is Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 88 (C) 25 (D) 27 (E) 19\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the selling price of one apple is $1. Therefore, the selling price of 300 apples is $300 and the selling price of 60 apples is $60. The seller gains the selling price of 60 apples, which is $60. Profit percent = (Profit/Cost Price) x 100 Here, the profit is $60 and the cost price is the selling price of 240 apples (300-60), which is $240. Profit percent = (60/240) x 100 = 25% Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 25. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The value of a machine depreciates at 22% per annum. If its present value is $1,50,000, at what price should it be sold after two years such that a profit of $24,000 is made? Answer Choices: (A) $255260 (B) $435260 (C) $125260 (D) $115260 (E) $155260\nA: Let's think step by step. The machine depreciates at 22% per annum, which means its value decreases by 22% every year. After two years, the value of the machine will be: $1,50,000 x (1 - 0.22) x (1 - 0.22) = $1,50,000 x 0.78 x 0.78 = $87,156 To make a profit of $24,000, the machine should be sold for: $87,156 + $24,000 = $1,11,156 Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above, as none of the given options match the calculated value of $1,11,156. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The cost price of a radio is Rs.1390 and it was sold for Rs.890, find the loss %? Answer Choices: (A) 18% (B) 12% (C) 22% (D) 35% (E) 21%\nA: Let's think step by step. The cost price of the radio is Rs. 1390 and it was sold for Rs. 890. The loss incurred is the difference between the cost price and the selling price. Loss = Cost Price - Selling Price Loss = Rs. 1390 - Rs. 890 Loss = Rs. 500 To find the loss percentage, we need to calculate the loss as a percentage of the cost price. Loss Percentage = (Loss / Cost Price) x 100 Loss Percentage = (500 / 1390) x 100 Loss Percentage = 36% Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A meal cost $ 37.25 adn there was no tax. If the tip was more than 10 pc but less than 15pc of the price, then the total amount paid should be: Answer Choices: (A) 42-45 (B) 41-43 (C) 39-41 (D) 37-39 (E) 36-37\nA: Let's think step by step. The meal cost is $37.25 and there is no tax. Let's assume the tip is x% of the meal cost. So, the total amount paid will be: $37.25 + (x/100)*$37.25 Simplifying this expression: $37.25*(1 + x/100)$ We know that the tip is more than 10% but less than 15% of the price. So, 10% < x < 15% Let's substitute the values of x in the expression we derived above: For x = 10%, the total amount paid will be: $37.25*(1 + 10/100) = $41. For x = 15%, the total amount paid will be: $37.25*(1 + 15/100) = $42.79. Therefore, the total amount paid should be between $41 and $42.79. The closest answer choice is (A) 42-45. So, the correct answer is (A) 42-45. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
