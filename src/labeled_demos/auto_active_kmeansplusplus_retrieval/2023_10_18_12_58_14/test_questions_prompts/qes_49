  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The average salary/head of all the workers ina workshop is Rs.850, if the average salary/head of 7technician is Rs.1000 and the average salary/head of the rest is Rs.780, the total no. of workers in the work-shop is ? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 23 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the total number of workers in the workshop be x. We know that the average salary/head of all workers is Rs. 850. So, the total salary of all workers = 850x. We also know that the average salary/head of 7 technicians is Rs. 1000. So, the total salary of these 7 technicians = 1000 x 7 = 7000. Now, we can find the total salary of the remaining workers by subtracting the total salary of the technicians from the total salary of all workers: Total salary of remaining workers = 850x - 7000. We also know that the average salary/head of the remaining workers is Rs. 780. So, we can set up an equation: (850x - 7000) / (x - 7) = 780 Solving for x, we get x = 22. Therefore, the total number of workers in the workshop is 22. The answer is (C) 22. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: John has Rs 360 for his expenses. If he exceeds his days by 4 days he must cut down daily expenses by Rs 3. The number of days of John 's tour program is Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 15 (C) 20 (D) 24 (E) 27\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that John's tour program is for x days. If he sticks to his budget, his daily expenses would be 360/x. If he exceeds his days by 4 days, he would have to cut down his daily expenses by Rs 3. This means his new daily expenses would be (360/(x+4)) - 3. We can set up an equation: 360/x = (360/(x+4)) - 3 Multiplying both sides by x(x+4), we get: 360(x+4) = 360x - 3x(x+4) Simplifying, we get: 1440 = -3x^2 + 48x + 1440 Rearranging, we get: 3x^2 - 48x = 0 Dividing both sides by 3x, we get: x - 16 = 0 Therefore, x = 16. So John's tour program is for 16 days. The answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: The cost price of a radio is Rs.1390 and it was sold for Rs.890, find the loss %? Answer Choices: (A) 18% (B) 12% (C) 22% (D) 35% (E) 21%\nA: Let's think step by step. The cost price of the radio is Rs. 1390 and it was sold for Rs. 890. The loss incurred is the difference between the cost price and the selling price. Loss = Cost Price - Selling Price Loss = Rs. 1390 - Rs. 890 Loss = Rs. 500 To find the loss percentage, we need to calculate the loss as a percentage of the cost price. Loss Percentage = (Loss / Cost Price) x 100 Loss Percentage = (500 / 1390) x 100 Loss Percentage = 36% Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A reduction of 25% in the price of oil enables a house wife to obtain 5kgs more for Rs.1300, what is the reduced price for kg? Answer Choices: (A) s.40 (B) s.65 (C) s.49 (D) s.41 (E) s.42\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the original price per kg be x. After a 25% reduction, the new price per kg will be 0.75x. Let the original amount of oil purchased be y kg. With the reduction in price, the housewife can now purchase (y+5) kg for Rs.1300. So, we can set up the equation: y*x = (y+5)*(0.75x) Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.25xy = 5*0.75x 0.25y = 3 y = 12 So, the original amount of oil purchased was 12 kg. And the original price per kg was: 1300/12 = Rs.108.33 After a 25% reduction, the new price per kg is: 0.75*108.33 = Rs.81.25 Therefore, the reduced price for kg is option (None of the above). The answer is A.\n\n\n"
