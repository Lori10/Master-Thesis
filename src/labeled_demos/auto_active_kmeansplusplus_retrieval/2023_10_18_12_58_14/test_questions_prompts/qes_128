If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD? Answer Choices: (A) 80\u00b0 (B) 130\u00b0 (C) 140\u00b0 (D) 160\u00b0 (E) 220\u00b0",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Angles AMB and CMD are right angles, \u2220AMD is acute, and \u2220BMC=y\u00b0 is acute. What is \u2220AMD ? Answer Choices: (A) 90\u00b0\u2212y (B) 180\u00b0\u2212y (C) 90\u00b0+y (D) 2y (E) y\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that angles AMB and CMD are right angles, which means they are both equal to 90 degrees. We also know that angle BMC is acute, which means it is less than 90 degrees. Since angles AMB and CMD are both right angles, they add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, angle AMD must be acute since it is less than 180 degrees. Now, let's use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. In triangle AMD, we have angles AMD, AMB, and CMD. AMD + AMB + CMD = 180 Substituting in the values we know: AMD + 90 + 90 = 180 Simplifying: AMD + 180 = 180 AMD = 0 This doesn't make sense since we know that angle AMD is acute. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: At what time between 7 and 8 o\u2019clock will the hands of a clock be in the same straight line but, not together? Answer Choices: (A) 5 min. past 7 (B) 5 2\u204411 min. past 7 (C) 5 3\u204411 min. past 7 (D) 5 5\u204411 min. past 7 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. The hour hand moves 30 degrees in one hour (360 degrees divided by 12 hours) and 0.5 degrees in one minute (30 degrees divided by 60 minutes). The minute hand moves 6 degrees in one minute (360 degrees divided by 60 minutes). Let's assume that x minutes have passed since 7 o'clock. The angle between the hour and minute hand is given by: |0.5x - 30h|, where h is the hour hand position in degrees. At 7 o'clock, the hour hand is at 210 degrees (7 hours times 30 degrees). Substituting this value, we get: |0.5x - 210| - 6x = 0 Solving for x, we get: 0.5x - 210 = 6x or 0.5x - 210 = -6x Solving for x in both cases, we get: x = 252/11 or x = 210/11 The first solution corresponds to 5 7/11 minutes past 7 and the second solution corresponds to 5 2/11 minutes past 7. Therefore, the answer is (B) 5 2/11 min. past 7. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In the formula V = 1/(2r)^2, if r is halved, then V is multiplied by Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 8 (C) 1 (D) 1/8 (E) 1/64\nA: Let's think step by step. The formula is V = 1/(2r)^2. If r is halved, then the new radius becomes r/2. Substituting this new value of r in the formula, we get: V = 1/(2(r/2))^2 V = 1/(r^2/2^2) V = 1/(r^2/4) V = 4/r^2 So, the new volume is 4/r^2 times the original volume. Therefore, if r is halved, V is multiplied by 4. The correct answer is (A) 2. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: In expressing a length of 102.472 km as nearly as possible with the three significant digits, find the percentage error Answer Choices: (A) 0.38% (B) 0.27% (C) 0.027% (D) 0.038% (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Determine the number of significant digits in the given length, which is 6. Step 2: Round off the length to three significant digits, which is 102 km. Step 3: Calculate the absolute error by subtracting the rounded value from the actual value: Absolute error = 102.472 km - 102 km = 0.472 km Step 4: Calculate the percentage error by dividing the absolute error by the actual value and multiplying by 100: Percentage error = (0.472 km / 102.472 km) x 100% = 0.46% None of the answer choices match the calculated percentage error, so the answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
