  "formatted_prompt": "Q: It takes 40 identical printing presses 15 hours to print 500,000 papers. How many hours would it take 30 of these printing presses to print 500,000 papers? Answer Choices: (A) 16 (B) 18 (C) 20 (D) 21 (E) 24\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 40 printing presses can print 500,000 papers in 15 hours. So, we can find the rate of printing of each press by dividing the total number of papers by the total number of hours and the number of presses: Rate of each press = 500,000 / (40 x 15) = 833.33 papers per hour Now, we need to find how many hours it would take 30 printing presses to print 500,000 papers at the same rate. Total time = Total number of papers / (Rate of each press x Number of presses) Total time = 500,000 / (833.33 x 30) Total time = 20 hours Therefore, the answer is (C) 20. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Curious Elva asked her father what he would gift for her nineteenth birthday.

If the tip was more than 10 pc but less than 15pc of the price, then the total amount paid should be: Answer Choices: (A) 42-45 (B) 41-43 (C) 39-41 (D) 37-39 (E) 36-37\nA: Let's think step by step. The meal cost is $37.25 and there is no tax. Let's assume the tip is x% of the meal cost. So, the total amount paid will be: $37.25 + (x/100)*$37.25 Simplifying this expression: $37.25*(1 + x/100)$ We know that the tip is more than 10% but less than 15% of the price. So, 10% < x < 15% Let's substitute the values of x in the expression we derived above: For x = 10%, the total amount paid will be: $37.25*(1 + 10/100) = $41. For x = 15%, the total amount paid will be: $37.25*(1 + 15/100) = $42.79. Therefore, the total amount paid should be between $41 and $42.79. The closest answer choice is (A) 42-45. So, the correct answer is (A) 42-45. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: John has Rs 360 for his expenses. If he exceeds his days by 4 days he must cut down daily expenses by Rs 3. The number of days of John 's tour program is Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 15 (C) 20 (D) 24 (E) 27\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that John's tour program is for x days. If he sticks to his budget, his daily expenses would be 360/x. If he exceeds his days by 4 days, he would have to cut down his daily expenses by Rs 3. This means his new daily expenses would be (360/(x+4)) - 3. We can set up an equation: 360/x = (360/(x+4)) - 3 Multiplying both sides by x(x+4), we get: 360(x+4) = 360x - 3x(x+4) Simplifying, we get: 1440 = -3x^2 + 48x + 1440 Rearranging, we get: 3x^2 - 48x = 0 Dividing both sides by 3x, we get: x - 16 = 0 Therefore, x = 16. So John's tour program is for 16 days. The answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
