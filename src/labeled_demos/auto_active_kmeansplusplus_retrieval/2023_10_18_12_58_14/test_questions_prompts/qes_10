We need to determine which number is odd out of the given options. - 4377: This number ends in 7, which means it is odd. - 3954: This number ends in 4, which means it is even. - 9865: This number ends in 5, which means it is odd. - 8454: This number ends in 4, which means it is even. - 9831: This number ends in 1, which means it is odd. Therefore, the answer is (B) 3954, as it is the only even number among the options. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: if integer N has p factors ; how many factors will 5N have ? Answer Choices: (A) p (B) 2p (C) P+1 (D) 2p+1 (E) Cannot be determined\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that N has p factors. This means that N can be written as a product of p distinct prime numbers raised to various powers. For example, if N = 12, then N can be written as 2^2 * 3^1, which means that N has (2+1) * (1+1) = 6 factors (2 and 3 can each be raised to 0, 1, or 2). Now, let's consider 5N. 5N can be written as 5 * N, which means that 5N has one more factor than N (since 5 is a prime factor of 5N that wasn't present in N). Therefore, the answer is (C) p+1. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In how many different orders can the people Alice, Benjamin, Charlene, David, Elaine, Frederick, Gale, and Harold be standing on line if each of Alice, Benjamin, Charlene must be on the line before each of Frederick, Gale, and Harold? Answer Choices: (A) 1,008 (B) 1,296 (C) 1,512 (D) 2,016 (E) 2,268\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to arrange Alice, Benjamin, and Charlene in a line. This can be done in 3! = 6 ways. Next, we need to arrange Frederick, Gale, and Harold in a line. This can also be done in 3! = 6 ways. Now, we have 5 people left to arrange: David, Elaine, and the 3 groups of 3 people (ABC, FGH). We can think of these 5 people as 5 slots that need to be filled. The first slot can be filled by any of the 8 people. The second slot can be filled by any of the remaining 7 people. The third slot can be filled by any of the remaining 6 people. The fourth slot can be filled by any of the remaining 5 people. The fifth slot can be filled by any of the remaining 4 people. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange all 8 people is: 6 x 6 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 = 1,296 So the answer is (B) 1,296. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If a and b are consecutive integers (b>a), which of the following statements could be false? 1. a^2+b is an even number. 2. ab is even number 3. (a + b) is always an odd number. Answer Choices: (A) II only (B) III only (C) I,II only (D) I only (E) I,III only\nA: Let's think step by step. If a and b are consecutive integers, then b = a + 1. 1. a^2 + b = a^2 + (a + 1) = (a^2 + a) + 1. Since a(a+1) is always even, the sum of an even number and 1 is always odd. Therefore, statement 1 is always true. 2. ab = a(a+1) is the product of two consecutive integers. One of them must be even and the other odd. Therefore, the product is always even. Statement 2 is always true. 3. a + b = a + (a+1) = 2a + 1. Since a is an integer, 2a is always even. Therefore, 2a + 1 is always odd. Statement 3 is always true. Therefore, none of the statements could be false. The answer is (E) None of the above. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
