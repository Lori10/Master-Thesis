  "formatted_prompt": "Q: It takes 40 identical printing presses 15 hours to print 500,000 papers. How many hours would it take 30 of these printing presses to print 500,000 papers? Answer Choices: (A) 16 (B) 18 (C) 20 (D) 21 (E) 24\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 40 printing presses can print 500,000 papers in 15 hours. So, we can find the rate of printing of each press by dividing the total number of papers by the total number of hours and the number of presses: Rate of each press = 500,000 / (40 x 15) = 833.33 papers per hour Now, we need to find how many hours it would take 30 printing presses to print 500,000 papers at the same rate. Total time = Total number of papers / (Rate of each press x Number of presses) Total time = 500,000 / (833.33 x 30) Total time = 20 hours Therefore, the answer is (C) 20. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: John has Rs 360 for his expenses. If he exceeds his days by 4 days he must cut down daily expenses by Rs 3. The number of days of John 's tour program is Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 15 (C) 20 (D) 24 (E) 27\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that John's tour program is for x days. If he sticks to his budget, his daily expenses would be 360/x. If he exceeds his days by 4 days, he would have to cut down his daily expenses by Rs 3. This means his new daily expenses would be (360/(x+4)) - 3. We can set up an equation: 360/x = (360/(x+4)) - 3 Multiplying both sides by x(x+4), we get: 360(x+4) = 360x - 3x(x+4) Simplifying, we get: 1440 = -3x^2 + 48x + 1440 Rearranging, we get: 3x^2 - 48x = 0 Dividing both sides by 3x, we get: x - 16 = 0 Therefore, x = 16. So John's tour program is for 16 days. The answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: In the parking lot there are 44 vehicles, 24 of them are buses, and the rest are cars. The color of 24 vehicles is red, of which 18 are buses. How many cars can be found in the parking lot which are not colored red? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 12 (C) 13 (D) 14 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that there are 44 vehicles in total, out of which 24 are buses. Therefore, the number of cars in the parking lot is: 44 - 24 = 20 Step 2: We also know that the color of 24 vehicles is red, out of which 18 are buses. Therefore, the number of cars that are colored red is: 24 - 18 = 6 Step 3: We need to find the number of cars that are not colored red. We know that there are 20 cars in total, out of which 6 are colored red. Therefore, the number of cars that are not colored red is: 20 - 6 = 14 Therefore, the answer is (D) 14. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: In 2010, Arman\u2019s birthday was on a Thursday. What day of the week was it 69 days after his birthday? Answer Choices: (A) Thursday (B) Wednesday (C) Saturday (D) Sunday (E) Monday\nA: Let's think step by step. Arman's birthday was on a Thursday in 2010. We need to find out what day of the week it was 69 days after his birthday. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide 69 by 7 to see how many full weeks have passed. 69 \u00f7 7 = 9 with a remainder of 6. This means that 9 full weeks have passed, and we are 6 days into the 10th week. Starting from Thursday, we count 6 days forward to find the answer. Thursday \u2192 Friday \u2192 Saturday \u2192 Sunday \u2192 Monday \u2192 Tuesday \u2192 Wednesday Therefore, the answer is (B) Wednesday. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
