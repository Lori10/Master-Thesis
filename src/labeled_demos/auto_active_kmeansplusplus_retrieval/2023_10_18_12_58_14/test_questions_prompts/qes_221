  "test_question": "Q: There is well of depth 30m and frog is at bottom of the well. He jumps 3m up one day and falls back 2m down the same day. How many days will it take for the frog to come out of the well? Answer Choices: (A) 25 days (B) 26 days (C) 27 days (D) 28 days (E) 29 days",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A boat having a length 3 m and breadth 2 m is floating on a lake. The boat sinks by 1.2 cm when a man gets on it. The mass of man is Answer Choices: (A) 72 kg (B) 60 kg (C) 72 kg (D) 96 kg (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the volume of water displaced by the boat before the man gets on it. Volume of water displaced = length x breadth x height of displacement = 3m x 2m x 0.012m (1.2 cm converted to meters) = 0.072 cubic meters Now, when the man gets on the boat, the boat sinks by 1.2 cm more. So, the new height of displacement is 0.024m (0.012m + 0.012m). Let's assume the density of water is 1000 kg/m^3. The weight of water displaced by the boat before the man gets on it = volume of water displaced x density of water = 0.072m^3 x 1000 kg/m^3 = 72 kg The weight of water displaced by the boat after the man gets on it = (volume of water displaced + additional displacement due to the man) x density of water = (3m x 2m x 0.024m) x 1000 kg/m^3 = 1.44 kg Therefore, the weight of the man = weight of water displaced before the man gets on the boat - weight of water displaced after the man gets on the boat = 72 kg - 1.44 kg = 70.56 kg So, the answer is (E) None of the above. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A cistern is normally filled in 4 hrs,but takes 2 hrs longer to fill because of a leak on its bottom,if Cistern is full ,how much time citern would empty? Answer Choices: (A) 10 hours (B) 20 hours (C) 30 hours (D) 40 hours (E) 12 hours\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the cistern's capacity is 1 unit (it could be any unit of measurement). If there was no leak, the cistern would be filled in 4 hours. So, the rate of filling would be 1/4 units per hour. But because of the leak, it takes 2 hours longer to fill the cistern. So, the new time taken to fill the cistern is 4 + 2 = 6 hours. Let's assume that the leak can empty the cistern in x hours. Now, we can set up an equation based on the principle that the amount of water filled in the cistern is equal to the amount of water emptied by the leak when the cistern is full. Amount of water filled = Amount of water emptied Rate of filling x Time taken to fill = Rate of emptying x Time taken to empty 1 = (1/4) x 6 + (1/x) x t where t is the time taken to empty the cistern when it is full. Simplifying the equation, we get: 1 = (3/2) + (t/x) (t/x) = 1/2 t = (x/2) So, the time taken to empty the cistern when it is full is half the time taken by the leak to empty it. Since we don't know the time taken by the leak to empty the cistern, we cannot determine the exact answer. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The 30 members of a club decided to play a badminton singles tournament. Every time a member loses a game he is out of the tournament. There are no ties. What is the minimum number of matches that must be played to determine the winner ? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 29 (C) 64 (D) 39 (E) 35\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine how many rounds of matches will be played. Since each match eliminates one player, there will be 29 matches in the first round (30 players divided into 15 matches). After the first round, there will be 15 players left, so there will be 7 matches in the second round (8 players divided into 4 matches) and 4 matches in the third round (4 players divided into 2 matches). Finally, there will be one match in the fourth round to determine the winner. Therefore, the total number of matches played will be 29 + 7 + 4 + 1 = 41. None of the answer choices match our calculation, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: In 2010, Arman\u2019s birthday was on a Thursday. What day of the week was it 69 days after his birthday? Answer Choices: (A) Thursday (B) Wednesday (C) Saturday (D) Sunday (E) Monday\nA: Let's think step by step. Arman's birthday was on a Thursday in 2010. We need to find out what day of the week it was 69 days after his birthday. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide 69 by 7 to see how many full weeks have passed. 69 \u00f7 7 = 9 with a remainder of 6. This means that 9 full weeks have passed, and we are 6 days into the 10th week. Starting from Thursday, we count 6 days forward to find the answer. Thursday \u2192 Friday \u2192 Saturday \u2192 Sunday \u2192 Monday \u2192 Tuesday \u2192 Wednesday Therefore, the answer is (B) Wednesday. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
