  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Ayesha's father was 38 years of age when she was born while her mother was 36 years old when her brother six years younger to her was born. What is the difference between the ages of her parents? Answer Choices: (A) 2 years (B) 4 years (C) 6 years (D) 7 years (E) 8 years\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We know that Ayesha's father was 38 years old when she was born. Let's call his age F. We also know that Ayesha's mother was 36 years old when her brother, who is six years younger than Ayesha, was born. Let's call her mother's age M. So, Ayesha's brother's age would be (Ayesha's age - 6). Let's call his age B. Now, we can set up two equations: F = Ayesha's age + 38 M = (Ayesha's age - 6) + 36 Simplifying the second equation, we get: M = Ayesha's age + 30 Now, we can set the two equations equal to each other and solve for Ayesha's age: Ayesha's age + 38 = Ayesha's age + 30 8 = 0 This is not possible, so none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: Rajesh solved 80 per cent of the questions in an examination correctly. If out of 41 questions solved by Rajesh 37 questions are correct and of the remaining questions out of 8 questions 5 questions have been solved by Rajesh correctly then find the total number of questions asked in the examination. Answer Choices: (A) 75 (B) 65 (C) 60 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Rajesh solved 80% of the questions correctly. This means that he got 37 questions correct out of a total of x questions. We can write this as: 0.8x = 37 Solving for x, we get: x = 46.25 However, we know that the number of questions asked in the examination must be a whole number. Therefore, we can assume that the actual number of questions asked is either 46 or 47. Next, we know that Rajesh solved a total of 41 questions. Of these, 37 were correct and 4 were incorrect. This means that he attempted 8 - 4 = 4 questions in the remaining set of questions. We also know that he got 5 out of these 8 questions correct. Therefore, the total number of questions asked in the examination is: 37 + 4 + 5 = 46 So the answer is (A) 75. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A batsman in his 17th innings makes a score of 85 and their by increasing his average by 3. What is his average after the 17thinnings? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 77 (C) 26 (D) 37 (E) 88\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the batsman's average before the 17th innings be x. So, the total runs scored by the batsman in his first 16 innings would be 16x. After the 17th innings, the total runs scored by the batsman would be (16x + 85). Now, we know that the batsman's average increased by 3 after the 17th innings. So, we can set up the equation: (16x + 85)/(17) = (x + 3) Solving for x, we get: x = 22 Therefore, the batsman's average after the 17th innings would be: (16x + 85)/(17) = (16*22 + 85)/(17) = 37 So, the correct answer is (D) 37. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: In 2010, Arman\u2019s birthday was on a Thursday. What day of the week was it 69 days after his birthday? Answer Choices: (A) Thursday (B) Wednesday (C) Saturday (D) Sunday (E) Monday\nA: Let's think step by step. Arman's birthday was on a Thursday in 2010. We need to find out what day of the week it was 69 days after his birthday. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide 69 by 7 to see how many full weeks have passed. 69 \u00f7 7 = 9 with a remainder of 6. This means that 9 full weeks have passed, and we are 6 days into the 10th week. Starting from Thursday, we count 6 days forward to find the answer. Thursday \u2192 Friday \u2192 Saturday \u2192 Sunday \u2192 Monday \u2192 Tuesday \u2192 Wednesday Therefore, the answer is (B) Wednesday. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
