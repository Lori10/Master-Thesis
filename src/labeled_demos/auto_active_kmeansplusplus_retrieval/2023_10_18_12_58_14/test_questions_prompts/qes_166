  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The value of a machine depreciates at 22% per annum. If its present value is $1,50,000, at what price should it be sold after two years such that a profit of $24,000 is made? Answer Choices: (A) $255260 (B) $435260 (C) $125260 (D) $115260 (E) $155260\nA: Let's think step by step. The machine depreciates at 22% per annum, which means its value decreases by 22% every year. After two years, the value of the machine will be: $1,50,000 x (1 - 0.22) x (1 - 0.22) = $1,50,000 x 0.78 x 0.78 = $87,156 To make a profit of $24,000, the machine should be sold for: $87,156 + $24,000 = $1,11,156 Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above, as none of the given options match the calculated value of $1,11,156. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A reduction of 25% in the price of oil enables a house wife to obtain 5kgs more for Rs.1300, what is the reduced price for kg? Answer Choices: (A) s.40 (B) s.65 (C) s.49 (D) s.41 (E) s.42\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the original price per kg be x. After a 25% reduction, the new price per kg will be 0.75x. Let the original amount of oil purchased be y kg. With the reduction in price, the housewife can now purchase (y+5) kg for Rs.1300. So, we can set up the equation: y*x = (y+5)*(0.75x) Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.25xy = 5*0.75x 0.25y = 3 y = 12 So, the original amount of oil purchased was 12 kg. And the original price per kg was: 1300/12 = Rs.108.33 After a 25% reduction, the new price per kg is: 0.75*108.33 = Rs.81.25 Therefore, the reduced price for kg is option (None of the above). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The average salary/head of all the workers ina workshop is Rs.850, if the average salary/head of 7technician is Rs.1000 and the average salary/head of the rest is Rs.780, the total no. of workers in the work-shop is ? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 23 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the total number of workers in the workshop be x. We know that the average salary/head of all workers is Rs. 850. So, the total salary of all workers = 850x. We also know that the average salary/head of 7 technicians is Rs. 1000. So, the total salary of these 7 technicians = 1000 x 7 = 7000. Now, we can find the total salary of the remaining workers by subtracting the total salary of the technicians from the total salary of all workers: Total salary of remaining workers = 850x - 7000. We also know that the average salary/head of the remaining workers is Rs. 780. So, we can set up an equation: (850x - 7000) / (x - 7) = 780 Solving for x, we get x = 22. Therefore, the total number of workers in the workshop is 22. The answer is (C) 22. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The cost price of a radio is Rs.1390 and it was sold for Rs.890, find the loss %? Answer Choices: (A) 18% (B) 12% (C) 22% (D) 35% (E) 21%\nA: Let's think step by step. The cost price of the radio is Rs. 1390 and it was sold for Rs. 890. The loss incurred is the difference between the cost price and the selling price. Loss = Cost Price - Selling Price Loss = Rs. 1390 - Rs. 890 Loss = Rs. 500 To find the loss percentage, we need to calculate the loss as a percentage of the cost price. Loss Percentage = (Loss / Cost Price) x 100 Loss Percentage = (500 / 1390) x 100 Loss Percentage = 36% Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
