  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If y/(x - z) = (y + x)/z = x/y then find x : y : z ? Answer Choices: (A) 1 : 2 : 3 (B) 3 : 2 : 1 (C) 4 : 2 : 3 (D) 2 : 4 : 7 (E) none of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can simplify the second ratio by cross-multiplying to get z(y + x) = (y)(y + x), which simplifies to y^2 = zx. Next, we can substitute this expression for y^2 into the first ratio to get y/(x - z) = (y + x)/z = x/zx^(1/2). Simplifying this expression, we get y = x^(3/2)/(x - z) and z = x^(1/2)/(x - z). Now, we can substitute these expressions for y and z into the ratio y^2 : x : z to get x^(3/2)/(x - z)^2 : x : x^(1/2)/(x - z). Simplifying this expression, we get x^(5/2) : x(x - z)^2 : x^(3/2)(x - z). Cancelling out an x from each term, we get x^(3/2) : (x - z)^2 : x^(1/2). Now, we can substitute the expression for z from earlier (z = x^(1/2)/(x - z)) into this ratio to get x^(3/2) : (x - x^(1/2))^2 : x^(1/2). Simplifying this expression, we get x^(3/2) : (x^2 - 2x^(3/2) + x) : x^(1/2). Finally, we can simplify the middle term by expanding the square and combining like terms to get x^(3/2) : (x^2 - 2x^(3/2) + x) : x^(1/2) = x^(3/2) : (x^2 - x^(3/2)) : x^(1/2) = x^(1/2) : (x - 1) : 1. Therefore, the answer is (E) none of these, since none of the given answer choices match the ratio x^(1/2) : (x - 1) : 1. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A jar full of whisky contains 40% alcohol. A part of this whisky is replaced by another containg 19% alcohol and now the percentage of alcohol was found to be 22%. What quantity of whisky is replaced ? Answer Choices: (A) 1/3 (B) 2/3 (C) 2/5 (D) 3/5 (E) 4/5\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the jar initially contains 100 units of whisky. Out of these 100 units, 40 units are alcohol. Let's say x units of whisky are replaced with the new whisky containing 19% alcohol. So, the amount of alcohol in the new mixture will be: 40 - 0.4x (alcohol in the original mixture) + 0.19x (alcohol in the new mixture) The total amount of whisky in the new mixture will be: 100 - x (original amount) + x (new amount) Now, we are given that the percentage of alcohol in the new mixture is 22%. So, we can set up the equation: (40 - 0.4x + 0.19x)/(100) = 0.22 Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 2/5 Therefore, 2/5 of the original amount of whisky is replaced with the new whisky containing 19% alcohol. So, the answer is (C) 2/5. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A reduction of 25% in the price of oil enables a house wife to obtain 5kgs more for Rs.1300, what is the reduced price for kg? Answer Choices: (A) s.40 (B) s.65 (C) s.49 (D) s.41 (E) s.42\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the original price per kg be x. After a 25% reduction, the new price per kg will be 0.75x. Let the original amount of oil purchased be y kg. With the reduction in price, the housewife can now purchase (y+5) kg for Rs.1300. So, we can set up the equation: y*x = (y+5)*(0.75x) Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.25xy = 5*0.75x 0.25y = 3 y = 12 So, the original amount of oil purchased was 12 kg. And the original price per kg was: 1300/12 = Rs.108.33 After a 25% reduction, the new price per kg is: 0.75*108.33 = Rs.81.25 Therefore, the reduced price for kg is option (None of the above). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: At a contest with 2,500 participants, 1/2 of the people are aged 10 to 12. Next year, the number of people aged 10 to 12 will increase by 1/5. After this change, what percentage of the total 2,500 people will the 10- to 12-year-olds represent? Answer Choices: (A) 55% (B) 60% (C) 50% (D) 45% (E) 66%\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 at the contest. 1/2 of 2,500 = 1,250 people aged 10 to 12. Step 2: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1/5 of 1,250 = 250 people increase. 1,250 + 250 = 1,500 people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. Step 3: Find the percentage of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1,500/2,500 x 100% = 60% Therefore, the answer is (B) 60%. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
