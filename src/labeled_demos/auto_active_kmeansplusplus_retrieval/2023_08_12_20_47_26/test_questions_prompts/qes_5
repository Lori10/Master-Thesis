  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Mitzel spent 35% of her allowance. If she spent $14, how much money is left in her allowance?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nIf 35% represents 14, then 100-35 = 65 represents the amount left of her allowance.\nThe amount she didn't use is 65*14/35 = <<65*14/35=26>>26 The answer is 26.\n\n\nQ: 4 friends are running a 4 x 100 relay race.  Mary ran first and took twice as long as Susan.  Susan ran second and she took 10 seconds longer than Jen.  Jen ran third and finished in 30 seconds.  Tiffany ran the last leg and finished in 7 seconds less than Mary.  How many seconds did it take the team to finish the race?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nSusan's time was 30 seconds + 10 seconds = <<30+10=40>>40 seconds.\nMary's time was 40 seconds * 2 = <<40*2=80>>80 seconds.\nTiffany's time was 80 seconds - 7 seconds = <<80-7=73>>73 seconds.\nThe total time for the team was 80 seconds + 40 seconds + 30 seconds + 73 seconds = <<80+40+30+73=223>>223 seconds. The answer is 223.\n\n\nQ: Carolyn is planning out her final essay. The introduction will be 450 words, the conclusion will be triple the length of the introduction, and each of the four body sections will be the same length. If her essay has to be 5000 words total, how long is each section?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nFirst find the length of the conclusion by tripling the length of the introduction: 450 words * 3 = <<450*3=1350>>1350 words\nThen subtract the length of the introduction and conclusion from the total length to find the combined length of the body sections: 5000 words - 1350 words - 450 words = <<5000-1350-450=3200>>3200 words\nThen divide the combined length of the body section by the number of body sections to find the length of each section: 3200 words / 4 sections = <<3200/4=800>>800 words/section The answer is 800.\n\n\n"
