  "formatted_prompt": "Q: 4 friends are running a 4 x 100 relay race.  Mary ran first and took twice as long as Susan.  Susan ran second and she took 10 seconds longer than Jen.  Jen ran third and finished in 30 seconds.  Tiffany ran the last leg and finished in 7 seconds less than Mary.  How many seconds did it take the team to finish the race?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nSusan's time was 30 seconds + 10 seconds = <<30+10=40>>40 seconds.\nMary's time was 40 seconds * 2 = <<40*2=80>>80 seconds.\nTiffany's time was 80 seconds - 7 seconds = <<80-7=73>>73 seconds.\nThe total time for the team was 80 seconds + 40 seconds + 30 seconds + 73 seconds = <<80+40+30+73=223>>223 seconds. The answer is 223.\n\n\nQ: An old pirate wants to leave his treasure on an island. He has 3500 gold coins. He wants to spread this equally across 5 chests. Additionally, he will put a total of 500 silver coins and twice as many bronze coins as silver, all distributed equally across the chests. How many coins in total will be in each chest?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThere will be 3500 gold coins / 5 chest= <<3500/5=700>>700 gold coins in every chest.\nSo, there will be 500 silver coins / 5 chests = <<500/5=100>>100 silver coins in each chest.\nThen, the number of bronze coins is double the number of silver coins, so there are 2 * 500 = <<2*500=1000>>1000 bronze coins.\nSo there will be 1000 bronze coins / 5 chests = <<1000/5=200>>200 bronze coins in each chest.\nFinally, the total number of coins in every chest will be 700 gold coins + 100 silver coins + 200 bronze coins = <<700+100+200=1000>>1000 coins. The answer is 1000.\n\n\nQ: Mitzel spent 35% of her allowance. If she spent $14, how much money is left in her allowance?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nIf 35% represents 14, then 100-35 = 65 represents the amount left of her allowance.\nThe amount she didn't use is 65*14/35 = <<65*14/35=26>>26 The answer is 26.\n\n\n"
