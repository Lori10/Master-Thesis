  "formatted_prompt": "Q: There are 180 students in ninth grade. 1/4 of them bombed their finals because they were going through difficult breakups. 1/3rd of the rest didn't show up to take the test, and another 20 got less than a D. How many students passed their finals?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nFirst find the number of students who went through breakups: 1/4 * 180 = <<1/4*180=45>>45 students\nThen subtract that number from the total number: 180 students - 45 students = <<180-45=135>>135 students\nThen divide that number by 3 to find the number of students who didn't show up to take the test: 135 students / 3 = <<135/3=45>>45 students\nThen subtract the number of students who failed in each way from the total number to find the number who passed: 180 students - 45 students - 45 students - 20 students = <<180-45-45-20=70>>70 students The answer is 70.\n\n\nQ: Bart makes a mixtape.  The first side has 6 songs.  The second side has 4 songs.  Each song is 4 minutes.  How long is the total tape?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThere are 6+4=<<6+4=10>>10 songs on the tape.\nIn total, the time is 10*4=<<10*4=40>>40 minutes. The answer is 40.\n\n\n"
