  "formatted_prompt": "Q: When Jason plays the video game, Duty for Ashes, his mission to slay the dragon hoard requires that he fire his weapon on average every 15 seconds.   And each time he fires his weapon, his power-fire setting allows him to shoot a flame for 5 seconds.  On average, how many seconds per minute does Jason shoot flames at the dragon hoard?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nSince he fires his weapon on average every 15 seconds, then in one minute he fires the flamethrower 60/15=<<60/15=4>>4 times.\nAnd since each time he fires his weapon, he shoots flame for 5 seconds, then Jason shoots flames at the dragon hoard a total of 4*5=<<4*5=20>>20 seconds of every minute. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: There are 180 students in ninth grade. 1/4 of them bombed their finals because they were going through difficult breakups. 1/3rd of the rest didn't show up to take the test, and another 20 got less than a D. How many students passed their finals?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nFirst find the number of students who went through breakups: 1/4 * 180 = <<1/4*180=45>>45 students\nThen subtract that number from the total number: 180 students - 45 students = <<180-45=135>>135 students\nThen divide that number by 3 to find the number of students who didn't show up to take the test: 135 students / 3 = <<135/3=45>>45 students\nThen subtract the number of students who failed in each way from the total number to find the number who passed: 180 students - 45 students - 45 students - 20 students = <<180-45-45-20=70>>70 students The answer is 70.\n\n\n"
