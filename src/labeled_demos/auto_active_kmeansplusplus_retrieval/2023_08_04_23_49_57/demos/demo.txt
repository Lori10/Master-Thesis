Q: Stefan goes to a restaurant to eat dinner with his family. They order an appetizer that costs $10 and 4 entrees that are $20 each. If they tip 20% of the total for the waiter, what is the total amount of money that they spend at the restaurant?
 A: Let's think step by step.
The total cost of the entrees is 4 * $20 = $<<4*20=80>>80.
The total cost of the dinner is $80 + $10 = $<<80+10=90>>90.
The tip is $90 * 0.20 = $<<90*0.20=18>>18
The total cost with tip is $90 + $18 = $<<90+18=108>>108 The answer is 108.



Q: An old pirate wants to leave his treasure on an island. He has 3500 gold coins. He wants to spread this equally across 5 chests. Additionally, he will put a total of 500 silver coins and twice as many bronze coins as silver, all distributed equally across the chests. How many coins in total will be in each chest?
 A: Let's think step by step.
There will be 3500 gold coins / 5 chest= <<3500/5=700>>700 gold coins in every chest.
So, there will be 500 silver coins / 5 chests = <<500/5=100>>100 silver coins in each chest.
Then, the number of bronze coins is double the number of silver coins, so there are 2 * 500 = <<2*500=1000>>1000 bronze coins.
So there will be 1000 bronze coins / 5 chests = <<1000/5=200>>200 bronze coins in each chest.
Finally, the total number of coins in every chest will be 700 gold coins + 100 silver coins + 200 bronze coins = <<700+100+200=1000>>1000 coins. The answer is 1000.
