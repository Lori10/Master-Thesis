  "test_question": "Q: As Sally walked to school, she was holding the strings to 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. Suddenly, a gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst.  The shockingly loud sound startled Sally, and she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons.  But as she neared the school grounds, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree, and she added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons, which she carried into the school.  What number of balloons did she finally carry into the school?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Ben has 8 apples more than Phillip does. Tom has three eighths as many apples at Ben has. If Phillip has 40 apples, how many apples does Tom have?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nBen has 40+8 = <<40+8=48>>48 apples.\nThere are 48/8 = <<48/8=6>>6 apples in every eighth.\nTom has 6*3 = <<6*3=18>>18 apples. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: There have been 15 \"Where's Waldo?\" books published. Each book has 30 puzzles to find Waldo. The average person takes 3 minutes to find Waldo in a puzzle. How long would it take to find every Waldo?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThere have been 450 puzzles because 15 x 30 = <<450=450>>450\nIt would take 1,350 minutes to find all the Waldo's because 450 x 3 = <<450*3=1350>>1,350 The answer is 1350.\n\n\nQ: The gauge on a water tank shows that the tank is 1/3 full of water. To fill the tank, 16 gallons of water are added. How many gallons of water does the tank hold when full?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nGiven that the tank is 1/3 full of water, and that it requires 16 gallons to fill. 1 full tank -1/3 tank = 2/3 of the tank is empty, which is equal to 16 gallons.\nIf 2/3 of the tank equals 16 gallons, this means 1/3 of the tank is equal to 16 / 2 gallons = 8 gallons\nThe total capacity of the tank or how much the tanks holds = 16 + 8 = <<16+8=24>>24 gallons The answer is 24.\n\n\n"
