  "test_question": "Q: To kick off summer, Jolene is having a water balloon fight with her friends.  They fill up 10 packs of balloons that have 30 balloons per pack.  By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons are left.  How many balloons did they throw?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Ben has 8 apples more than Phillip does. Tom has three eighths as many apples at Ben has. If Phillip has 40 apples, how many apples does Tom have?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nBen has 40+8 = <<40+8=48>>48 apples.\nThere are 48/8 = <<48/8=6>>6 apples in every eighth.\nTom has 6*3 = <<6*3=18>>18 apples. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: There have been 15 \"Where's Waldo?\" books published. Each book has 30 puzzles to find Waldo. The average person takes 3 minutes to find Waldo in a puzzle. How long would it take to find every Waldo?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThere have been 450 puzzles because 15 x 30 = <<450=450>>450\nIt would take 1,350 minutes to find all the Waldo's because 450 x 3 = <<450*3=1350>>1,350 The answer is 1350.\n\n\nQ: The gauge on a water tank shows that the tank is 1/3 full of water. To fill the tank, 16 gallons of water are added. How many gallons of water does the tank hold when full?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nGiven that the tank is 1/3 full of water, and that it requires 16 gallons to fill. 1 full tank -1/3 tank = 2/3 of the tank is empty, which is equal to 16 gallons.\nIf 2/3 of the tank equals 16 gallons, this means 1/3 of the tank is equal to 16 / 2 gallons = 8 gallons\nThe total capacity of the tank or how much the tanks holds = 16 + 8 = <<16+8=24>>24 gallons The answer is 24.\n\n\n"
