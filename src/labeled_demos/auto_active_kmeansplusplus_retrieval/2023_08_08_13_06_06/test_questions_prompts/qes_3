  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Ben has 8 apples more than Phillip does. Tom has three eighths as many apples at Ben has. If Phillip has 40 apples, how many apples does Tom have?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nBen has 40+8 = <<40+8=48>>48 apples.\nThere are 48/8 = <<48/8=6>>6 apples in every eighth.\nTom has 6*3 = <<6*3=18>>18 apples. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: A portable battery charger can fully charge a smartphone in 26 minutes or a tablet in 53 minutes. Ana charged her tablet fully and her phone halfway. How many minutes did it take?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nAna charged her phone halfway, so she took 26 / 2 = <<26/2=13>>13 minutes to charge her phone.\nThus, it took Ana 13 + 53 = <<13+53=66>>66 minutes to charge her phone and tablet. The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: The gauge on a water tank shows that the tank is 1/3 full of water. To fill the tank, 16 gallons of water are added. How many gallons of water does the tank hold when full?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nGiven that the tank is 1/3 full of water, and that it requires 16 gallons to fill. 1 full tank -1/3 tank = 2/3 of the tank is empty, which is equal to 16 gallons.\nIf 2/3 of the tank equals 16 gallons, this means 1/3 of the tank is equal to 16 / 2 gallons = 8 gallons\nThe total capacity of the tank or how much the tanks holds = 16 + 8 = <<16+8=24>>24 gallons The answer is 24.\n\n\n"
