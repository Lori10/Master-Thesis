Explanation : (a + b)2 + (a \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 b)2 = 2(a2 + b2) (Reference : Basic Algebraic Formulas) 1082 + 922 = (100 + 8)2 + (100 \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 8)2 = 2(1002 + 82) = 2(10000 + 64) = 20128. Answer : Option C The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: (ab)x\u22122=(ba)x\u22127. What is the value of x ? Answer Choices: (A) 1.5 (B) 4.5 (C) 7.5 (D) 9.5 (E) 8.7\nA: Let's think step by step. Explanation: (a/b)x\u22122=(b/a)x\u22127\u21d2(a/b)x\u22122=(a/b)\u2212(x\u22127)\u21d2x\u22122=\u2212(x\u22127)\u21d2x\u22122=\u2212x+7\u21d2x\u22122=\u2212x+7\u21d22x=9\u21d2x=92=4.5 Option B The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In a certain country \u00bd of 5 = 3.
