The waste pipe can empty the full cistern in? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 6 (C) 7 (D) 9 (E) 1\nA: Let's think step by step. 1/10 + 1/15 - 1/x = 1/18 x = 9 Answer: D The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Three friends-whose walking rates are 1 ft./sec., 3ft./sec.,and 6ft./sec. start together walking in the same direction around a circular track that is 420 feet in circumference.After how many minutes are the three of them together again? Answer Choices: (A) 5 mins (B) 10 mins (C) 15 mins (D) 3 mins (E) 7 mins\nA: Let's think step by step.
