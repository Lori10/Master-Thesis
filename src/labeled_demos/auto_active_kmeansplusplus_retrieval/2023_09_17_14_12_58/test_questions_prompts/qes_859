  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Emery's family decides to travel for a weekend trip. They drive the first 100 miles in 1 hour. They stop at a McDonald's and then continue the rest of the journey for 300 miles. What's the total number of hours they traveled?\nA: Let's think step by step. If the first 100 miles took one hour, then let's say the next 300 miles took x hours. if 100 miles = 1 hour, then 300 miles =x. To find the number of hours traveled for the 300 miles, x = 300*1/100 x= <<3=3>>3 hours. The total number of hours will be 3 +1 = <<3+1=4>>4 hours The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Timmy, Tommy and Tina are filling up a kiddie pool in their backyard.  Each has a pail they fill with water from a house before dumping it into the pool.  If Timmy's pail holds twice as much water as Tommy's, and Tommy's holds 2 gallons more than Tina's, and Tina's is 4 gallons, how much water do the three of them fill the pool with after 3 trips each?\nA: Let's think step by step. If Tina's pail holds 4 gallons and Tommy's holds 2 more gallons than hers, that means Tommy's holds 4+2=<<4+2=6>>6 gallons. If Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's 6-gallon pail, that means it holds 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 gallons. Therefore, in 1 trip that means all three move a total of 4+6+12=<<4+6+12=22>>22 gallons. In three trips, that means they would move a total of 22*3=<<22*3=66>>66 gallons The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: A big snowstorm caused a large amount of snow to fall onto Grandpa's farm, and the wind caused the snow to pile up into a drift.  But on the second day, it warmed up enough that half of the snowdrift melted.  The third day, it snowed again, adding another 6 inches of snow onto the snowdrift.  On the fourth day, another 18 inches of snow fell onto the snowdrift.  If the snowdrift was 34 inches deep at the end of the fourth day, how deep in inches was the drift at the end of the first day?\nA: Let's think step by step. The third and fourth day contributed 6+18=<<6+18=24>>24 inches to the depth of the snowdrift. Therefore, the size of the snowdrift after half was melted on the second day, but before the snowfall on the third and fourth day, was 34-24=<<34-24=10>>10 inches. If the size of the drift on the second day, after half of the snow had melted, was 10 inches, then the depth of the original drift created on day 1 was 2*10=20 inches deep. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Hank reads the newspaper every morning, 5 days a week for 30 minutes.  He reads part of a novel every evening, 5 days a week, for 1 hour.  He doubles his reading time on Saturday and Sundays.  How many minutes does Hank spend reading in 1 week?\nA: Let's think step by step. He reads 30 minutes in the morning 5 days a week for a total of 30*5 = <<30*5=150>>150 minutes He doubles his reading time on the weekends so 30*2 = <<30*2=60>>60 minutes per day He reads 60 minutes on Saturday and Sunday in the mornings for a total of 60+60 = <<60+60=120>>120 minutes He reads 1 hour in the evenings 5 days a week for a total of 1*5 = <<1*5=5>>5 hours He doubles his reading time on the weekends so 1*2 = <<1*2=2>>2 hours per day He reads 2 hours on Saturday and Sunday in the evenings for a total of 2+2 = <<2+2=4>>4 hours He read 5+4 = 9 hours which, when converted to minutes is 9*60 = 540 minutes He reads 150 minutes in the morning and 120 minutes in the evenings and 540 over the weekend for a total of 150+120+540 = 810 minutes in 1 week The answer is 810.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First subtract the 7 double-counted animals from Mary's total: 60 animals - 7 animals = <<60-7=53>>53 animals Then add the animals she missed to find the real total: 53 animals + 3 pigs = <<53+3=56>>56 animals The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: An apple tree has three times as many apples as the number of plums on a plum tree. If Damien picks 3/5 of the fruits from the trees, calculate the total number of plums and apples remaining on the tree if there were 180 apples on the apple tree before Damien picked any of the fruits.\nA: Let's think step by step. Initially, the were 180//3= <<180//3=60>>60 plums on the plum tree. When Damien picked 3/5 of the apples from the apple tree, he picked 3/5*180 = <<3/5*180=108>>108 apples The number of apples remaining on the apple tree is 180-108= <<180-108=72>>72 The number of plums that Damien picked from the plum tree is 3/5*60 = <<3/5*60=36>>36 The number of plums remaining on the plum tree is 60-36 = <<60-36=24>>24 The total number of fruits remaining on the trees is 72 apples+24 plums = <<72+24=96>>96 The answer is 96.\n\n\nQ: At the duck park, there are 25 mallard ducks and ten less than twice as many geese as ducks.  Then, a small flock of 4 ducks arrived at the park and joined the birds already there.  If five less than 15 geese leave the park, how many more geese than ducks remain at the park?\nA: Let's think step by step. Initially, twice as many geese as ducks is 25*2=<<25*2=50>>50 geese. Therefore, ten less than twice as many geese as ducks is 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 geese. Then, 4 ducks arrived at the park, resulting in 25+4=<<4+25=29>>29 ducks. Five less than 15 geese is 15-5=<<15-5=10>>10 geese. Thus, if 5 less than 15 geese leave, then 40-10=30 geese remain. Thus, there are 30-29=<<30-29=1>>1 more geese than ducks remaining at the park. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Bea's mom planted 50 Mahogany and 30 Narra trees on their farm. Due to a typhoon, a total of 5 trees fell. One more Mahogany tree fell than the number of Narra trees that fell. A month after the typhoon, Bea's mom planted twice as much as the number of the Narra and thrice the number of Mahogany trees that fell. How many trees are now on the farm?\nA: Let's think step by step. Before the typhoon, their farm had a total of 50 trees + 30 trees = <<50+30=80>>80 trees. If there was 1 more than Mahogany than Narra tree that fell, then this means there were 2 Narra trees and 2 + 1 = 3 Mahogany trees that fell during the typhoon. So, Bea's mom planted 2 trees x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 Narra trees. She also planted 3 trees x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 Mahogany trees. So, her mom planted 4 trees + 9 trees = <<4+9=13>>13 more trees. After the typhoon, they only had 80 trees - 5 trees = <<80-5=75>>75 trees left. Therefore, there are 75 trees + 13 trees = <<75+13=88>>88 trees now. The answer is 88.\n\n\n"
