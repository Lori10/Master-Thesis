  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Bertha wears out 20 / 10 = <<20/10=2>>2 tennis balls in 20 games. She loses 20 / 5 = <<20/5=4>>4 tennis balls in 20 games. She buys canisters of 3 * 20 / 4 = <<3*20/4=15>>15 tennis balls in 20 games. Bertha started with 2 balls and gave 1 away, so she has 2 + 15 - 2 - 4 - 1 = <<2+15-2-4-1=10>>10 tennis balls after twenty games. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First subtract the 7 double-counted animals from Mary's total: 60 animals - 7 animals = <<60-7=53>>53 animals Then add the animals she missed to find the real total: 53 animals + 3 pigs = <<53+3=56>>56 animals The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Jill makes scented candles as a hobby. Her favorite scents are lavender, coconut, and almond, and she uses the same amount of each scent for every candle. This time, she made twice as many lavender candles as coconut candles, along with a batch of almond candles. She ran out of almond scent after making ten candles. If she had one and a half times as much coconut scent as almond scent and used all her coconut scent up too, how many lavender candles did she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. Jill made one and a half times as many coconut candles as almond candles, so she made 10 * 1 1/2 = 15 coconut candles. She made twice as many lavender candles as coconut candles, so she made 2 * 15 = <<2*15=30>>30 lavender candles. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: Michael has two brothers. His oldest brother is 1 year older than twice Michael's age when Michael was a year younger. His younger brother is 5 years old, which is a third of the age of the older brother. What is their combined age?\nA: Let's think step by step. The oldest brother is 15 because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 Michael is 8 because if 1 + (Michael's age - 1) x 2 = 15 then Michael's age = 8 Their combined age is 28 because 5 + 15 + 8 = <<5+15+8=28>>28 The answer is 28.\n\n\nQ: Alyssa took 100 photos on vacation. She wants to put them in a photo album with 30 pages. She can place 3 photos each on the first 10 pages. Then she can place 4 photos each on the next 10 pages. If she wants to put an equal number of photos on each of the remaining pages of the album, how many photos can she place on each page?\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 3 x 10 = <<3*10=30>>30 photos in total that can be placed in the first 10 pages. There are 4 x 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 photos in total that can be placed in the next 10 pages. A total of 10 + 10 = <<10+10=20>>20 pages of the album have been used. A total of 30 + 40 = <<30+40=70>>70 photos can be placed on those 20 pages. So there are still 100 - 70 = <<100-70=30>>30 photos left to be placed on the album. And there are 30 - 20 = <<30-20=10>>10 pages left in the album. Therefore, 30/10 = <<30/10=3>>3 photos can be placed on each of the pages. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Selina is selling some of her old clothes to a second-hand store. They will buy her pants for $5 each, her shorts for $3 each, and her shirts for $4 each. She sells 3 pairs of pants, 5 pairs of shorts, and some shirts.

The shirts she bought cost her $20 because 2 x 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 She earned $50 selling her clothes because 20 + 30 = <<20+30=50>>50 She made $15 off pants because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 She made 15 dollars from shorts because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 She made $20 off shirts because 50 - 15 - 15 = <<50-15-15=20>>20 She sold 5 shirts because 20 / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. 20% of her 40 students will bring their own life vest so .20*40 = <<.20*40=8>>8 students will bring their life vests Alice has 20 life vests and 8 students will bring there's so that's 20+8 = <<20+8=28>>28 life vests There are 40 students and 10 instructors total so that's 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 people in the class If there are 28 life vests and she has 50 people then she needs to find 50-28 = 22 more life vests The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Bea's mom planted 50 Mahogany and 30 Narra trees on their farm. Due to a typhoon, a total of 5 trees fell. One more Mahogany tree fell than the number of Narra trees that fell. A month after the typhoon, Bea's mom planted twice as much as the number of the Narra and thrice the number of Mahogany trees that fell. How many trees are now on the farm?\nA: Let's think step by step. Before the typhoon, their farm had a total of 50 trees + 30 trees = <<50+30=80>>80 trees. If there was 1 more than Mahogany than Narra tree that fell, then this means there were 2 Narra trees and 2 + 1 = 3 Mahogany trees that fell during the typhoon. So, Bea's mom planted 2 trees x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 Narra trees. She also planted 3 trees x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 Mahogany trees. So, her mom planted 4 trees + 9 trees = <<4+9=13>>13 more trees. After the typhoon, they only had 80 trees - 5 trees = <<80-5=75>>75 trees left. Therefore, there are 75 trees + 13 trees = <<75+13=88>>88 trees now. The answer is 88.\n\n\n"
