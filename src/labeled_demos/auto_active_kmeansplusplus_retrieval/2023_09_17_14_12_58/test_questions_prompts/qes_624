  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Alexander draws 9 pictures for an exhibition at a gallery. 5 new galleries also want Alexander to draw for them, so he draws pictures for their exhibitions too. Each of these new galleries receives the same amount of pictures. For each picture, Alexander needs 4 pencils. For each exhibition, he needs another 2 pencils for signing his signature on the pictures. If Alexander uses 88 pencils on drawing and signing his pictures for all of the exhibitions, how many paintings are at each of the 5 new galleries?\nA: Let's think step by step. Alexander has sent pictures to a total of 1 original gallery + 5 new galleries = <<1+5=6>>6 galleries. For signatures, he has used a total of 6 galleries * 2 pencils per gallery = <<6*2=12>>12 pencils. So of the pencils that he used, 88 total pencils \u2013 12 signature pencils = <<88-12=76>>76 pencils for drawings. At the first gallery, he used 9 pictures * 4 pencils per picture = <<9*4=36>>36 pencils. So in the new galleries, he used 76 total pencils for drawings \u2013 36 pencils at the first gallery = <<76-36=40>>40 pencils. The new galleries received a total of 40 pencils / 4 pencils per picture = <<40/4=10>>10 pictures. As the new galleries all receive equal amounts of pictures, each gallery must have 10 pictures / 5 galleries = <<10/5=2>>2 pictures per gallery. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Mark is running for an election and wins 70% of the votes in an area with 100,000 voters.  He got twice as many total votes in the remaining area.  How many votes did he get in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. He got 100,000*.7=<<100000*.7=70000>>70,000 votes from the first area He got 70,000*2=<<70000*2=140000>>140,000 votes in the remaining areas So in total he got 140,000+70,000=<<140000+70000=210000>>210,000 votes The answer is 210000.\n\n\nQ: Logan makes $65,000 a year. He spends $20,000 on rent every year, $5000 on groceries every year, and $8000 on gas every year. If he wants to have at least $42000 left, how much more money must he make each year?\nA: Let's think step by step. Logan spends 20000+5000+8000 = <<20000+5000+8000=33000>>33000 a year. Logan has 65000-33000 = <<65000-33000=32000>>32000 left a year. Logan needs to make 42000-32000 = <<42000-32000=10000>>10000 more a year. The answer is 10000.\n\n\nQ: Steve has a bank account that earns 10% interest every year. He puts $100 in it, and then 10 each year. How much money is in it after two years?\nA: Let's think step by step. After one year it earns $10 in interest because 100 x .1 = <<100*.1=10>>10 It has $120 in it after a year because 100 + 10 + 10 = <<100+10+10=120>>120 In the second year it earns $12 in interest because 120 x .1 = <<120*.1=12>>12 In the second year it has $142 in it because 120 + 12 + 10 = <<120+12+10=142>>142 The answer is 142.\n\n\nQ: Hazel put up a lemonade stand. She sold half her lemonade to a construction crew. She sold 18 cups to kids on bikes. She gave away half that amount to her friends. Then she drank the last cup of lemonade herself. How many cups of lemonade did Hazel make?\nA: Let's think step by step. Hazel sold 18 cups of lemonade to kids on bikes and gave half that amount, or 18 / 2 = <<18/2=9>>9 cups, away to friends. Hazel sold 18 cups + gave away 9 cups + drank 1 cup = <<18+9+1=28>>28 cups. Since Hazel sold half her lemonade to a construction crew, that means the 28 cups she sold to kids on bikes, gave away to friends and drank herself are the other half, so she sold 28 cups to the construction crew. In all, Hazel sold 28 + 28 = <<28+28=56>>56 cups of lemonade. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Alyssa took 100 photos on vacation. She wants to put them in a photo album with 30 pages. She can place 3 photos each on the first 10 pages. Then she can place 4 photos each on the next 10 pages. If she wants to put an equal number of photos on each of the remaining pages of the album, how many photos can she place on each page?\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 3 x 10 = <<3*10=30>>30 photos in total that can be placed in the first 10 pages. There are 4 x 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 photos in total that can be placed in the next 10 pages. A total of 10 + 10 = <<10+10=20>>20 pages of the album have been used. A total of 30 + 40 = <<30+40=70>>70 photos can be placed on those 20 pages. So there are still 100 - 70 = <<100-70=30>>30 photos left to be placed on the album. And there are 30 - 20 = <<30-20=10>>10 pages left in the album. Therefore, 30/10 = <<30/10=3>>3 photos can be placed on each of the pages. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First subtract the 7 double-counted animals from Mary's total: 60 animals - 7 animals = <<60-7=53>>53 animals Then add the animals she missed to find the real total: 53 animals + 3 pigs = <<53+3=56>>56 animals The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Michael has two brothers. His oldest brother is 1 year older than twice Michael's age when Michael was a year younger. His younger brother is 5 years old, which is a third of the age of the older brother. What is their combined age?\nA: Let's think step by step. The oldest brother is 15 because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 Michael is 8 because if 1 + (Michael's age - 1) x 2 = 15 then Michael's age = 8 Their combined age is 28 because 5 + 15 + 8 = <<5+15+8=28>>28 The answer is 28.\n\n\n"
