  "test_question": "Q: Four dogs sat in a line within the veterinarian's waiting room.  The first dog was the Affenpinscher, who weighed only 10 pounds.  Next to him sat a Dachshund, who weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher.  Next to the Dachshund sat a Papillon, who weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund.  And at the end of the line sat a Mastiff, who weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon.  How much did the Mastiff weigh, in pounds?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: John adopts a dog from a shelter.  The dog ends up having health problems and this requires 3 vet appointments,  which cost $400 each.  After the first appointment, John paid $100 for pet insurance that covers 80% of the subsequent visits.  How much did he pay in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. He got a discount of 400*.8=$<<400*.8=320>>320 He got that discount for 3-1=<<3-1=2>>2 visits So each of those visits cost 400-320=$<<400-320=80>>80 So he paid 2*80=$<<2*80=160>>160 for those visits That means he paid a total of 400+160+100=$<<400+160+100=660>>660 The answer is 660.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First subtract the 7 double-counted animals from Mary's total: 60 animals - 7 animals = <<60-7=53>>53 animals Then add the animals she missed to find the real total: 53 animals + 3 pigs = <<53+3=56>>56 animals The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Carlos and Diego are racing around the block. Carlos runs around the entire block in 3 minutes. Diego runs around half the block in 2.5 minutes and then is tripped by a dog and can't finish. Assuming he kept up the same speed the entire race, what would've been the average time in seconds for the racers?\nA: Let's think step by step. If he finished the race, it would've taken 5 minutes because 2.5 x 2 = <<2.5*2=5>>5 Their total time would've been 8 minutes because 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 The average would've been 4 minutes because 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 The average time in seconds would've been 240 because 4 x 60 = <<4*60=240>>240 The answer is 240.\n\n\nQ: A big snowstorm caused a large amount of snow to fall onto Grandpa's farm, and the wind caused the snow to pile up into a drift.  But on the second day, it warmed up enough that half of the snowdrift melted.  The third day, it snowed again, adding another 6 inches of snow onto the snowdrift.  On the fourth day, another 18 inches of snow fell onto the snowdrift.  If the snowdrift was 34 inches deep at the end of the fourth day, how deep in inches was the drift at the end of the first day?\nA: Let's think step by step. The third and fourth day contributed 6+18=<<6+18=24>>24 inches to the depth of the snowdrift. Therefore, the size of the snowdrift after half was melted on the second day, but before the snowfall on the third and fourth day, was 34-24=<<34-24=10>>10 inches. If the size of the drift on the second day, after half of the snow had melted, was 10 inches, then the depth of the original drift created on day 1 was 2*10=20 inches deep. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Seven parrots and some crows are perched on a tree branch. There was a noise and the same number of parrots and crows flew away. If only 2 parrots and 1 crow are left on the tree branch now, how many birds were perched on the branch to begin with?\nA: Let's think step by step. The number of parrots that flew away after the noise is 7-2 = <<7-2=5>>5 The same number of crows (5) flew away leaving 1 crow so there were 5+1 = <<5+1=6>>6 crows to begin with The total number of crows and parrots was 7+6 = <<7+6=13>>13 The answer is 13.\n\n\nQ: Aimee does a poll around her neighborhood and makes sure to get answers from 50% men and 50% women. She finds that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. How many people did she poll?\nA: Let's think step by step. 65% of women are opposed to the idea because 100 - 35 = <<100-35=65>>65 There are 60 women in the poll because 39 / .65 = <<39/.65=60>>60 There were 120 people in her poll because 60 / .5 = <<60/.5=120>>120 The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: At the duck park, there are 25 mallard ducks and ten less than twice as many geese as ducks.  Then, a small flock of 4 ducks arrived at the park and joined the birds already there.  If five less than 15 geese leave the park, how many more geese than ducks remain at the park?\nA: Let's think step by step. Initially, twice as many geese as ducks is 25*2=<<25*2=50>>50 geese. Therefore, ten less than twice as many geese as ducks is 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 geese. Then, 4 ducks arrived at the park, resulting in 25+4=<<4+25=29>>29 ducks. Five less than 15 geese is 15-5=<<15-5=10>>10 geese. Thus, if 5 less than 15 geese leave, then 40-10=30 geese remain. Thus, there are 30-29=<<30-29=1>>1 more geese than ducks remaining at the park. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Phoebe has two pizzas to share with her and three friends. One has pepperoni and the other has cheese. They both have 16 slices. They all eat the same amount. One friend eats only pepperoni, while the rest have an equal number of slices of each. At the end, there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese, how many slices does each person eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. They are 9 slices of cheese because 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 They ate three slices of cheese each because 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3 They are 6 slices each in total because 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 The answer is 6.\n\n\n"
