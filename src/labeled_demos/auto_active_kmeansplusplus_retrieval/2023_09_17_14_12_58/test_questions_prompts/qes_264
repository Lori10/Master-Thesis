  "test_question": "Q: Tim wanted to make lemonade for a pool party.  For a gallon of lemonade, his recipe called for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.  He found that 6 lemons would yield 1 cup of juice.  He figured he would need to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.  His best friend Allen asked if Tim could make an extra gallon for him that was twice as tart as the other gallons.  How many lemons will Tim need?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Hazel put up a lemonade stand. She sold half her lemonade to a construction crew. She sold 18 cups to kids on bikes. She gave away half that amount to her friends. Then she drank the last cup of lemonade herself. How many cups of lemonade did Hazel make?\nA: Let's think step by step. Hazel sold 18 cups of lemonade to kids on bikes and gave half that amount, or 18 / 2 = <<18/2=9>>9 cups, away to friends. Hazel sold 18 cups + gave away 9 cups + drank 1 cup = <<18+9+1=28>>28 cups. Since Hazel sold half her lemonade to a construction crew, that means the 28 cups she sold to kids on bikes, gave away to friends and drank herself are the other half, so she sold 28 cups to the construction crew. In all, Hazel sold 28 + 28 = <<28+28=56>>56 cups of lemonade. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Timmy, Tommy and Tina are filling up a kiddie pool in their backyard.  Each has a pail they fill with water from a house before dumping it into the pool.  If Timmy's pail holds twice as much water as Tommy's, and Tommy's holds 2 gallons more than Tina's, and Tina's is 4 gallons, how much water do the three of them fill the pool with after 3 trips each?\nA: Let's think step by step. If Tina's pail holds 4 gallons and Tommy's holds 2 more gallons than hers, that means Tommy's holds 4+2=<<4+2=6>>6 gallons. If Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's 6-gallon pail, that means it holds 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 gallons. Therefore, in 1 trip that means all three move a total of 4+6+12=<<4+6+12=22>>22 gallons. In three trips, that means they would move a total of 22*3=<<22*3=66>>66 gallons The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: Tim drinks 2 bottles that are each 1.5 quarts and an additional 20 ounces a day.  How much water does he drink a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. The bottles are 1.5*32=<<1.5*32=48>>48 ounces So he drinks 48*2=<<48*2=96>>96 ounces from the bottles So in total he drank 96+20=<<96+20=116>>116 ounces a day 116*7=<<116*7=812>>812 ounces a week The answer is 812.\n\n\nQ: Jill makes scented candles as a hobby. Her favorite scents are lavender, coconut, and almond, and she uses the same amount of each scent for every candle. This time, she made twice as many lavender candles as coconut candles, along with a batch of almond candles. She ran out of almond scent after making ten candles. If she had one and a half times as much coconut scent as almond scent and used all her coconut scent up too, how many lavender candles did she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. Jill made one and a half times as many coconut candles as almond candles, so she made 10 * 1 1/2 = 15 coconut candles. She made twice as many lavender candles as coconut candles, so she made 2 * 15 = <<2*15=30>>30 lavender candles. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: John drinks 2 energy drinks. 1 of them is a 12-ounce drink with 250 grams of caffeine.  The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce but only 2 ounces.  He then takes a caffeine pill that has as much caffeine as his 2 drinks combined.  How much caffeine did he consume?\nA: Let's think step by step. The second drink was 2/12=1/6 the size of the first drink So it had 1/6*3=1/2 the caffeine That means it had 1/2*250=<<250/2=125>>125 grams of caffeine So the total amount of caffeine he drank was 125+250=<<125+250=375>>375 grams So he consumed 375*2=<<375*2=750>>750 grams of caffeine for the day The answer is 750.\n\n\nQ: James wants to build a ladder to climb a very tall tree.  Each rung of the ladder is 18 inches long and they are 6 inches apart.  If he needs to climb 50 feet how many feet of wood will he need for the rungs?\nA: Let's think step by step. He needs 12/6=<<12/6=2>>2 rungs per foot So he needs 50*2=<<50*2=100>>100 rungs Each rung is 18/12=<<18/12=1.5>>1.5 feet So he needs 1.5*100=<<1.5*100=150>>150 feet The answer is 150.\n\n\nQ: Phoebe has two pizzas to share with her and three friends. One has pepperoni and the other has cheese. They both have 16 slices. They all eat the same amount. One friend eats only pepperoni, while the rest have an equal number of slices of each. At the end, there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese, how many slices does each person eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. They are 9 slices of cheese because 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 They ate three slices of cheese each because 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3 They are 6 slices each in total because 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. 20% of her 40 students will bring their own life vest so .20*40 = <<.20*40=8>>8 students will bring their life vests Alice has 20 life vests and 8 students will bring there's so that's 20+8 = <<20+8=28>>28 life vests There are 40 students and 10 instructors total so that's 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 people in the class If there are 28 life vests and she has 50 people then she needs to find 50-28 = 22 more life vests The answer is 22.\n\n\n"
