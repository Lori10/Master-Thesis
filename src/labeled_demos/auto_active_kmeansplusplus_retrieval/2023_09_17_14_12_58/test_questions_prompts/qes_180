  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Harrison Elementary School is overcrowded with 1590 students, so 40% of the students are going to move to a new school. There are 3 grade levels, and each grade level needs one 20-person advanced class and the rest of the students divided evenly into 6 additional classes. How many students will there be in each normal class at the new school?\nA: Let's think step by step. First find how many students go to the new school: 1590 students * .4 = <<1590*.4=636>>636 students Then divide that number by 3 to find how many students are at each grade level: 636 students / 3 grades = <<636/3=212>>212 students/grade Then subtract the 20 students in the gifted class: 212 students - 20 students = <<212-20=192>>192 students Then divide that number by 6 to find the number of students in each other class: 192 students / 6 classes = <<192/6=32>>32 students/class The answer is 32.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. 20% of her 40 students will bring their own life vest so .20*40 = <<.20*40=8>>8 students will bring their life vests Alice has 20 life vests and 8 students will bring there's so that's 20+8 = <<20+8=28>>28 life vests There are 40 students and 10 instructors total so that's 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 people in the class If there are 28 life vests and she has 50 people then she needs to find 50-28 = 22 more life vests The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Alexander draws 9 pictures for an exhibition at a gallery. 5 new galleries also want Alexander to draw for them, so he draws pictures for their exhibitions too. Each of these new galleries receives the same amount of pictures. For each picture, Alexander needs 4 pencils. For each exhibition, he needs another 2 pencils for signing his signature on the pictures. If Alexander uses 88 pencils on drawing and signing his pictures for all of the exhibitions, how many paintings are at each of the 5 new galleries?\nA: Let's think step by step. Alexander has sent pictures to a total of 1 original gallery + 5 new galleries = <<1+5=6>>6 galleries. For signatures, he has used a total of 6 galleries * 2 pencils per gallery = <<6*2=12>>12 pencils. So of the pencils that he used, 88 total pencils \u2013 12 signature pencils = <<88-12=76>>76 pencils for drawings. At the first gallery, he used 9 pictures * 4 pencils per picture = <<9*4=36>>36 pencils. So in the new galleries, he used 76 total pencils for drawings \u2013 36 pencils at the first gallery = <<76-36=40>>40 pencils. The new galleries received a total of 40 pencils / 4 pencils per picture = <<40/4=10>>10 pictures. As the new galleries all receive equal amounts of pictures, each gallery must have 10 pictures / 5 galleries = <<10/5=2>>2 pictures per gallery. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Dorothy is 15 years old and wants to go to a museum with her family. Her family consists of her, her younger brother, her parents, and her grandfather. The regular ticket cost is $10. People 18 years old or younger have a discount of 30%. How much money will Dorothy have after this trip, when she currently has $70?\nA: Let's think step by step. The discount per one ticket is 10 * 30/100 = $<<10*30/100=3>>3. So Dorothy's and her brother's tickets are cheaper by 2 * 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6. Her family consists of 5 people, so the ticket cost stands at 5 * 10 = $<<5*10=50>>50. Including the discount will lower the price to 50 - 6 = $<<50-6=44>>44 in total. Dorothy will be left with 70 - 44 = $<<70-44=26>>26. The answer is 26.\n\n\nQ: Logan makes $65,000 a year. He spends $20,000 on rent every year, $5000 on groceries every year, and $8000 on gas every year. If he wants to have at least $42000 left, how much more money must he make each year?\nA: Let's think step by step. Logan spends 20000+5000+8000 = <<20000+5000+8000=33000>>33000 a year. Logan has 65000-33000 = <<65000-33000=32000>>32000 left a year. Logan needs to make 42000-32000 = <<42000-32000=10000>>10000 more a year. The answer is 10000.\n\n\nQ: Ryan works in an office that has an even number of men and women working there.  Ryan participates in a meeting composed of 4 men and 6 women who are pulled from the office floor.   This reduces the number of women working on the office floor by 20%.  How many people work at Ryan's office?\nA: Let's think step by step. Since 6 women are 20% of the total number of women working there, that means there are 6*5= <<6*5=30>>30 women working there in total. Since there are an even number of women and men working in the office, that means there are 30*2= <<30*2=60>>60 people working there in total, since there are 2 sexes. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Mark is running for an election and wins 70% of the votes in an area with 100,000 voters.  He got twice as many total votes in the remaining area.  How many votes did he get in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. He got 100,000*.7=<<100000*.7=70000>>70,000 votes from the first area He got 70,000*2=<<70000*2=140000>>140,000 votes in the remaining areas So in total he got 140,000+70,000=<<140000+70000=210000>>210,000 votes The answer is 210000.\n\n\nQ: Aimee does a poll around her neighborhood and makes sure to get answers from 50% men and 50% women. She finds that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. How many people did she poll?\nA: Let's think step by step. 65% of women are opposed to the idea because 100 - 35 = <<100-35=65>>65 There are 60 women in the poll because 39 / .65 = <<39/.65=60>>60 There were 120 people in her poll because 60 / .5 = <<60/.5=120>>120 The answer is 120.\n\n\n"
