  "test_question": "Q: Mack wants to count things and decided to count how many birds there are in the sky over the next week. On days one and two, Mack saw a total of 50 birds. On day three he saw none. On days four and five, he saw 120 birds. On day six he saw 20 and on day seven he saw 90. On average, how many birds did Mack see in a day?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Seven parrots and some crows are perched on a tree branch. There was a noise and the same number of parrots and crows flew away. If only 2 parrots and 1 crow are left on the tree branch now, how many birds were perched on the branch to begin with?\nA: Let's think step by step. The number of parrots that flew away after the noise is 7-2 = <<7-2=5>>5 The same number of crows (5) flew away leaving 1 crow so there were 5+1 = <<5+1=6>>6 crows to begin with The total number of crows and parrots was 7+6 = <<7+6=13>>13 The answer is 13.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First subtract the 7 double-counted animals from Mary's total: 60 animals - 7 animals = <<60-7=53>>53 animals Then add the animals she missed to find the real total: 53 animals + 3 pigs = <<53+3=56>>56 animals The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: At the duck park, there are 25 mallard ducks and ten less than twice as many geese as ducks.  Then, a small flock of 4 ducks arrived at the park and joined the birds already there.  If five less than 15 geese leave the park, how many more geese than ducks remain at the park?\nA: Let's think step by step. Initially, twice as many geese as ducks is 25*2=<<25*2=50>>50 geese. Therefore, ten less than twice as many geese as ducks is 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 geese. Then, 4 ducks arrived at the park, resulting in 25+4=<<4+25=29>>29 ducks. Five less than 15 geese is 15-5=<<15-5=10>>10 geese. Thus, if 5 less than 15 geese leave, then 40-10=30 geese remain. Thus, there are 30-29=<<30-29=1>>1 more geese than ducks remaining at the park. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Mr. McNeely takes a register of the total number of students present in class every day. On a particular week, the number of students in the class on the second day was 40 more than the first day. The number of students who didn't turn up for the class on the second day was twice the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day. On the third day, 1/7 of the total number of students of the class called in sick. If the total number of students in the class is 280, calculate the number of absent students in the three days.\nA: Let's think step by step. On the third day, 1/7*280 = <<1/7*280=40>>40 students called in sick. If the number of students absent on the second day was twice the number on the third day, then 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80 students didn't show up for the class on the second day. The total number of students present in the class on the second day was 280-80= <<280-80=200>>200. If 40 fewer students showed up for the class on the first day than on the second day, then 200-40 = <<200-40=160>>160 students showed up for the class on the first day. The number of students absent on the first day is 280-160 = <<280-160=120>>120 In the three days, the total number of absentees is 120+80+40 = <<120+80+40=240>>240 The answer is 240.\n\n\nQ: Hank reads the newspaper every morning, 5 days a week for 30 minutes.  He reads part of a novel every evening, 5 days a week, for 1 hour.  He doubles his reading time on Saturday and Sundays.  How many minutes does Hank spend reading in 1 week?\nA: Let's think step by step. He reads 30 minutes in the morning 5 days a week for a total of 30*5 = <<30*5=150>>150 minutes He doubles his reading time on the weekends so 30*2 = <<30*2=60>>60 minutes per day He reads 60 minutes on Saturday and Sunday in the mornings for a total of 60+60 = <<60+60=120>>120 minutes He reads 1 hour in the evenings 5 days a week for a total of 1*5 = <<1*5=5>>5 hours He doubles his reading time on the weekends so 1*2 = <<1*2=2>>2 hours per day He reads 2 hours on Saturday and Sunday in the evenings for a total of 2+2 = <<2+2=4>>4 hours He read 5+4 = 9 hours which, when converted to minutes is 9*60 = 540 minutes He reads 150 minutes in the morning and 120 minutes in the evenings and 540 over the weekend for a total of 150+120+540 = 810 minutes in 1 week The answer is 810.\n\n\nQ: On the first day of the journey, the Skipper sailed his ship halfway to the destination by traveling due east for 20 hours at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour, and then turned the ship's engines off to let them cool down. But while the engines were off, a wind storm blew his vessel backward in a westward direction.  After the storm, the Skipper used his GPS device to determine the new location of the ship, and he discovered that he was only one-third of the way to his destination.  How many kilometers had the ship been blown in a westward direction by the storm?\nA: Let's think step by step. Traveling 20 hours due east at 30 kilometers per hour, the ship sailed 20*30=<<20*30=600>>600 kilometers the first day. If half the distance to the destination is 600 kilometers, then 2*600=<<2*600=1200>>1200 kilometers is the total distance from start to destination. One-third of the distance from start to destination is 1/3 * 1200 = <<1200/3=400>>400 kilometers. Thus, the wind storm blew the ship in a westward direction for 600 - 400 = <<600-400=200>>200 kilometers. The answer is 200.\n\n\nQ: Madeline has 5 boxes with 24 crayons in each. She noticed that 5/8 of the crayons in the 2 boxes were not yet used. In the 2 other boxes, only 2/3 of the crayons were used while the last box was not entirely used. How many unused crayons did Madeline have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Two boxes of crayons have 24 x 5/8 = <<24*5/8=15>>15 unused crayons from each box. So, a total of 15 x 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 unused crayons are in the two boxes. For the other 2 boxes, there are 24 x 2/3 = <<24*2/3=16>>16 used crayons from each box. Hence, there are 24 - 16 = <<24-16=8>>8 unused crayons. So, a total of 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 unused crayons are in the other two boxes. Therefore, Madeline has a total of 30 + 16 + 24 = <<30+16+24=70>>70 unused crayons. The answer is 70.\n\n\nQ: Tim drinks 2 bottles that are each 1.5 quarts and an additional 20 ounces a day.  How much water does he drink a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. The bottles are 1.5*32=<<1.5*32=48>>48 ounces So he drinks 48*2=<<48*2=96>>96 ounces from the bottles So in total he drank 96+20=<<96+20=116>>116 ounces a day 116*7=<<116*7=812>>812 ounces a week The answer is 812.\n\n\n"
