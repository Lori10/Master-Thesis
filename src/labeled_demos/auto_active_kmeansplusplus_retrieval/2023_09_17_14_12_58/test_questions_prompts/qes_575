  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Janice can type 6 sentences per minute. Today at work, Janice continued working on a paper she started typing yesterday. She typed for 20 minutes, took a break, and typed 15 minutes longer. She then had to erase 40 sentences she had typed incorrectly. After a meeting, she typed for 18 minutes more. In all, the paper had 536 sentences by the end of today. How many sentences did she start with today?\nA: Let's think step by step. Janice had X sentences from yesterday already typed to start with today. Janice typed 6 * 20 = <<6*20=120>>120 sentences before her break. She typed 6 * 15 = <<6*15=90>>90 sentences after her break. She typed 6 * 18 = <<6*18=108>>108 sentences after her meeting. Therefore, she typed 120 + 90 + 108 = <<120+90+108=318>>318 sentences today in all. She had to erase 40 sentences, so she had 318 - 40 = <<318-40=278>>278 sentences that she typed today left. The paper had X + 278 = 536 sentences at the end of today. Thus, she had X = 536 - 278 = <<536-278=258>>258 sentences typed on the paper to start with today. The answer is 258.\n\n\nQ: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Bertha wears out 20 / 10 = <<20/10=2>>2 tennis balls in 20 games. She loses 20 / 5 = <<20/5=4>>4 tennis balls in 20 games. She buys canisters of 3 * 20 / 4 = <<3*20/4=15>>15 tennis balls in 20 games. Bertha started with 2 balls and gave 1 away, so she has 2 + 15 - 2 - 4 - 1 = <<2+15-2-4-1=10>>10 tennis balls after twenty games. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Mr. McNeely takes a register of the total number of students present in class every day. On a particular week, the number of students in the class on the second day was 40 more than the first day. The number of students who didn't turn up for the class on the second day was twice the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day. On the third day, 1/7 of the total number of students of the class called in sick. If the total number of students in the class is 280, calculate the number of absent students in the three days.\nA: Let's think step by step. On the third day, 1/7*280 = <<1/7*280=40>>40 students called in sick. If the number of students absent on the second day was twice the number on the third day, then 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80 students didn't show up for the class on the second day. The total number of students present in the class on the second day was 280-80= <<280-80=200>>200. If 40 fewer students showed up for the class on the first day than on the second day, then 200-40 = <<200-40=160>>160 students showed up for the class on the first day. The number of students absent on the first day is 280-160 = <<280-160=120>>120 In the three days, the total number of absentees is 120+80+40 = <<120+80+40=240>>240 The answer is 240.\n\n\nQ: Phoebe has two pizzas to share with her and three friends. One has pepperoni and the other has cheese. They both have 16 slices. They all eat the same amount. One friend eats only pepperoni, while the rest have an equal number of slices of each. At the end, there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese, how many slices does each person eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. They are 9 slices of cheese because 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 They ate three slices of cheese each because 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3 They are 6 slices each in total because 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Ryan works in an office that has an even number of men and women working there.  Ryan participates in a meeting composed of 4 men and 6 women who are pulled from the office floor.   This reduces the number of women working on the office floor by 20%.  How many people work at Ryan's office?\nA: Let's think step by step. Since 6 women are 20% of the total number of women working there, that means there are 6*5= <<6*5=30>>30 women working there in total. Since there are an even number of women and men working in the office, that means there are 30*2= <<30*2=60>>60 people working there in total, since there are 2 sexes. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: An apple tree has three times as many apples as the number of plums on a plum tree. If Damien picks 3/5 of the fruits from the trees, calculate the total number of plums and apples remaining on the tree if there were 180 apples on the apple tree before Damien picked any of the fruits.\nA: Let's think step by step. Initially, the were 180//3= <<180//3=60>>60 plums on the plum tree. When Damien picked 3/5 of the apples from the apple tree, he picked 3/5*180 = <<3/5*180=108>>108 apples The number of apples remaining on the apple tree is 180-108= <<180-108=72>>72 The number of plums that Damien picked from the plum tree is 3/5*60 = <<3/5*60=36>>36 The number of plums remaining on the plum tree is 60-36 = <<60-36=24>>24 The total number of fruits remaining on the trees is 72 apples+24 plums = <<72+24=96>>96 The answer is 96.\n\n\nQ: Aimee does a poll around her neighborhood and makes sure to get answers from 50% men and 50% women. She finds that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. How many people did she poll?\nA: Let's think step by step. 65% of women are opposed to the idea because 100 - 35 = <<100-35=65>>65 There are 60 women in the poll because 39 / .65 = <<39/.65=60>>60 There were 120 people in her poll because 60 / .5 = <<60/.5=120>>120 The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First subtract the 7 double-counted animals from Mary's total: 60 animals - 7 animals = <<60-7=53>>53 animals Then add the animals she missed to find the real total: 53 animals + 3 pigs = <<53+3=56>>56 animals The answer is 56.\n\n\n"
