  "test_question": "Q: John injured his back and needs to go to physical therapy.  He went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.  Each week he went twice for 2 hours at a time.  If the sessions cost $125 per hour how much did the physical therapy cost?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: John adopts a dog from a shelter.  The dog ends up having health problems and this requires 3 vet appointments,  which cost $400 each.  After the first appointment, John paid $100 for pet insurance that covers 80% of the subsequent visits.  How much did he pay in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. He got a discount of 400*.8=$<<400*.8=320>>320 He got that discount for 3-1=<<3-1=2>>2 visits So each of those visits cost 400-320=$<<400-320=80>>80 So he paid 2*80=$<<2*80=160>>160 for those visits That means he paid a total of 400+160+100=$<<400+160+100=660>>660 The answer is 660.\n\n\nQ: Logan makes $65,000 a year. He spends $20,000 on rent every year, $5000 on groceries every year, and $8000 on gas every year. If he wants to have at least $42000 left, how much more money must he make each year?\nA: Let's think step by step. Logan spends 20000+5000+8000 = <<20000+5000+8000=33000>>33000 a year. Logan has 65000-33000 = <<65000-33000=32000>>32000 left a year. Logan needs to make 42000-32000 = <<42000-32000=10000>>10000 more a year. The answer is 10000.\n\n\nQ: James buys $3000 worth of stuff from Amazon.  He has to return a TV that cost $700 and a bike that cost $500.  He also sells another bike that cost 20% more than the bike he returned for 80% of what he bought it for.  He then buys a toaster for $100.  How much is he out of pocket for everything?\nA: Let's think step by step. The items he returned were valued at $700 + $500 = $<<700+500=1200>>1200 So far he is out 3000-1200 = <<3000-1200=1800>>1800 after recouping 1200. An item that is 20% more expensive cost 1 + .2 = 1.2 times as much as the item So that means the bike he sold cost $500 * 1.2 = $<<500*1.2=600>>600 He sold it for $600 * .8 = $<<600*.8=480>>480 From the bike that he had bought for 600, he was out 600-480 =<<600-480=120>>120 So far he is out 1800+120 = <<1800+120=1920>>1920 If he also bought a toaster worth 100, he was out 1920+100 = <<1920+100=2020>>2020 The answer is 2020.\n\n\nQ: Samuel is going to the cinema with his brother, Kevin. They both have a total budget of $20 for their outing. Samuel buys his $14 ticket, then spends $6 on drinks and food. Kevin buys his ticket, then spends $2 on drinks. They have both used their entire budget. How much did Kevin spend on food?\nA: Let's think step by step. We know Kevin bought a ticket and drinks, and this cost him 14 + 2 = <<14+2=16>>16 dollars. Since Kevin spent his entire budget, his food must have cost 20 \u2013 16 = <<20-16=4>>4 dollars. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Hank reads the newspaper every morning, 5 days a week for 30 minutes.  He reads part of a novel every evening, 5 days a week, for 1 hour.  He doubles his reading time on Saturday and Sundays.  How many minutes does Hank spend reading in 1 week?\nA: Let's think step by step. He reads 30 minutes in the morning 5 days a week for a total of 30*5 = <<30*5=150>>150 minutes He doubles his reading time on the weekends so 30*2 = <<30*2=60>>60 minutes per day He reads 60 minutes on Saturday and Sunday in the mornings for a total of 60+60 = <<60+60=120>>120 minutes He reads 1 hour in the evenings 5 days a week for a total of 1*5 = <<1*5=5>>5 hours He doubles his reading time on the weekends so 1*2 = <<1*2=2>>2 hours per day He reads 2 hours on Saturday and Sunday in the evenings for a total of 2+2 = <<2+2=4>>4 hours He read 5+4 = 9 hours which, when converted to minutes is 9*60 = 540 minutes He reads 150 minutes in the morning and 120 minutes in the evenings and 540 over the weekend for a total of 150+120+540 = 810 minutes in 1 week The answer is 810.\n\n\nQ: Enrique has 2 132 contracts that he needs to shred.  His paper shredder will only allow him to shred 6 pages at a time.  How many times will he shred 6 units of paper until all of the contracts are shredded?\nA: Let's think step by step. He has 2 contracts that are 132 pages each so that's 2*132 = <<2*132=264>>264 pages He can only shred 6 pages at a time so it will take him 264/6 = <<264/6=44>>44 units The answer is 44.\n\n\nQ: Carlos and Diego are racing around the block. Carlos runs around the entire block in 3 minutes. Diego runs around half the block in 2.5 minutes and then is tripped by a dog and can't finish. Assuming he kept up the same speed the entire race, what would've been the average time in seconds for the racers?\nA: Let's think step by step. If he finished the race, it would've taken 5 minutes because 2.5 x 2 = <<2.5*2=5>>5 Their total time would've been 8 minutes because 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 The average would've been 4 minutes because 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 The average time in seconds would've been 240 because 4 x 60 = <<4*60=240>>240 The answer is 240.\n\n\nQ: Janice can type 6 sentences per minute. Today at work, Janice continued working on a paper she started typing yesterday. She typed for 20 minutes, took a break, and typed 15 minutes longer. She then had to erase 40 sentences she had typed incorrectly. After a meeting, she typed for 18 minutes more. In all, the paper had 536 sentences by the end of today. How many sentences did she start with today?\nA: Let's think step by step. Janice had X sentences from yesterday already typed to start with today. Janice typed 6 * 20 = <<6*20=120>>120 sentences before her break. She typed 6 * 15 = <<6*15=90>>90 sentences after her break. She typed 6 * 18 = <<6*18=108>>108 sentences after her meeting. Therefore, she typed 120 + 90 + 108 = <<120+90+108=318>>318 sentences today in all. She had to erase 40 sentences, so she had 318 - 40 = <<318-40=278>>278 sentences that she typed today left. The paper had X + 278 = 536 sentences at the end of today. Thus, she had X = 536 - 278 = <<536-278=258>>258 sentences typed on the paper to start with today. The answer is 258.\n\n\n"
