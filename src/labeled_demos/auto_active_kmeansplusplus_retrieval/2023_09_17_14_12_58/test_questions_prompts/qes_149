  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Selina is selling some of her old clothes to a second-hand store. They will buy her pants for $5 each, her shorts for $3 each, and her shirts for $4 each. She sells 3 pairs of pants, 5 pairs of shorts, and some shirts. After she gets her money, she sees 2 shirts that she likes which cost $10 each and buys them. She leaves the store with $30. How many shirts did she sell to the store?\nA: Let's think step by step. The shirts she bought cost her $20 because 2 x 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 She earned $50 selling her clothes because 20 + 30 = <<20+30=50>>50 She made $15 off pants because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 She made 15 dollars from shorts because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 She made $20 off shirts because 50 - 15 - 15 = <<50-15-15=20>>20 She sold 5 shirts because 20 / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Hank reads the newspaper every morning, 5 days a week for 30 minutes.  He reads part of a novel every evening, 5 days a week, for 1 hour.  He doubles his reading time on Saturday and Sundays.  How many minutes does Hank spend reading in 1 week?\nA: Let's think step by step. He reads 30 minutes in the morning 5 days a week for a total of 30*5 = <<30*5=150>>150 minutes He doubles his reading time on the weekends so 30*2 = <<30*2=60>>60 minutes per day He reads 60 minutes on Saturday and Sunday in the mornings for a total of 60+60 = <<60+60=120>>120 minutes He reads 1 hour in the evenings 5 days a week for a total of 1*5 = <<1*5=5>>5 hours He doubles his reading time on the weekends so 1*2 = <<1*2=2>>2 hours per day He reads 2 hours on Saturday and Sunday in the evenings for a total of 2+2 = <<2+2=4>>4 hours He read 5+4 = 9 hours which, when converted to minutes is 9*60 = 540 minutes He reads 150 minutes in the morning and 120 minutes in the evenings and 540 over the weekend for a total of 150+120+540 = 810 minutes in 1 week The answer is 810.\n\n\nQ: Janice can type 6 sentences per minute. Today at work, Janice continued working on a paper she started typing yesterday. She typed for 20 minutes, took a break, and typed 15 minutes longer. She then had to erase 40 sentences she had typed incorrectly. After a meeting, she typed for 18 minutes more. In all, the paper had 536 sentences by the end of today. How many sentences did she start with today?\nA: Let's think step by step. Janice had X sentences from yesterday already typed to start with today. Janice typed 6 * 20 = <<6*20=120>>120 sentences before her break. She typed 6 * 15 = <<6*15=90>>90 sentences after her break. She typed 6 * 18 = <<6*18=108>>108 sentences after her meeting. Therefore, she typed 120 + 90 + 108 = <<120+90+108=318>>318 sentences today in all. She had to erase 40 sentences, so she had 318 - 40 = <<318-40=278>>278 sentences that she typed today left. The paper had X + 278 = 536 sentences at the end of today. Thus, she had X = 536 - 278 = <<536-278=258>>258 sentences typed on the paper to start with today. The answer is 258.\n\n\nQ: Steve has a bank account that earns 10% interest every year. He puts $100 in it, and then 10 each year. How much money is in it after two years?\nA: Let's think step by step. After one year it earns $10 in interest because 100 x .1 = <<100*.1=10>>10 It has $120 in it after a year because 100 + 10 + 10 = <<100+10+10=120>>120 In the second year it earns $12 in interest because 120 x .1 = <<120*.1=12>>12 In the second year it has $142 in it because 120 + 12 + 10 = <<120+12+10=142>>142 The answer is 142.\n\n\nQ: Logan makes $65,000 a year. He spends $20,000 on rent every year, $5000 on groceries every year, and $8000 on gas every year. If he wants to have at least $42000 left, how much more money must he make each year?\nA: Let's think step by step. Logan spends 20000+5000+8000 = <<20000+5000+8000=33000>>33000 a year. Logan has 65000-33000 = <<65000-33000=32000>>32000 left a year. Logan needs to make 42000-32000 = <<42000-32000=10000>>10000 more a year. The answer is 10000.\n\n\nQ: Aimee does a poll around her neighborhood and makes sure to get answers from 50% men and 50% women. She finds that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. How many people did she poll?\nA: Let's think step by step. 65% of women are opposed to the idea because 100 - 35 = <<100-35=65>>65 There are 60 women in the poll because 39 / .65 = <<39/.65=60>>60 There were 120 people in her poll because 60 / .5 = <<60/.5=120>>120 The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: The ratio of the amount of money Cara, Janet, and Jerry have is 4:5:6. If the total amount of money they have is $75, calculate the loss Cara and Janet will make if they combine their money to buy oranges and sell them at 80% of the buying price.\nA: Let's think step by step. The sum of the ratios representing the amount of money the three has is 4+5+6=<<4+5+6=15>>15 If the total amount of money they have is $75, the amount of money Cara has represented by the fraction 4/15 is 4/15*$75=$<<4/15*75=20>>20 Similarly, the amount of money Janet has represented by the fraction 5/15 of the total ratio is 5/15*$75=$<<5/15*75=25>>25 Combined, Cara and Janet have $20+25=$<<20+25=45>>45 If Cara and Janet buy goods worth $45 and sells them at 80% of the buying price, the selling price of the goods will be 80/100*$45=$<<45*80/100=36>>36 Since they bought the goods at $45 and sold them at $36, Janet and Cara would run at a loss of $45-$36=$<<45-36=9>>9 The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Ryan works in an office that has an even number of men and women working there.  Ryan participates in a meeting composed of 4 men and 6 women who are pulled from the office floor.   This reduces the number of women working on the office floor by 20%.  How many people work at Ryan's office?\nA: Let's think step by step. Since 6 women are 20% of the total number of women working there, that means there are 6*5= <<6*5=30>>30 women working there in total. Since there are an even number of women and men working in the office, that means there are 30*2= <<30*2=60>>60 people working there in total, since there are 2 sexes. The answer is 60.\n\n\n"
