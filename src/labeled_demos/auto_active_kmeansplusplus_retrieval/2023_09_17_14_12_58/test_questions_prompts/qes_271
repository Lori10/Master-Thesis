  "test_question": "Q: A landscaping company is delivering flagstones to a customer\u2019s yard. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. If the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, how many trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Timmy, Tommy and Tina are filling up a kiddie pool in their backyard.  Each has a pail they fill with water from a house before dumping it into the pool.  If Timmy's pail holds twice as much water as Tommy's, and Tommy's holds 2 gallons more than Tina's, and Tina's is 4 gallons, how much water do the three of them fill the pool with after 3 trips each?\nA: Let's think step by step. If Tina's pail holds 4 gallons and Tommy's holds 2 more gallons than hers, that means Tommy's holds 4+2=<<4+2=6>>6 gallons. If Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's 6-gallon pail, that means it holds 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 gallons. Therefore, in 1 trip that means all three move a total of 4+6+12=<<4+6+12=22>>22 gallons. In three trips, that means they would move a total of 22*3=<<22*3=66>>66 gallons The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: On the first day of the journey, the Skipper sailed his ship halfway to the destination by traveling due east for 20 hours at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour, and then turned the ship's engines off to let them cool down. But while the engines were off, a wind storm blew his vessel backward in a westward direction.  After the storm, the Skipper used his GPS device to determine the new location of the ship, and he discovered that he was only one-third of the way to his destination.  How many kilometers had the ship been blown in a westward direction by the storm?\nA: Let's think step by step. Traveling 20 hours due east at 30 kilometers per hour, the ship sailed 20*30=<<20*30=600>>600 kilometers the first day. If half the distance to the destination is 600 kilometers, then 2*600=<<2*600=1200>>1200 kilometers is the total distance from start to destination. One-third of the distance from start to destination is 1/3 * 1200 = <<1200/3=400>>400 kilometers. Thus, the wind storm blew the ship in a westward direction for 600 - 400 = <<600-400=200>>200 kilometers. The answer is 200.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. 20% of her 40 students will bring their own life vest so .20*40 = <<.20*40=8>>8 students will bring their life vests Alice has 20 life vests and 8 students will bring there's so that's 20+8 = <<20+8=28>>28 life vests There are 40 students and 10 instructors total so that's 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 people in the class If there are 28 life vests and she has 50 people then she needs to find 50-28 = 22 more life vests The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Logan makes $65,000 a year. He spends $20,000 on rent every year, $5000 on groceries every year, and $8000 on gas every year. If he wants to have at least $42000 left, how much more money must he make each year?\nA: Let's think step by step. Logan spends 20000+5000+8000 = <<20000+5000+8000=33000>>33000 a year. Logan has 65000-33000 = <<65000-33000=32000>>32000 left a year. Logan needs to make 42000-32000 = <<42000-32000=10000>>10000 more a year. The answer is 10000.\n\n\nQ: James wants to build a ladder to climb a very tall tree.  Each rung of the ladder is 18 inches long and they are 6 inches apart.  If he needs to climb 50 feet how many feet of wood will he need for the rungs?\nA: Let's think step by step. He needs 12/6=<<12/6=2>>2 rungs per foot So he needs 50*2=<<50*2=100>>100 rungs Each rung is 18/12=<<18/12=1.5>>1.5 feet So he needs 1.5*100=<<1.5*100=150>>150 feet The answer is 150.\n\n\nQ: Aimee does a poll around her neighborhood and makes sure to get answers from 50% men and 50% women. She finds that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. How many people did she poll?\nA: Let's think step by step. 65% of women are opposed to the idea because 100 - 35 = <<100-35=65>>65 There are 60 women in the poll because 39 / .65 = <<39/.65=60>>60 There were 120 people in her poll because 60 / .5 = <<60/.5=120>>120 The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: Emery's family decides to travel for a weekend trip. They drive the first 100 miles in 1 hour. They stop at a McDonald's and then continue the rest of the journey for 300 miles. What's the total number of hours they traveled?\nA: Let's think step by step. If the first 100 miles took one hour, then let's say the next 300 miles took x hours. if 100 miles = 1 hour, then 300 miles =x. To find the number of hours traveled for the 300 miles, x = 300*1/100 x= <<3=3>>3 hours. The total number of hours will be 3 +1 = <<3+1=4>>4 hours The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Harrison Elementary School is overcrowded with 1590 students, so 40% of the students are going to move to a new school. There are 3 grade levels, and each grade level needs one 20-person advanced class and the rest of the students divided evenly into 6 additional classes. How many students will there be in each normal class at the new school?\nA: Let's think step by step. First find how many students go to the new school: 1590 students * .4 = <<1590*.4=636>>636 students Then divide that number by 3 to find how many students are at each grade level: 636 students / 3 grades = <<636/3=212>>212 students/grade Then subtract the 20 students in the gifted class: 212 students - 20 students = <<212-20=192>>192 students Then divide that number by 6 to find the number of students in each other class: 192 students / 6 classes = <<192/6=32>>32 students/class The answer is 32.\n\n\n"
