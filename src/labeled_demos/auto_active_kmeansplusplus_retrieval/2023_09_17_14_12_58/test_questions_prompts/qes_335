  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Alyssa took 100 photos on vacation. She wants to put them in a photo album with 30 pages. She can place 3 photos each on the first 10 pages. Then she can place 4 photos each on the next 10 pages. If she wants to put an equal number of photos on each of the remaining pages of the album, how many photos can she place on each page?\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 3 x 10 = <<3*10=30>>30 photos in total that can be placed in the first 10 pages. There are 4 x 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 photos in total that can be placed in the next 10 pages. A total of 10 + 10 = <<10+10=20>>20 pages of the album have been used. A total of 30 + 40 = <<30+40=70>>70 photos can be placed on those 20 pages. So there are still 100 - 70 = <<100-70=30>>30 photos left to be placed on the album. And there are 30 - 20 = <<30-20=10>>10 pages left in the album. Therefore, 30/10 = <<30/10=3>>3 photos can be placed on each of the pages. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Bertha wears out 20 / 10 = <<20/10=2>>2 tennis balls in 20 games. She loses 20 / 5 = <<20/5=4>>4 tennis balls in 20 games. She buys canisters of 3 * 20 / 4 = <<3*20/4=15>>15 tennis balls in 20 games. Bertha started with 2 balls and gave 1 away, so she has 2 + 15 - 2 - 4 - 1 = <<2+15-2-4-1=10>>10 tennis balls after twenty games. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Logan makes $65,000 a year. He spends $20,000 on rent every year, $5000 on groceries every year, and $8000 on gas every year. If he wants to have at least $42000 left, how much more money must he make each year?\nA: Let's think step by step. Logan spends 20000+5000+8000 = <<20000+5000+8000=33000>>33000 a year. Logan has 65000-33000 = <<65000-33000=32000>>32000 left a year. Logan needs to make 42000-32000 = <<42000-32000=10000>>10000 more a year. The answer is 10000.\n\n\nQ: A soccer team had 24 players prepared for a soccer game. The first half saw 11 players start the game with 2 substitutions made. In the second half, the team made twice as many substitutions as it made in the first half. How many players on the team did not play that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. With two substitutions, 11+2 = <<11+2=13>>13 players from the team played the game in the first half. In the second half, the team made twice the number of substitutions it made in the first half, a total of 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 substitutions. The total number of players who played the game is 13+4 = <<13+4=17>>17 If the soccer team had 24 players prepared for the soccer game, the number of players who did not play the game is 24-17 = <<24-17=7>>7 players. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Alexander draws 9 pictures for an exhibition at a gallery. 5 new galleries also want Alexander to draw for them, so he draws pictures for their exhibitions too. Each of these new galleries receives the same amount of pictures. For each picture, Alexander needs 4 pencils. For each exhibition, he needs another 2 pencils for signing his signature on the pictures. If Alexander uses 88 pencils on drawing and signing his pictures for all of the exhibitions, how many paintings are at each of the 5 new galleries?\nA: Let's think step by step. Alexander has sent pictures to a total of 1 original gallery + 5 new galleries = <<1+5=6>>6 galleries. For signatures, he has used a total of 6 galleries * 2 pencils per gallery = <<6*2=12>>12 pencils. So of the pencils that he used, 88 total pencils \u2013 12 signature pencils = <<88-12=76>>76 pencils for drawings. At the first gallery, he used 9 pictures * 4 pencils per picture = <<9*4=36>>36 pencils. So in the new galleries, he used 76 total pencils for drawings \u2013 36 pencils at the first gallery = <<76-36=40>>40 pencils. The new galleries received a total of 40 pencils / 4 pencils per picture = <<40/4=10>>10 pictures. As the new galleries all receive equal amounts of pictures, each gallery must have 10 pictures / 5 galleries = <<10/5=2>>2 pictures per gallery. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: The ratio of the amount of money Cara, Janet, and Jerry have is 4:5:6. If the total amount of money they have is $75, calculate the loss Cara and Janet will make if they combine their money to buy oranges and sell them at 80% of the buying price.\nA: Let's think step by step. The sum of the ratios representing the amount of money the three has is 4+5+6=<<4+5+6=15>>15 If the total amount of money they have is $75, the amount of money Cara has represented by the fraction 4/15 is 4/15*$75=$<<4/15*75=20>>20 Similarly, the amount of money Janet has represented by the fraction 5/15 of the total ratio is 5/15*$75=$<<5/15*75=25>>25 Combined, Cara and Janet have $20+25=$<<20+25=45>>45 If Cara and Janet buy goods worth $45 and sells them at 80% of the buying price, the selling price of the goods will be 80/100*$45=$<<45*80/100=36>>36 Since they bought the goods at $45 and sold them at $36, Janet and Cara would run at a loss of $45-$36=$<<45-36=9>>9 The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: At the duck park, there are 25 mallard ducks and ten less than twice as many geese as ducks.  Then, a small flock of 4 ducks arrived at the park and joined the birds already there.  If five less than 15 geese leave the park, how many more geese than ducks remain at the park?\nA: Let's think step by step. Initially, twice as many geese as ducks is 25*2=<<25*2=50>>50 geese. Therefore, ten less than twice as many geese as ducks is 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 geese. Then, 4 ducks arrived at the park, resulting in 25+4=<<4+25=29>>29 ducks. Five less than 15 geese is 15-5=<<15-5=10>>10 geese. Thus, if 5 less than 15 geese leave, then 40-10=30 geese remain. Thus, there are 30-29=<<30-29=1>>1 more geese than ducks remaining at the park. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First subtract the 7 double-counted animals from Mary's total: 60 animals - 7 animals = <<60-7=53>>53 animals Then add the animals she missed to find the real total: 53 animals + 3 pigs = <<53+3=56>>56 animals The answer is 56.\n\n\n"
