  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Patricia is growing her long very long to donate it to a charity that makes wigs for cancer survivors. Her hair is 14 inches long. She needs to donate 23 inches to make a wig. She wants her hair to be 12 inches long after the donation. How much longer does she have to grow her hair?\nA: Let's think step by step. Her hair needs to be 35 inches long when she cuts it because 23 + 12 = <<23+12=35>>35 She needs to grow it 21 more inches because 35 - 14 = <<35-14=21>>21 The answer is 21.\n\n\nQ: Tricia is a third of Amilia\u2019s age and Amilia is a quarter of Yorick\u2019s age. Yorick is twice Eugene\u2019s age and Khloe is a third of Eugene\u2019s age. Rupert is 10 years older than Khloe but 2 years younger than Vincent who is 22 years old. How old, in years, is Tricia?\nA: Let's think step by step. Rupert is younger than Vincent by 2 years, so he is 22 years old \u2013 2 years = <<22-2=20>>20 years old. Khloe is 10 years younger than Rupert so she is 20 years old \u2013 10 years = 10 years old. Eugene is 3 times older than Khloe so he is 10 years old * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 years old. Yorick is twice Eugene\u2019s age so he is 30 years old * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 years old. Amilia is a quarter of Yorick\u2019s age so she is 60 years old / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 years old. Tricia is a third of Amilia\u2019s age so she is 15 years old / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 years old. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Michael has two brothers. His oldest brother is 1 year older than twice Michael's age when Michael was a year younger. His younger brother is 5 years old, which is a third of the age of the older brother. What is their combined age?\nA: Let's think step by step. The oldest brother is 15 because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 Michael is 8 because if 1 + (Michael's age - 1) x 2 = 15 then Michael's age = 8 Their combined age is 28 because 5 + 15 + 8 = <<5+15+8=28>>28 The answer is 28.\n\n\nQ: Aimee does a poll around her neighborhood and makes sure to get answers from 50% men and 50% women. She finds that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. How many people did she poll?\nA: Let's think step by step. 65% of women are opposed to the idea because 100 - 35 = <<100-35=65>>65 There are 60 women in the poll because 39 / .65 = <<39/.65=60>>60 There were 120 people in her poll because 60 / .5 = <<60/.5=120>>120 The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: Harrison Elementary School is overcrowded with 1590 students, so 40% of the students are going to move to a new school. There are 3 grade levels, and each grade level needs one 20-person advanced class and the rest of the students divided evenly into 6 additional classes. How many students will there be in each normal class at the new school?\nA: Let's think step by step. First find how many students go to the new school: 1590 students * .4 = <<1590*.4=636>>636 students Then divide that number by 3 to find how many students are at each grade level: 636 students / 3 grades = <<636/3=212>>212 students/grade Then subtract the 20 students in the gifted class: 212 students - 20 students = <<212-20=192>>192 students Then divide that number by 6 to find the number of students in each other class: 192 students / 6 classes = <<192/6=32>>32 students/class The answer is 32.\n\n\nQ: Logan makes $65,000 a year. He spends $20,000 on rent every year, $5000 on groceries every year, and $8000 on gas every year. If he wants to have at least $42000 left, how much more money must he make each year?\nA: Let's think step by step. Logan spends 20000+5000+8000 = <<20000+5000+8000=33000>>33000 a year. Logan has 65000-33000 = <<65000-33000=32000>>32000 left a year. Logan needs to make 42000-32000 = <<42000-32000=10000>>10000 more a year. The answer is 10000.\n\n\nQ: Selina is selling some of her old clothes to a second-hand store. They will buy her pants for $5 each, her shorts for $3 each, and her shirts for $4 each.

How many shirts did she sell to the store?\nA: Let's think step by step. The shirts she bought cost her $20 because 2 x 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 She earned $50 selling her clothes because 20 + 30 = <<20+30=50>>50 She made $15 off pants because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 She made 15 dollars from shorts because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 She made $20 off shirts because 50 - 15 - 15 = <<50-15-15=20>>20 She sold 5 shirts because 20 / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Phoebe has two pizzas to share with her and three friends. One has pepperoni and the other has cheese. They both have 16 slices. They all eat the same amount. One friend eats only pepperoni, while the rest have an equal number of slices of each. At the end, there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese, how many slices does each person eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. They are 9 slices of cheese because 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 They ate three slices of cheese each because 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3 They are 6 slices each in total because 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 The answer is 6.\n\n\n"
