  "test_question": "Q: April is donating plant pots to a local school for their new garden. They ask for 30 plant pots for the daisies, and twice as many for the roses. April had already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center before she knew how many she needed. How many plant pots does April have left over?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: An apple tree has three times as many apples as the number of plums on a plum tree. If Damien picks 3/5 of the fruits from the trees, calculate the total number of plums and apples remaining on the tree if there were 180 apples on the apple tree before Damien picked any of the fruits.\nA: Let's think step by step. Initially, the were 180//3= <<180//3=60>>60 plums on the plum tree. When Damien picked 3/5 of the apples from the apple tree, he picked 3/5*180 = <<3/5*180=108>>108 apples The number of apples remaining on the apple tree is 180-108= <<180-108=72>>72 The number of plums that Damien picked from the plum tree is 3/5*60 = <<3/5*60=36>>36 The number of plums remaining on the plum tree is 60-36 = <<60-36=24>>24 The total number of fruits remaining on the trees is 72 apples+24 plums = <<72+24=96>>96 The answer is 96.\n\n\nQ: Hazel put up a lemonade stand. She sold half her lemonade to a construction crew. She sold 18 cups to kids on bikes. She gave away half that amount to her friends. Then she drank the last cup of lemonade herself. How many cups of lemonade did Hazel make?\nA: Let's think step by step. Hazel sold 18 cups of lemonade to kids on bikes and gave half that amount, or 18 / 2 = <<18/2=9>>9 cups, away to friends. Hazel sold 18 cups + gave away 9 cups + drank 1 cup = <<18+9+1=28>>28 cups. Since Hazel sold half her lemonade to a construction crew, that means the 28 cups she sold to kids on bikes, gave away to friends and drank herself are the other half, so she sold 28 cups to the construction crew. In all, Hazel sold 28 + 28 = <<28+28=56>>56 cups of lemonade. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Patricia is growing her long very long to donate it to a charity that makes wigs for cancer survivors. Her hair is 14 inches long. She needs to donate 23 inches to make a wig. She wants her hair to be 12 inches long after the donation. How much longer does she have to grow her hair?\nA: Let's think step by step. Her hair needs to be 35 inches long when she cuts it because 23 + 12 = <<23+12=35>>35 She needs to grow it 21 more inches because 35 - 14 = <<35-14=21>>21 The answer is 21.\n\n\nQ: Bea's mom planted 50 Mahogany and 30 Narra trees on their farm. Due to a typhoon, a total of 5 trees fell. One more Mahogany tree fell than the number of Narra trees that fell. A month after the typhoon, Bea's mom planted twice as much as the number of the Narra and thrice the number of Mahogany trees that fell. How many trees are now on the farm?\nA: Let's think step by step. Before the typhoon, their farm had a total of 50 trees + 30 trees = <<50+30=80>>80 trees. If there was 1 more than Mahogany than Narra tree that fell, then this means there were 2 Narra trees and 2 + 1 = 3 Mahogany trees that fell during the typhoon. So, Bea's mom planted 2 trees x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 Narra trees. She also planted 3 trees x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 Mahogany trees. So, her mom planted 4 trees + 9 trees = <<4+9=13>>13 more trees. After the typhoon, they only had 80 trees - 5 trees = <<80-5=75>>75 trees left. Therefore, there are 75 trees + 13 trees = <<75+13=88>>88 trees now. The answer is 88.\n\n\nQ: Jill makes scented candles as a hobby. Her favorite scents are lavender, coconut, and almond, and she uses the same amount of each scent for every candle. This time, she made twice as many lavender candles as coconut candles, along with a batch of almond candles. She ran out of almond scent after making ten candles. If she had one and a half times as much coconut scent as almond scent and used all her coconut scent up too, how many lavender candles did she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. Jill made one and a half times as many coconut candles as almond candles, so she made 10 * 1 1/2 = 15 coconut candles. She made twice as many lavender candles as coconut candles, so she made 2 * 15 = <<2*15=30>>30 lavender candles. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: Timmy, Tommy and Tina are filling up a kiddie pool in their backyard.  Each has a pail they fill with water from a house before dumping it into the pool.  If Timmy's pail holds twice as much water as Tommy's, and Tommy's holds 2 gallons more than Tina's, and Tina's is 4 gallons, how much water do the three of them fill the pool with after 3 trips each?\nA: Let's think step by step. If Tina's pail holds 4 gallons and Tommy's holds 2 more gallons than hers, that means Tommy's holds 4+2=<<4+2=6>>6 gallons. If Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's 6-gallon pail, that means it holds 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 gallons. Therefore, in 1 trip that means all three move a total of 4+6+12=<<4+6+12=22>>22 gallons. In three trips, that means they would move a total of 22*3=<<22*3=66>>66 gallons The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: An elementary school teacher is making Halloween goodie bags for her class.  She wants the bags to be personalized, so she surveys her students asking whether they'd like a vampire-themed bag or a pumpkin-themed bag.  Of her 25 students, 11 indicate they want the vampire-themed bag and 14 indicate they want the pumpkin-themed bag.  The store the teacher shops at sells packs of 5 of each theme at a price of $3 per package, as well as individual bags of each theme at a price of $1 each.  What is the least amount of money the teacher can spend on the bags if she buys every student the theme they requested?\nA: Let's think step by step. Because it is cheaper to buy the packs of 5, the teacher should satisfy the 11 students who want the vampire theme with 2 packs of 5 and 1 individual bag. This will cost the teacher 2*3 + 1*1 = $<<2*3+1*1=7>>7. Similarly, the 14 students who want a pumpkin-themed bag can be satisfied by 2 packs of 5 and 4 individual bags at a cost of 2*3 + 4*1 = $<<2*3+4*1=10>>10. Therefore, the teacher must spend 7 + 10 = $<<7+10=17>>17. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: At the duck park, there are 25 mallard ducks and ten less than twice as many geese as ducks.  Then, a small flock of 4 ducks arrived at the park and joined the birds already there.  If five less than 15 geese leave the park, how many more geese than ducks remain at the park?\nA: Let's think step by step. Initially, twice as many geese as ducks is 25*2=<<25*2=50>>50 geese. Therefore, ten less than twice as many geese as ducks is 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 geese. Then, 4 ducks arrived at the park, resulting in 25+4=<<4+25=29>>29 ducks. Five less than 15 geese is 15-5=<<15-5=10>>10 geese. Thus, if 5 less than 15 geese leave, then 40-10=30 geese remain. Thus, there are 30-29=<<30-29=1>>1 more geese than ducks remaining at the park. The answer is 1.\n\n\n"
