  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Michael has two brothers. His oldest brother is 1 year older than twice Michael's age when Michael was a year younger. His younger brother is 5 years old, which is a third of the age of the older brother. What is their combined age?\nA: Let's think step by step. The oldest brother is 15 because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 Michael is 8 because if 1 + (Michael's age - 1) x 2 = 15 then Michael's age = 8 Their combined age is 28 because 5 + 15 + 8 = <<5+15+8=28>>28 The answer is 28.\n\n\nQ: Tricia is a third of Amilia\u2019s age and Amilia is a quarter of Yorick\u2019s age. Yorick is twice Eugene\u2019s age and Khloe is a third of Eugene\u2019s age. Rupert is 10 years older than Khloe but 2 years younger than Vincent who is 22 years old. How old, in years, is Tricia?\nA: Let's think step by step. Rupert is younger than Vincent by 2 years, so he is 22 years old \u2013 2 years = <<22-2=20>>20 years old. Khloe is 10 years younger than Rupert so she is 20 years old \u2013 10 years = 10 years old. Eugene is 3 times older than Khloe so he is 10 years old * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 years old. Yorick is twice Eugene\u2019s age so he is 30 years old * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 years old. Amilia is a quarter of Yorick\u2019s age so she is 60 years old / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 years old. Tricia is a third of Amilia\u2019s age so she is 15 years old / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 years old. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: At the duck park, there are 25 mallard ducks and ten less than twice as many geese as ducks.  Then, a small flock of 4 ducks arrived at the park and joined the birds already there.  If five less than 15 geese leave the park, how many more geese than ducks remain at the park?\nA: Let's think step by step. Initially, twice as many geese as ducks is 25*2=<<25*2=50>>50 geese. Therefore, ten less than twice as many geese as ducks is 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 geese. Then, 4 ducks arrived at the park, resulting in 25+4=<<4+25=29>>29 ducks. Five less than 15 geese is 15-5=<<15-5=10>>10 geese. Thus, if 5 less than 15 geese leave, then 40-10=30 geese remain. Thus, there are 30-29=<<30-29=1>>1 more geese than ducks remaining at the park. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Logan makes $65,000 a year. He spends $20,000 on rent every year, $5000 on groceries every year, and $8000 on gas every year. If he wants to have at least $42000 left, how much more money must he make each year?\nA: Let's think step by step. Logan spends 20000+5000+8000 = <<20000+5000+8000=33000>>33000 a year. Logan has 65000-33000 = <<65000-33000=32000>>32000 left a year. Logan needs to make 42000-32000 = <<42000-32000=10000>>10000 more a year. The answer is 10000.\n\n\nQ: Samuel is going to the cinema with his brother, Kevin. They both have a total budget of $20 for their outing. Samuel buys his $14 ticket, then spends $6 on drinks and food. Kevin buys his ticket, then spends $2 on drinks. They have both used their entire budget. How much did Kevin spend on food?\nA: Let's think step by step. We know Kevin bought a ticket and drinks, and this cost him 14 + 2 = <<14+2=16>>16 dollars. Since Kevin spent his entire budget, his food must have cost 20 \u2013 16 = <<20-16=4>>4 dollars. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Phoebe has two pizzas to share with her and three friends. One has pepperoni and the other has cheese. They both have 16 slices. They all eat the same amount. One friend eats only pepperoni, while the rest have an equal number of slices of each. At the end, there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese, how many slices does each person eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. They are 9 slices of cheese because 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 They ate three slices of cheese each because 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3 They are 6 slices each in total because 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. 20% of her 40 students will bring their own life vest so .20*40 = <<.20*40=8>>8 students will bring their life vests Alice has 20 life vests and 8 students will bring there's so that's 20+8 = <<20+8=28>>28 life vests There are 40 students and 10 instructors total so that's 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 people in the class If there are 28 life vests and she has 50 people then she needs to find 50-28 = 22 more life vests The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Patricia is growing her long very long to donate it to a charity that makes wigs for cancer survivors.

How much longer does she have to grow her hair?\nA: Let's think step by step. Her hair needs to be 35 inches long when she cuts it because 23 + 12 = <<23+12=35>>35 She needs to grow it 21 more inches because 35 - 14 = <<35-14=21>>21 The answer is 21.\n\n\n"
