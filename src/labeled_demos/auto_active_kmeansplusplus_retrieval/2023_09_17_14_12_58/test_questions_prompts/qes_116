  "test_question": "Q: Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day.  If there are 16 cups in a gallon, how many gallons of water does she drink in 30 days?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Tim drinks 2 bottles that are each 1.5 quarts and an additional 20 ounces a day.  How much water does he drink a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. The bottles are 1.5*32=<<1.5*32=48>>48 ounces So he drinks 48*2=<<48*2=96>>96 ounces from the bottles So in total he drank 96+20=<<96+20=116>>116 ounces a day 116*7=<<116*7=812>>812 ounces a week The answer is 812.\n\n\nQ: Timmy, Tommy and Tina are filling up a kiddie pool in their backyard.  Each has a pail they fill with water from a house before dumping it into the pool.  If Timmy's pail holds twice as much water as Tommy's, and Tommy's holds 2 gallons more than Tina's, and Tina's is 4 gallons, how much water do the three of them fill the pool with after 3 trips each?\nA: Let's think step by step. If Tina's pail holds 4 gallons and Tommy's holds 2 more gallons than hers, that means Tommy's holds 4+2=<<4+2=6>>6 gallons. If Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's 6-gallon pail, that means it holds 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 gallons. Therefore, in 1 trip that means all three move a total of 4+6+12=<<4+6+12=22>>22 gallons. In three trips, that means they would move a total of 22*3=<<22*3=66>>66 gallons The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: Hazel put up a lemonade stand. She sold half her lemonade to a construction crew. She sold 18 cups to kids on bikes. She gave away half that amount to her friends. Then she drank the last cup of lemonade herself. How many cups of lemonade did Hazel make?\nA: Let's think step by step. Hazel sold 18 cups of lemonade to kids on bikes and gave half that amount, or 18 / 2 = <<18/2=9>>9 cups, away to friends. Hazel sold 18 cups + gave away 9 cups + drank 1 cup = <<18+9+1=28>>28 cups. Since Hazel sold half her lemonade to a construction crew, that means the 28 cups she sold to kids on bikes, gave away to friends and drank herself are the other half, so she sold 28 cups to the construction crew. In all, Hazel sold 28 + 28 = <<28+28=56>>56 cups of lemonade. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. 20% of her 40 students will bring their own life vest so .20*40 = <<.20*40=8>>8 students will bring their life vests Alice has 20 life vests and 8 students will bring there's so that's 20+8 = <<20+8=28>>28 life vests There are 40 students and 10 instructors total so that's 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 people in the class If there are 28 life vests and she has 50 people then she needs to find 50-28 = 22 more life vests The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Hank reads the newspaper every morning, 5 days a week for 30 minutes.  He reads part of a novel every evening, 5 days a week, for 1 hour.  He doubles his reading time on Saturday and Sundays.  How many minutes does Hank spend reading in 1 week?\nA: Let's think step by step. He reads 30 minutes in the morning 5 days a week for a total of 30*5 = <<30*5=150>>150 minutes He doubles his reading time on the weekends so 30*2 = <<30*2=60>>60 minutes per day He reads 60 minutes on Saturday and Sunday in the mornings for a total of 60+60 = <<60+60=120>>120 minutes He reads 1 hour in the evenings 5 days a week for a total of 1*5 = <<1*5=5>>5 hours He doubles his reading time on the weekends so 1*2 = <<1*2=2>>2 hours per day He reads 2 hours on Saturday and Sunday in the evenings for a total of 2+2 = <<2+2=4>>4 hours He read 5+4 = 9 hours which, when converted to minutes is 9*60 = 540 minutes He reads 150 minutes in the morning and 120 minutes in the evenings and 540 over the weekend for a total of 150+120+540 = 810 minutes in 1 week The answer is 810.\n\n\nQ: Janice can type 6 sentences per minute. Today at work, Janice continued working on a paper she started typing yesterday. She typed for 20 minutes, took a break, and typed 15 minutes longer. She then had to erase 40 sentences she had typed incorrectly. After a meeting, she typed for 18 minutes more. In all, the paper had 536 sentences by the end of today. How many sentences did she start with today?\nA: Let's think step by step. Janice had X sentences from yesterday already typed to start with today. Janice typed 6 * 20 = <<6*20=120>>120 sentences before her break. She typed 6 * 15 = <<6*15=90>>90 sentences after her break. She typed 6 * 18 = <<6*18=108>>108 sentences after her meeting. Therefore, she typed 120 + 90 + 108 = <<120+90+108=318>>318 sentences today in all. She had to erase 40 sentences, so she had 318 - 40 = <<318-40=278>>278 sentences that she typed today left. The paper had X + 278 = 536 sentences at the end of today. Thus, she had X = 536 - 278 = <<536-278=258>>258 sentences typed on the paper to start with today. The answer is 258.\n\n\nQ: John drinks 2 energy drinks. 1 of them is a 12-ounce drink with 250 grams of caffeine.  The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce but only 2 ounces.  He then takes a caffeine pill that has as much caffeine as his 2 drinks combined.  How much caffeine did he consume?\nA: Let's think step by step. The second drink was 2/12=1/6 the size of the first drink So it had 1/6*3=1/2 the caffeine That means it had 1/2*250=<<250/2=125>>125 grams of caffeine So the total amount of caffeine he drank was 125+250=<<125+250=375>>375 grams So he consumed 375*2=<<375*2=750>>750 grams of caffeine for the day The answer is 750.\n\n\nQ: Aimee does a poll around her neighborhood and makes sure to get answers from 50% men and 50% women. She finds that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. How many people did she poll?\nA: Let's think step by step. 65% of women are opposed to the idea because 100 - 35 = <<100-35=65>>65 There are 60 women in the poll because 39 / .65 = <<39/.65=60>>60 There were 120 people in her poll because 60 / .5 = <<60/.5=120>>120 The answer is 120.\n\n\n"
