  "formatted_prompt": "Q: James buys $3000 worth of stuff from Amazon.  He has to return a TV that cost $700 and a bike that cost $500.  He also sells another bike that cost 20% more than the bike he returned for 80% of what he bought it for.  He then buys a toaster for $100.  How much is he out of pocket for everything?\nA: Let's think step by step. The items he returned were valued at $700 + $500 = $<<700+500=1200>>1200 So far he is out 3000-1200 = <<3000-1200=1800>>1800 after recouping 1200. An item that is 20% more expensive cost 1 + .2 = 1.2 times as much as the item So that means the bike he sold cost $500 * 1.2 = $<<500*1.2=600>>600 He sold it for $600 * .8 = $<<600*.8=480>>480 From the bike that he had bought for 600, he was out 600-480 =<<600-480=120>>120 So far he is out 1800+120 = <<1800+120=1920>>1920 If he also bought a toaster worth 100, he was out 1920+100 = <<1920+100=2020>>2020 The answer is 2020.\n\n\nQ: Gwen received a $900 bonus at work and decided to invest this money in the stock market.  She spent one-third of her bonus on stock A, one-third on stock B, and the remaining one-third on stock C.   After one year, stock A and stock B had doubled in value, while stock C had lost half of its value.  At the end of the year, how much were Gwen's stocks worth, in dollars?\nA: Let's think step by step. One-third of her bonus was $900/3 = $<<900/3=300>>300. After one year, stock A doubled in value and was worth $300*2 = $<<300*2=600>>600. After one year, stock B doubled in value and was worth $300*2 = $<<300*2=600>>600. After one year, stock C had lost half its value and was worth $300/2 = $<<300/2=150>>150. Altogether, at the end of the year, Gwen's stocks were worth $600+$600+$150 = $<<600+600+150=1350>>1350 The answer is 1350.\n\n\nQ: Selina is selling some of her old clothes to a second-hand store. They will buy her pants for $5 each, her shorts for $3 each, and her shirts for $4 each. She sells 3 pairs of pants, 5 pairs of shorts, and some shirts. After she gets her money, she sees 2 shirts that she likes which cost $10 each and buys them. She leaves the store with $30. How many shirts did she sell to the store?\nA: Let's think step by step. The shirts she bought cost her $20 because 2 x 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 She earned $50 selling her clothes because 20 + 30 = <<20+30=50>>50 She made $15 off pants because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 She made 15 dollars from shorts because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 She made $20 off shirts because 50 - 15 - 15 = <<50-15-15=20>>20 She sold 5 shirts because 20 / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Logan makes $65,000 a year. He spends $20,000 on rent every year, $5000 on groceries every year, and $8000 on gas every year. If he wants to have at least $42000 left, how much more money must he make each year?\nA: Let's think step by step. Logan spends 20000+5000+8000 = <<20000+5000+8000=33000>>33000 a year. Logan has 65000-33000 = <<65000-33000=32000>>32000 left a year. Logan needs to make 42000-32000 = <<42000-32000=10000>>10000 more a year.

She wants the bags to be personalized, so she surveys her students asking whether they'd like a vampire-themed bag or a pumpkin-themed bag.  Of her 25 students, 11 indicate they want the vampire-themed bag and 14 indicate they want the pumpkin-themed bag.  The store the teacher shops at sells packs of 5 of each theme at a price of $3 per package, as well as individual bags of each theme at a price of $1 each.  What is the least amount of money the teacher can spend on the bags if she buys every student the theme they requested?\nA: Let's think step by step. Because it is cheaper to buy the packs of 5, the teacher should satisfy the 11 students who want the vampire theme with 2 packs of 5 and 1 individual bag. This will cost the teacher 2*3 + 1*1 = $<<2*3+1*1=7>>7. Similarly, the 14 students who want a pumpkin-themed bag can be satisfied by 2 packs of 5 and 4 individual bags at a cost of 2*3 + 4*1 = $<<2*3+4*1=10>>10. Therefore, the teacher must spend 7 + 10 = $<<7+10=17>>17. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Hank reads the newspaper every morning, 5 days a week for 30 minutes.  He reads part of a novel every evening, 5 days a week, for 1 hour.  He doubles his reading time on Saturday and Sundays.  How many minutes does Hank spend reading in 1 week?\nA: Let's think step by step. He reads 30 minutes in the morning 5 days a week for a total of 30*5 = <<30*5=150>>150 minutes He doubles his reading time on the weekends so 30*2 = <<30*2=60>>60 minutes per day He reads 60 minutes on Saturday and Sunday in the mornings for a total of 60+60 = <<60+60=120>>120 minutes He reads 1 hour in the evenings 5 days a week for a total of 1*5 = <<1*5=5>>5 hours He doubles his reading time on the weekends so 1*2 = <<1*2=2>>2 hours per day He reads 2 hours on Saturday and Sunday in the evenings for a total of 2+2 = <<2+2=4>>4 hours He read 5+4 = 9 hours which, when converted to minutes is 9*60 = 540 minutes He reads 150 minutes in the morning and 120 minutes in the evenings and 540 over the weekend for a total of 150+120+540 = 810 minutes in 1 week The answer is 810.\n\n\nQ: John adopts a dog from a shelter.  The dog ends up having health problems and this requires 3 vet appointments,  which cost $400 each.  After the first appointment, John paid $100 for pet insurance that covers 80% of the subsequent visits.  How much did he pay in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. He got a discount of 400*.8=$<<400*.8=320>>320 He got that discount for 3-1=<<3-1=2>>2 visits So each of those visits cost 400-320=$<<400-320=80>>80 So he paid 2*80=$<<2*80=160>>160 for those visits That means he paid a total of 400+160+100=$<<400+160+100=660>>660 The answer is 660.\n\n\nQ: Aimee does a poll around her neighborhood and makes sure to get answers from 50% men and 50% women. She finds that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. How many people did she poll?\nA: Let's think step by step. 65% of women are opposed to the idea because 100 - 35 = <<100-35=65>>65 There are 60 women in the poll because 39 / .65 = <<39/.65=60>>60 There were 120 people in her poll because 60 / .5 = <<60/.5=120>>120 The answer is 120.\n\n\n"
