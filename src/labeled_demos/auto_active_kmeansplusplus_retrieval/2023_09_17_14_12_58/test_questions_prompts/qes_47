  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Alyssa took 100 photos on vacation. She wants to put them in a photo album with 30 pages. She can place 3 photos each on the first 10 pages. Then she can place 4 photos each on the next 10 pages. If she wants to put an equal number of photos on each of the remaining pages of the album, how many photos can she place on each page?\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 3 x 10 = <<3*10=30>>30 photos in total that can be placed in the first 10 pages. There are 4 x 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 photos in total that can be placed in the next 10 pages. A total of 10 + 10 = <<10+10=20>>20 pages of the album have been used. A total of 30 + 40 = <<30+40=70>>70 photos can be placed on those 20 pages. So there are still 100 - 70 = <<100-70=30>>30 photos left to be placed on the album. And there are 30 - 20 = <<30-20=10>>10 pages left in the album. Therefore, 30/10 = <<30/10=3>>3 photos can be placed on each of the pages. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Bertha wears out 20 / 10 = <<20/10=2>>2 tennis balls in 20 games. She loses 20 / 5 = <<20/5=4>>4 tennis balls in 20 games. She buys canisters of 3 * 20 / 4 = <<3*20/4=15>>15 tennis balls in 20 games. Bertha started with 2 balls and gave 1 away, so she has 2 + 15 - 2 - 4 - 1 = <<2+15-2-4-1=10>>10 tennis balls after twenty games. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Timmy, Tommy and Tina are filling up a kiddie pool in their backyard.  Each has a pail they fill with water from a house before dumping it into the pool.  If Timmy's pail holds twice as much water as Tommy's, and Tommy's holds 2 gallons more than Tina's, and Tina's is 4 gallons, how much water do the three of them fill the pool with after 3 trips each?\nA: Let's think step by step. If Tina's pail holds 4 gallons and Tommy's holds 2 more gallons than hers, that means Tommy's holds 4+2=<<4+2=6>>6 gallons. If Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's 6-gallon pail, that means it holds 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 gallons. Therefore, in 1 trip that means all three move a total of 4+6+12=<<4+6+12=22>>22 gallons. In three trips, that means they would move a total of 22*3=<<22*3=66>>66 gallons The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: Madeline has 5 boxes with 24 crayons in each. She noticed that 5/8 of the crayons in the 2 boxes were not yet used. In the 2 other boxes, only 2/3 of the crayons were used while the last box was not entirely used. How many unused crayons did Madeline have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Two boxes of crayons have 24 x 5/8 = <<24*5/8=15>>15 unused crayons from each box. So, a total of 15 x 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 unused crayons are in the two boxes. For the other 2 boxes, there are 24 x 2/3 = <<24*2/3=16>>16 used crayons from each box. Hence, there are 24 - 16 = <<24-16=8>>8 unused crayons. So, a total of 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 unused crayons are in the other two boxes. Therefore, Madeline has a total of 30 + 16 + 24 = <<30+16+24=70>>70 unused crayons. The answer is 70.\n\n\nQ: Selina is selling some of her old clothes to a second-hand store. They will buy her pants for $5 each, her shorts for $3 each, and her shirts for $4 each. She sells 3 pairs of pants, 5 pairs of shorts, and some shirts. After she gets her money, she sees 2 shirts that she likes which cost $10 each and buys them. She leaves the store with $30. How many shirts did she sell to the store?\nA: Let's think step by step. The shirts she bought cost her $20 because 2 x 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 She earned $50 selling her clothes because 20 + 30 = <<20+30=50>>50 She made $15 off pants because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 She made 15 dollars from shorts because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 She made $20 off shirts because 50 - 15 - 15 = <<50-15-15=20>>20 She sold 5 shirts because 20 / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Jill makes scented candles as a hobby. Her favorite scents are lavender, coconut, and almond, and she uses the same amount of each scent for every candle. This time, she made twice as many lavender candles as coconut candles, along with a batch of almond candles. She ran out of almond scent after making ten candles. If she had one and a half times as much coconut scent as almond scent and used all her coconut scent up too, how many lavender candles did she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. Jill made one and a half times as many coconut candles as almond candles, so she made 10 * 1 1/2 = 15 coconut candles. She made twice as many lavender candles as coconut candles, so she made 2 * 15 = <<2*15=30>>30 lavender candles. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: At the duck park, there are 25 mallard ducks and ten less than twice as many geese as ducks.  Then, a small flock of 4 ducks arrived at the park and joined the birds already there.  If five less than 15 geese leave the park, how many more geese than ducks remain at the park?\nA: Let's think step by step. Initially, twice as many geese as ducks is 25*2=<<25*2=50>>50 geese. Therefore, ten less than twice as many geese as ducks is 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 geese. Then, 4 ducks arrived at the park, resulting in 25+4=<<4+25=29>>29 ducks. Five less than 15 geese is 15-5=<<15-5=10>>10 geese. Thus, if 5 less than 15 geese leave, then 40-10=30 geese remain. Thus, there are 30-29=<<30-29=1>>1 more geese than ducks remaining at the park. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. 20% of her 40 students will bring their own life vest so .20*40 = <<.20*40=8>>8 students will bring their life vests Alice has 20 life vests and 8 students will bring there's so that's 20+8 = <<20+8=28>>28 life vests There are 40 students and 10 instructors total so that's 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 people in the class If there are 28 life vests and she has 50 people then she needs to find 50-28 = 22 more life vests The answer is 22.\n\n\n"
