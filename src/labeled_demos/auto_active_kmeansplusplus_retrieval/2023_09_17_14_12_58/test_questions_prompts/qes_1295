  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Logan makes $65,000 a year. He spends $20,000 on rent every year, $5000 on groceries every year, and $8000 on gas every year. If he wants to have at least $42000 left, how much more money must he make each year?\nA: Let's think step by step. Logan spends 20000+5000+8000 = <<20000+5000+8000=33000>>33000 a year. Logan has 65000-33000 = <<65000-33000=32000>>32000 left a year. Logan needs to make 42000-32000 = <<42000-32000=10000>>10000 more a year. The answer is 10000.\n\n\nQ: Gwen received a $900 bonus at work and decided to invest this money in the stock market.  She spent one-third of her bonus on stock A, one-third on stock B, and the remaining one-third on stock C.   After one year, stock A and stock B had doubled in value, while stock C had lost half of its value.  At the end of the year, how much were Gwen's stocks worth, in dollars?\nA: Let's think step by step. One-third of her bonus was $900/3 = $<<900/3=300>>300. After one year, stock A doubled in value and was worth $300*2 = $<<300*2=600>>600. After one year, stock B doubled in value and was worth $300*2 = $<<300*2=600>>600. After one year, stock C had lost half its value and was worth $300/2 = $<<300/2=150>>150. Altogether, at the end of the year, Gwen's stocks were worth $600+$600+$150 = $<<600+600+150=1350>>1350 The answer is 1350.\n\n\nQ: Steve has a bank account that earns 10% interest every year. He puts $100 in it, and then 10 each year. How much money is in it after two years?\nA: Let's think step by step. After one year it earns $10 in interest because 100 x .1 = <<100*.1=10>>10 It has $120 in it after a year because 100 + 10 + 10 = <<100+10+10=120>>120 In the second year it earns $12 in interest because 120 x .1 = <<120*.1=12>>12 In the second year it has $142 in it because 120 + 12 + 10 = <<120+12+10=142>>142 The answer is 142.\n\n\nQ: Selina is selling some of her old clothes to a second-hand store. They will buy her pants for $5 each, her shorts for $3 each, and her shirts for $4 each. She sells 3 pairs of pants, 5 pairs of shorts, and some shirts. After she gets her money, she sees 2 shirts that she likes which cost $10 each and buys them. She leaves the store with $30. How many shirts did she sell to the store?\nA: Let's think step by step. The shirts she bought cost her $20 because 2 x 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 She earned $50 selling her clothes because 20 + 30 = <<20+30=50>>50 She made $15 off pants because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 She made 15 dollars from shorts because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 She made $20 off shirts because 50 - 15 - 15 = <<50-15-15=20>>20 She sold 5 shirts because 20 / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Dorothy is 15 years old and wants to go to a museum with her family. Her family consists of her, her younger brother, her parents, and her grandfather. The regular ticket cost is $10. People 18 years old or younger have a discount of 30%. How much money will Dorothy have after this trip, when she currently has $70?\nA: Let's think step by step. The discount per one ticket is 10 * 30/100 = $<<10*30/100=3>>3. So Dorothy's and her brother's tickets are cheaper by 2 * 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6. Her family consists of 5 people, so the ticket cost stands at 5 * 10 = $<<5*10=50>>50. Including the discount will lower the price to 50 - 6 = $<<50-6=44>>44 in total. Dorothy will be left with 70 - 44 = $<<70-44=26>>26. The answer is 26.\n\n\nQ: Ryan works in an office that has an even number of men and women working there.  Ryan participates in a meeting composed of 4 men and 6 women who are pulled from the office floor.   This reduces the number of women working on the office floor by 20%.  How many people work at Ryan's office?\nA: Let's think step by step. Since 6 women are 20% of the total number of women working there, that means there are 6*5= <<6*5=30>>30 women working there in total. Since there are an even number of women and men working in the office, that means there are 30*2= <<30*2=60>>60 people working there in total, since there are 2 sexes. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: The ratio of the amount of money Cara, Janet, and Jerry have is 4:5:6. If the total amount of money they have is $75, calculate the loss Cara and Janet will make if they combine their money to buy oranges and sell them at 80% of the buying price.\nA: Let's think step by step. The sum of the ratios representing the amount of money the three has is 4+5+6=<<4+5+6=15>>15 If the total amount of money they have is $75, the amount of money Cara has represented by the fraction 4/15 is 4/15*$75=$<<4/15*75=20>>20 Similarly, the amount of money Janet has represented by the fraction 5/15 of the total ratio is 5/15*$75=$<<5/15*75=25>>25 Combined, Cara and Janet have $20+25=$<<20+25=45>>45 If Cara and Janet buy goods worth $45 and sells them at 80% of the buying price, the selling price of the goods will be 80/100*$45=$<<45*80/100=36>>36 Since they bought the goods at $45 and sold them at $36, Janet and Cara would run at a loss of $45-$36=$<<45-36=9>>9 The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Janice can type 6 sentences per minute. Today at work, Janice continued working on a paper she started typing yesterday. She typed for 20 minutes, took a break, and typed 15 minutes longer. She then had to erase 40 sentences she had typed incorrectly. After a meeting, she typed for 18 minutes more. In all, the paper had 536 sentences by the end of today. How many sentences did she start with today?\nA: Let's think step by step. Janice had X sentences from yesterday already typed to start with today. Janice typed 6 * 20 = <<6*20=120>>120 sentences before her break. She typed 6 * 15 = <<6*15=90>>90 sentences after her break. She typed 6 * 18 = <<6*18=108>>108 sentences after her meeting. Therefore, she typed 120 + 90 + 108 = <<120+90+108=318>>318 sentences today in all. She had to erase 40 sentences, so she had 318 - 40 = <<318-40=278>>278 sentences that she typed today left. The paper had X + 278 = 536 sentences at the end of today. Thus, she had X = 536 - 278 = <<536-278=258>>258 sentences typed on the paper to start with today. The answer is 258.\n\n\n"
