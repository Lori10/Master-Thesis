  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Michael has two brothers. His oldest brother is 1 year older than twice Michael's age when Michael was a year younger. His younger brother is 5 years old, which is a third of the age of the older brother. What is their combined age?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe oldest brother is 15 because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15\nMichael is 8 because if 1 + (Michael's age - 1) x 2 = 15 then Michael's age = 8\nTheir combined age is 28 because 5 + 15 + 8 = <<5+15+8=28>>28 The answer is 28.\n\n\nQ: Tricia is a third of Amilia\u2019s age and Amilia is a quarter of Yorick\u2019s age. Yorick is twice Eugene\u2019s age and Khloe is a third of Eugene\u2019s age. Rupert is 10 years older than Khloe but 2 years younger than Vincent who is 22 years old. How old, in years, is Tricia?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nRupert is younger than Vincent by 2 years, so he is 22 years old \u2013 2 years = <<22-2=20>>20 years old.\nKhloe is 10 years younger than Rupert so she is 20 years old \u2013 10 years = 10 years old.\nEugene is 3 times older than Khloe so he is 10 years old * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 years old.\nYorick is twice Eugene\u2019s age so he is 30 years old * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 years old.\nAmilia is a quarter of Yorick\u2019s age so she is 60 years old / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 years old.\nTricia is a third of Amilia\u2019s age so she is 15 years old / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 years old. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Carlos and Diego are racing around the block. Carlos runs around the entire block in 3 minutes. Diego runs around half the block in 2.5 minutes and then is tripped by a dog and can't finish. Assuming he kept up the same speed the entire race, what would've been the average time in seconds for the racers?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nIf he finished the race, it would've taken 5 minutes because 2.5 x 2 = <<2.5*2=5>>5\nTheir total time would've been 8 minutes because 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8\nThe average would've been 4 minutes because 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4\nThe average time in seconds would've been 240 because 4 x 60 = <<4*60=240>>240 The answer is 240.\n\n\n"
