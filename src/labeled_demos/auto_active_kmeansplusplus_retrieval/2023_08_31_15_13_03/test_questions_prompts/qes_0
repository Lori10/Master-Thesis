  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Hazel put up a lemonade stand. She sold half her lemonade to a construction crew. She sold 18 cups to kids on bikes. She gave away half that amount to her friends. Then she drank the last cup of lemonade herself. How many cups of lemonade did Hazel make?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nHazel sold 18 cups of lemonade to kids on bikes and gave half that amount, or 18 / 2 = <<18/2=9>>9 cups, away to friends.\nHazel sold 18 cups + gave away 9 cups + drank 1 cup = <<18+9+1=28>>28 cups.\nSince Hazel sold half her lemonade to a construction crew, that means the 28 cups she sold to kids on bikes, gave away to friends and drank herself are the other half, so she sold 28 cups to the construction crew.\nIn all, Hazel sold 28 + 28 = <<28+28=56>>56 cups of lemonade. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nBertha wears out 20 / 10 = <<20/10=2>>2 tennis balls in 20 games.\nShe loses 20 / 5 = <<20/5=4>>4 tennis balls in 20 games.\nShe buys canisters of 3 * 20 / 4 = <<3*20/4=15>>15 tennis balls in 20 games.\nBertha started with 2 balls and gave 1 away, so she has 2 + 15 - 2 - 4 - 1 = <<2+15-2-4-1=10>>10 tennis balls after twenty games. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Michael has two brothers. His oldest brother is 1 year older than twice Michael's age when Michael was a year younger. His younger brother is 5 years old, which is a third of the age of the older brother. What is their combined age?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe oldest brother is 15 because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15\nMichael is 8 because if 1 + (Michael's age - 1) x 2 = 15 then Michael's age = 8\nTheir combined age is 28 because 5 + 15 + 8 = <<5+15+8=28>>28 The answer is 28.\n\n\n"
