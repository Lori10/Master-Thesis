  "test_question": "Q: John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week.  He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs.  How fast does he run?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Carlos and Diego are racing around the block. Carlos runs around the entire block in 3 minutes. Diego runs around half the block in 2.5 minutes and then is tripped by a dog and can't finish. Assuming he kept up the same speed the entire race, what would've been the average time in seconds for the racers?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nIf he finished the race, it would've taken 5 minutes because 2.5 x 2 = <<2.5*2=5>>5\nTheir total time would've been 8 minutes because 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8\nThe average would've been 4 minutes because 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4\nThe average time in seconds would've been 240 because 4 x 60 = <<4*60=240>>240 The answer is 240.\n\n\nQ: Michael has two brothers. His oldest brother is 1 year older than twice Michael's age when Michael was a year younger. His younger brother is 5 years old, which is a third of the age of the older brother. What is their combined age?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe oldest brother is 15 because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15\nMichael is 8 because if 1 + (Michael's age - 1) x 2 = 15 then Michael's age = 8\nTheir combined age is 28 because 5 + 15 + 8 = <<5+15+8=28>>28 The answer is 28.\n\n\nQ: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nBertha wears out 20 / 10 = <<20/10=2>>2 tennis balls in 20 games.\nShe loses 20 / 5 = <<20/5=4>>4 tennis balls in 20 games.\nShe buys canisters of 3 * 20 / 4 = <<3*20/4=15>>15 tennis balls in 20 games.\nBertha started with 2 balls and gave 1 away, so she has 2 + 15 - 2 - 4 - 1 = <<2+15-2-4-1=10>>10 tennis balls after twenty games. The answer is 10.\n\n\n"
