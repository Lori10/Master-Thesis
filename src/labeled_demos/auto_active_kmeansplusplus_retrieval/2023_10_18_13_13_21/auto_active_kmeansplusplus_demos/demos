            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. First, we can simplify the second ratio by cross-multiplying to get z(y + x) = (y)(y + x), which simplifies to y^2 = zx. Next, we can substitute this expression for y^2 into the first ratio to get y/(x - z) = (y + x)/z = x/zx^(1/2). Simplifying this expression, we get y = x^(3/2)/(x - z) and z = x^(1/2)/(x - z). Now, we can substitute these expressions for y and z into the ratio y^2 : x : z to get x^(3/2)/(x - z)^2 : x : x^(1/2)/(x - z). Simplifying this expression, we get x^(5/2) : x(x - z)^2 : x^(3/2)(x - z). Cancelling out an x from each term, we get x^(3/2) : (x - z)^2 : x^(1/2). Now, we can substitute the expression for z from earlier (z = x^(1/2)/(x - z)) into this ratio to get x^(3/2) : (x - x^(1/2))^2 : x^(1/2). Simplifying this expression, we get x^(3/2) : (x^2 - 2x^(3/2) + x) : x^(1/2). Finally, we can simplify the middle term by expanding the square and combining like terms to get x^(3/2) : (x^2 - 2x^(3/2) + x) : x^(1/2) = x^(3/2) : (x^2 - x^(3/2)) : x^(1/2) = x^(1/2) : (x - 1) : 1. Therefore, the answer is (E) none of these, since none of the given answer choices match the ratio x^(1/2) : (x - 1) : 1.",

In 2 hours, the pump fills the entire tank, but during this time the leak also drains some water. Let's say the leak drains 1/2 of the tank in 2 hours. So, in 2 hours, the pump fills 1/2 of the tank and the leak drains 1/2 of the tank. This means that the net amount of water added to the tank in 2 hours is 0. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 1/2 - 1/x = 0 Solving for x, we get: 1/x = 1/2 x = 2 Therefore, the leak can drain the entire tank in 2 hours. The correct answer is (A) 4 hours.

The area of the courtyard is given by multiplying its length and width: Area = 3.78 x 5.95 = 22.545 square meters Let's assume that each tile has a side length of x meters. Then the number of tiles needed to cover the courtyard can be found by dividing the area of the courtyard by the area of each tile: Number of tiles = Area of courtyard / Area of each tile Number of tiles = 22.545 / x^2 For the largest size of the tile, we want to minimize the number of tiles needed. This means we want to maximize the size of each tile. To maximize the size of each tile, we need to minimize the number of tiles. The number of tiles is minimized when each tile is as large as possible. So, we need to find the largest perfect square that is a factor of 22.545. 22.545 = 3 x 3 x 2.505 The largest perfect square that is a factor of 22.545 is 9.

Finally, we know that Ayush's mother is 22 years older than Ayush. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 5 = 10 + 22 Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 27 Therefore, the father got married at age 27 - 2 = 25 years old. The correct answer is (D) 25 years.",

The provision of food for 150 men for 60 days means that the fort has food for 150 x 60 = 9000 man-days. Step 2: Find the amount of food consumed in the first 10 days. Since there were 150 men in the fort for the first 10 days, the amount of food consumed in the first 10 days is 150 x 10 = 1500 man-days. Step 3: Find the amount of food remaining after 10 days. The amount of food remaining after 10 days is 9000 - 1500 = 7500 man-days. Step 4: Find the number of men remaining in the fort. After 25 men left the fort, the number of men remaining in the fort is 150 - 25 = 125. Step 5: Find the number of days for which the remaining food will last. Let's assume that the remaining food will last for x days. Since the same amount of food is now available for 125 men, the amount of food required for x days is 125x man-days. We know that this amount of food is equal to the remaining food in the fort, which is 7500 man-days.

We know that for every 2 ounces of butter, 5 cups of flour are used. So, we can write: 2/5 = 8/x where x is the number of cups of flour needed for the new recipe.

The vertex of a quadratic equation in the form of h = a(t-b)^2 + c is (b, c). In this case, the vertex is (2, 150). This means that the object reaches its maximum height of 150 feet after 2 seconds. Next, we need to find the height of the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height. We can do this by plugging in t = 4 (2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height) into the equation h = -15(t-2)^2 + 150. h = -15(4-2)^2 + 150 h = -15(2)^2 + 150 h = -60 + 150 h = 90 Therefore, the height of the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height is 90 feet.

If the merchant sells the sweater at a 60% discount, he sells it for 40% of the original price, which is $40. Now, we know that the merchant makes a 20% profit on the wholesale cost at which he initially purchased the item. So, the cost price for the merchant is $100, and he makes a profit of 20%, which is $20. Therefore, the selling price for the merchant is $120. We can now calculate the markup percentage from the wholesale price to the normal retail price. Markup percentage = (Selling price - Wholesale price) / Wholesale price x 100% Markup percentage = ($120 - $100) / $100 x 100% Markup percentage = 20% Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 20%.",

Now, we can find the total salary of the remaining workers by subtracting the total salary of the technicians from the total salary of all workers: Total salary of remaining workers = 850x - 7000. We also know that the average salary/head of the remaining workers is Rs. 780. So, we can set up an equation: (850x - 7000) / (x - 7) = 780 Solving for x, we get x = 22.

The product of these primes is 33, which is greater than the square root of 99 (which is approximately 9.95). Therefore, 99 is not prime saturated. Let's try 97. 97 is a prime number, so its only prime factor is itself. The product of this prime is 97, which is less than the square root of 97 (which is approximately 9.85). Therefore, 97 is prime saturated. Let's try 96. The prime factors of 96 are 2, 3, and 5. The product of these primes is 30, which is less than the square root of 96 (which is approximately 9.8). Therefore, 96 is prime saturated. Let's try 95. The prime factors of 95 are 5 and 19. The product of these primes is 95, which is equal to the square root of 95. Therefore, 95 is not prime saturated. Therefore, the greatest prime saturated two-digit integer is 98, which is option (B).",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that there are 100 passengers on the ship. 40% of the passengers held round-trip tickets and took their cars abroad the ship, which means there are 40 passengers who fit this description. Now, we know that 50% of the passengers with round-trip tickets did not take their cars abroad the ship. So, out of the 40 passengers with round-trip tickets, 50% did not take their cars, which means 20 passengers did not take their cars. Therefore, the remaining 20 passengers with round-trip tickets did take their cars abroad the ship. To find the percentage of passengers with round-trip tickets, we divide the total number of passengers (100) into the number of passengers with round-trip tickets (40). 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%. So, the answer is (A) 40%.",

So, the probability of getting 4 consecutive tails in 5 throws can be calculated as follows: Probability = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/32 However, we need to take into account that A has already gotten a tail in the first throw. So, we only need to consider the probability of getting 3 consecutive tails in the next 4 throws.

The prime factorization of 144 is 2^4 * 3^2. The prime factorization of 368 is 2^4 * 23. The GCD of these three numbers is 12 (2^2 * 3).

The total amount earned from selling all 300 oranges would be $12.10.
