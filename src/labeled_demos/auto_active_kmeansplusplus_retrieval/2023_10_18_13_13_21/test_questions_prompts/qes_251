  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In a game, a person is declared winner, if he gets 4 consecutive tails in five throws of a coin. What is the probability of A to win if he has got a tail in the first throw? Answer Choices: (A) 1/5 (B) 1/4 (C) 1/8 (D) 1/16 (E) 1/6\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that A has already gotten a tail in the first throw. Now, in order to win, A needs to get 3 more consecutive tails in the next 4 throws. The probability of getting a tail in any given throw is 1/2 (assuming a fair coin). So, the probability of getting 4 consecutive tails in 5 throws can be calculated as follows: Probability = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/32 However, we need to take into account that A has already gotten a tail in the first throw. So, we only need to consider the probability of getting 3 consecutive tails in the next 4 throws. Probability = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16 Therefore, the probability of A winning if he has already gotten a tail in the first throw is 1/16. The correct answer is (D) 1/16. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Richard has to paint a mural with seven horizontal stripes. He only has enough paint for four red stripes, four blue stripes, four white stripes. If his patron wants at most two different colors in the mural, how many different ways can he paint the wall? Answer Choices: (A) 210 (B) 350 (C) 700 (D) 2,520 (E) 5,040\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to consider the case where Richard uses only one color. He can choose any of the three colors, so there are 3 ways to paint the mural with only one color. Next, we need to consider the case where Richard uses two colors. He can choose any two colors out of the three, which can be done in 3C2 = 3 ways. For each choice of colors, he can paint the mural in the following ways: - 2 stripes of one color, 5 stripes of the other color: 4C2 x 4C5 = 6 x 4 = 24 - 3 stripes of one color, 4 stripes of the other color: 4C3 x 4C4 = 4 x 1 = 4 So, there are 3 x (24 + 4) = 84 ways to paint the mural with two colors. Therefore, the total number of ways to paint the mural is 3 + 84 = 87. None of the above answer choices match our answer, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Carmelo and LeBron participate in a seven-person footrace on the basketball court during All-Star Weekend. If all seven contestants finish (including Charles Barkley) and there are no ties, how many different arrangements of finishes are there in which Carmelo defeats LeBron? Answer Choices: (A)  5040 (B)  2520 (C)  720 (D)  120 (E)  42\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to choose the positions for Carmelo and LeBron. There are 2 options for the first place, and once that is decided, there is only 1 option for the second place. Next, we need to arrange the remaining 5 people in the remaining 5 positions. There are 5 options for the third place, 4 options for the fourth place, 3 options for the fifth place, 2 options for the sixth place, and 1 option for the seventh place. Therefore, the total number of arrangements in which Carmelo defeats LeBron is 2 x 1 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 240. None of the answer choices match our result, so the answer is None of the above. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In the third grade of Windblown School there are 96 students, one third of them failed the math test and 1/6 failed that literature test. At least how many students failed both tests? Answer Choices: (A) 0. (B) 6. (C) 8. (D) 10. (E) 12.\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of students who failed the math test. One third of the 96 students failed the math test, so: 1/3 x 96 = 32 Therefore, 32 students failed the math test. Step 2: Find the number of students who failed the literature test. 1/6 of the 96 students failed the literature test, so: 1/6 x 96 = 16 Therefore, 16 students failed the literature test. Step 3: Find the number of students who failed both tests. We don't know the exact number of students who failed both tests, but we do know that it must be less than or equal to the smaller of the two numbers we just found (i.e. 16). Therefore, the answer is (B) 6, because that is the only option that is less than or equal to 16. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
