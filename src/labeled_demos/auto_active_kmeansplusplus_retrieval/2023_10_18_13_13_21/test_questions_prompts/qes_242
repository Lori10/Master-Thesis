  "test_question": "Q: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? Answer Choices: (A) 277 (B) 288 (C) 200 (D) 277 (E) 168",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In the third grade of Windblown School there are 96 students, one third of them failed the math test and 1/6 failed that literature test. At least how many students failed both tests? Answer Choices: (A) 0. (B) 6. (C) 8. (D) 10. (E) 12.\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of students who failed the math test. One third of the 96 students failed the math test, so: 1/3 x 96 = 32 Therefore, 32 students failed the math test. Step 2: Find the number of students who failed the literature test. 1/6 of the 96 students failed the literature test, so: 1/6 x 96 = 16 Therefore, 16 students failed the literature test. Step 3: Find the number of students who failed both tests. We don't know the exact number of students who failed both tests, but we do know that it must be less than or equal to the smaller of the two numbers we just found (i.e. 16). Therefore, the answer is (B) 6, because that is the only option that is less than or equal to 16. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A club with a total membership of 25 has formed 3 committees, M, S and R, which have 8, 12 and 5 members respectively. If no members of committee M is on either of the other 2 committees, what is the greatest possible number of members in the club who are on none of the committees? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 7 (C) 8 (D) 10 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of members who are on the committees. M has 8 members, S has 12 members, and R has 5 members. Since no members of M are on either of the other 2 committees, we can subtract the 8 members of M from the total number of committee members: Total committee members = 8 + 12 + 5 - 8 = 17 So, there are 17 members on the committees. To find the greatest possible number of members who are on none of the committees, we need to subtract this number from the total membership of the club: Greatest possible number of members not on committees = 25 - 17 = 8 Therefore, the answer is (C) 8. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In what ratio mental A at Rs.68 per kg be mixed with another metal at Rs.96 per kg so that cost of alloy (mixture) is Rs.72 per kg? Answer Choices: (A) 6:1 (B) 4:7 (C) 3:7 (D) 9:5 (E) 9:8\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the ratio of mental A to the other metal be x:y. Then, the cost of 1 kg of the alloy is given by: (68x + 96y)/(x+y) = 72 Multiplying both sides by (x+y), we get: 68x + 96y = 72(x+y) Expanding and simplifying, we get: 4x = 3y So, the ratio of mental A to the other metal is 4:3. However, this is not one of the answer choices. We can try simplifying the ratio further by dividing both sides by 3: 4/3 : 1 Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: 4 : 3 So, the ratio of mental A to the other metal is 4:3, which is equivalent to option (None of the above). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A and B enter into partnership with capital as 7:9. At the end of 8 months, A withdraws. If they receive the profits in the ratio of 8:9 find how long B's capital was used? Answer Choices: (A) 7 months (B) 3 months (C) 5 months (D) 8 months (E) 10 months\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. Let's assume that A invested 7x and B invested 9x. Since A withdraws after 8 months, he has invested for only 8 months. B's capital was used for the entire duration of the partnership, which we need to find. Let's assume that B's capital was used for y months. Now, we can calculate the ratio of profits that A and B receive: Profit ratio = (7x * 8) : (9x * y) Profit ratio = 56x : 9xy We know that the profit ratio is 8:9, so we can set up an equation: 56x : 9xy = 8 : 9 Cross-multiplying, we get: 504x = 72xy Simplifying, we get: 7x = y Therefore, B's capital was used for 7 months. The answer is (A) 7 months. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
