  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A pump can fill a tank with water in 2 hours. Because of a leak, it took 2 hours to fill the tank. The leak can drain all the water of the tank in: Answer Choices: (A) 4 hours (B) 7 hours (C) 8 hours (D) 14 hours (E) 15 hours\nA: Let's think step by step. The pump can fill the tank in 2 hours, so in 1 hour it can fill 1/2 of the tank. Let's assume the leak can drain the entire tank in x hours. In 2 hours, the pump fills the entire tank, but during this time the leak also drains some water. Let's say the leak drains 1/2 of the tank in 2 hours. So, in 2 hours, the pump fills 1/2 of the tank and the leak drains 1/2 of the tank. This means that the net amount of water added to the tank in 2 hours is 0. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 1/2 - 1/x = 0 Solving for x, we get: 1/x = 1/2 x = 2 Therefore, the leak can drain the entire tank in 2 hours. The correct answer is (A) 4 hours. None of the given options match the correct answer. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 25 copies per minute. A second copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 55 copies per minute. Working together at their respective rates, how many copies do the two machines make in half an hour ? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 2,400 (C) 4,500 (D) 5,400 (E) 324,000\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the combined rate of the two machines. To do this, we add their individual rates: 25 copies/minute + 55 copies/minute = 80 copies/minute Next, we need to convert half an hour to minutes: 30 minutes Now we can use the formula: rate x time = amount Plugging in the values we have: 80 copies/minute x 30 minutes = 2400 copies Therefore, the answer is (B) 2,400. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A and B enter into partnership with capital as 7:9. At the end of 8 months, A withdraws. If they receive the profits in the ratio of 8:9 find how long B's capital was used? Answer Choices: (A) 7 months (B) 3 months (C) 5 months (D) 8 months (E) 10 months\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. Let's assume that A invested 7x and B invested 9x. Since A withdraws after 8 months, he has invested for only 8 months. B's capital was used for the entire duration of the partnership, which we need to find. Let's assume that B's capital was used for y months. Now, we can calculate the ratio of profits that A and B receive: Profit ratio = (7x * 8) : (9x * y) Profit ratio = 56x : 9xy We know that the profit ratio is 8:9, so we can set up an equation: 56x : 9xy = 8 : 9 Cross-multiplying, we get: 504x = 72xy Simplifying, we get: 7x = y Therefore, B's capital was used for 7 months. The answer is (A) 7 months. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Three friends-whose walking rates are 1 ft./sec., 3ft./sec.,and 6ft./sec. start together walking in the same direction around a circular track that is 420 feet in circumference.After how many minutes are the three of them together again? Answer Choices: (A) 5 mins (B) 10 mins (C) 15 mins (D) 3 mins (E) 7 mins\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for each friend to complete one full lap around the track. We can use the formula: time = distance / rate For the friend with a walking rate of 1 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 1 ft./sec. = 420 sec. For the friend with a walking rate of 3 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 3 ft./sec. = 140 sec. For the friend with a walking rate of 6 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 6 ft./sec. = 70 sec. Now we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these three times, which will give us the time it takes for all three friends to be together again. The LCM of 420 sec., 140 sec., and 70 sec. is 420 sec. Converting 420 sec. to minutes, we get: 420 sec. / 60 sec./min. = 7 min. Therefore, the answer is (E) 7 mins. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
