  "test_question": "Q: A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. What is the perimeter of the piece? Answer Choices: (A) 60 m (B) 61 m (C) 62 m (D) 63 m (E) 64 m",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: courtyard 3.78 meters long 5.95 meters wide is to be paved exactly with square tiles, all of the same size. what is the largest size of the tile which could be used for the purpose? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 77 (C) 877 (D) 99 (E) 88\nA: Let's think step by step. The area of the courtyard is given by multiplying its length and width: Area = 3.78 x 5.95 = 22.545 square meters Let's assume that each tile has a side length of x meters. Then the number of tiles needed to cover the courtyard can be found by dividing the area of the courtyard by the area of each tile: Number of tiles = Area of courtyard / Area of each tile Number of tiles = 22.545 / x^2 For the largest size of the tile, we want to minimize the number of tiles needed. This means we want to maximize the size of each tile. To maximize the size of each tile, we need to minimize the number of tiles. The number of tiles is minimized when each tile is as large as possible. So, we need to find the largest perfect square that is a factor of 22.545. 22.545 = 3 x 3 x 2.505 The largest perfect square that is a factor of 22.545 is 9. So, the largest size of the tile that could be used is the square root of 9, which is 3 meters. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: the perimeter of an equilateral triangle is 45.if one of the side is the side of an isoceles triangle of perimeter 40 then what is the lenght of base of isoceles triangle. Answer Choices: (A) 10 units (B) 20 units (C) 30 units (D) 40 units (E) 15 units\nA: Let's think step by step. The perimeter of an equilateral triangle is 45, which means each side is 15 units long. Now, we know that one of the sides of an isosceles triangle is also 15 units long. Let's call the length of the base of the isosceles triangle \"b\". Since the perimeter of the isosceles triangle is 40, we can set up an equation: 15 + 15 + b = 40 Simplifying this equation, we get: 30 + b = 40 Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: b = 10 Therefore, the length of the base of the isosceles triangle is 10 units. The correct answer is (A) 10 units. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A fort had provision of food for 150 men for 60 days. After 10 days, 25 men left the fort. The number of days for which the remaining food will last, is: Answer Choices: (A) 29 1/5 (B) 37 1/4 (C) 42 (D) 54 (E) 60\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total amount of food available in the fort. The provision of food for 150 men for 60 days means that the fort has food for 150 x 60 = 9000 man-days. Step 2: Find the amount of food consumed in the first 10 days. Since there were 150 men in the fort for the first 10 days, the amount of food consumed in the first 10 days is 150 x 10 = 1500 man-days. Step 3: Find the amount of food remaining after 10 days. The amount of food remaining after 10 days is 9000 - 1500 = 7500 man-days. Step 4: Find the number of men remaining in the fort. After 25 men left the fort, the number of men remaining in the fort is 150 - 25 = 125. Step 5: Find the number of days for which the remaining food will last. Let's assume that the remaining food will last for x days. Since the same amount of food is now available for 125 men, the amount of food required for x days is 125x man-days. We know that this amount of food is equal to the remaining food in the fort, which is 7500 man-days. Therefore, we can write the equation: 125x = 7500 Solving for x, we get: x = 60 Therefore, the remaining food will last for 60 days. Answer: (E) 60 The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Richard has to paint a mural with seven horizontal stripes. He only has enough paint for four red stripes, four blue stripes, four white stripes. If his patron wants at most two different colors in the mural, how many different ways can he paint the wall? Answer Choices: (A) 210 (B) 350 (C) 700 (D) 2,520 (E) 5,040\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to consider the case where Richard uses only one color. He can choose any of the three colors, so there are 3 ways to paint the mural with only one color. Next, we need to consider the case where Richard uses two colors. He can choose any two colors out of the three, which can be done in 3C2 = 3 ways. For each choice of colors, he can paint the mural in the following ways: - 2 stripes of one color, 5 stripes of the other color: 4C2 x 4C5 = 6 x 4 = 24 - 3 stripes of one color, 4 stripes of the other color: 4C3 x 4C4 = 4 x 1 = 4 So, there are 3 x (24 + 4) = 84 ways to paint the mural with two colors. Therefore, the total number of ways to paint the mural is 3 + 84 = 87. None of the above answer choices match our answer, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
