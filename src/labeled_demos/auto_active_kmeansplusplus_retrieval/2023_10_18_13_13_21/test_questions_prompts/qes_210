  "test_question": "Q: Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity? Answer Choices: (A) $5102 (B) $618 (C) $216 (D) $202 (E) $200",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If $10,000 is invested at x percent simple annual interest for n years, which of the following represents the total amount of interest, in dollars, that will be earned by this investment in the n years? Answer Choices: (A) 10,000(x^n)  (B) 10,000(x/100) ^n (C) 10,000n(x/100)  (D) 10,000(1+x/100) ^n (E) 10,000n(1+x/100) \nA: Let's think step by step. The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time In this case, the principal is $10,000, the rate is x percent (which we need to convert to a decimal by dividing by 100), and the time is n years. So, the total amount of interest earned in n years is: Interest = 10,000 * (x/100) * n Simplifying this expression, we get: Interest = 100 * x * n Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 10,000n(x/100). The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: What annual payment dischargea debit of Rs.12900, due in 4yrs.At 5% rate? Answer Choices: (A) 2300 (B) 2400 (C) 3000 (D) 3500 (E) 3600\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the formula for the present value of an annuity to solve this problem. The formula is: PV = A * (1 - (1 + r)^(-n)) / r where PV is the present value of the annuity, A is the annual payment, r is the interest rate per period, and n is the number of periods. In this case, we know that PV = Rs. 12900, r = 5% per year, and n = 4 years. We want to solve for A. Plugging in the values, we get: 12900 = A * (1 - (1 + 0.05)^(-4)) / 0.05 Simplifying the right-hand side, we get: 12900 = A * (1 - 0.8227) 12900 = A * 0.1773 A = 12900 / 0.1773 A = 72877.5 However, this is the total amount that would discharge the debt in one payment. We want to know the annual payment, so we need to divide by the number of years: Annual payment = 72877.5 / 4 Annual payment = 18219.375 None of the answer choices match this result, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The average price of an antique car increases over the years. If from 1990 to 1996, the price of the car increased by 13% and from 1996 to 2001 it increased by 20%, what is the price of the car in 2001 if the price in 1990 was $11,500? Answer Choices: (A) $15,594. (B) $15,322. (C) $14,786. (D) $14,543. (E) $12,988.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the price of the car in 1996 after a 13% increase from 1990. Price in 1990 = $11,500 13% increase from 1990 = 0.13 x $11,500 = $1,495 Price in 1996 = $11,500 + $1,495 = $12,995 Next, we need to find the price of the car in 2001 after a 20% increase from 1996. 20% increase from 1996 = 0.20 x $12,995 = $2,599 Price in 2001 = $12,995 + $2,599 = $15,594 Therefore, the answer is (A) $15,594. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Peter has $642,986 in his savings account. What is the least amount of money (in whole number of dollars) that he must add to his account if he wants to split this money evenly among his nine children? Answer Choices: (A) $642,986 (B) $642,987 (C) $642,988 (D) $642,989 (E) $642,990\nA: Let's think step by step. Peter wants to split his savings evenly among his nine children. This means he needs to divide his savings by 9 to find out how much each child will get. $642,986 \u00f7 9 = $71,443.88 However, we need to add a whole number of dollars to his account, so we need to round up to the nearest dollar. $71,443.88 rounded up to the nearest dollar is $71,444. Therefore, Peter needs to add $71,444 to his savings account to split the money evenly among his nine children. The correct answer is (D) $642,989. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
