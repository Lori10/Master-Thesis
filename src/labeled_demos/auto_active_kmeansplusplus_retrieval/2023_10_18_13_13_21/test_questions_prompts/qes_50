  "formatted_prompt": "Q: An object thrown directly upward is at a height of h feet after t seconds, where h = -15 (t-2)^2 + 150. At what height, in feet, is the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 90 (C) 124 (D) 132 (E) 140\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the maximum height of the object. We can do this by finding the vertex of the quadratic equation h = -15(t-2)^2 + 150. The vertex of a quadratic equation in the form of h = a(t-b)^2 + c is (b, c). In this case, the vertex is (2, 150). This means that the object reaches its maximum height of 150 feet after 2 seconds. Next, we need to find the height of the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height. We can do this by plugging in t = 4 (2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height) into the equation h = -15(t-2)^2 + 150. h = -15(4-2)^2 + 150 h = -15(2)^2 + 150 h = -60 + 150 h = 90 Therefore, the height of the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height is 90 feet. The correct answer is (B) 90. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If y/(x - z) = (y + x)/z = x/y then find x : y : z ? Answer Choices: (A) 1 : 2 : 3 (B) 3 : 2 : 1 (C) 4 : 2 : 3 (D) 2 : 4 : 7 (E) none of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can simplify the second ratio by cross-multiplying to get z(y + x) = (y)(y + x), which simplifies to y^2 = zx. Next, we can substitute this expression for y^2 into the first ratio to get y/(x - z) = (y + x)/z = x/zx^(1/2). Simplifying this expression, we get y = x^(3/2)/(x - z) and z = x^(1/2)/(x - z). Now, we can substitute these expressions for y and z into the ratio y^2 : x : z to get x^(3/2)/(x - z)^2 : x : x^(1/2)/(x - z). Simplifying this expression, we get x^(5/2) : x(x - z)^2 : x^(3/2)(x - z). Cancelling out an x from each term, we get x^(3/2) : (x - z)^2 : x^(1/2). Now, we can substitute the expression for z from earlier (z = x^(1/2)/(x - z)) into this ratio to get x^(3/2) : (x - x^(1/2))^2 : x^(1/2). Simplifying this expression, we get x^(3/2) : (x^2 - 2x^(3/2) + x) : x^(1/2). Finally, we can simplify the middle term by expanding the square and combining like terms to get x^(3/2) : (x^2 - 2x^(3/2) + x) : x^(1/2) = x^(3/2) : (x^2 - x^(3/2)) : x^(1/2) = x^(1/2) : (x - 1) : 1. Therefore, the answer is (E) none of these, since none of the given answer choices match the ratio x^(1/2) : (x - 1) : 1. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Which of the following inequalities has a solution set, when graphed on the number line, is a single line segment of finite length? Answer Choices: (A) 2 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (B) 3 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (C) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (D) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (E) 4 <= 3x+4 <= 6\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to isolate the variable (x) in the inequality. We can do this by subtracting 4 from all parts of the inequality: (A) 2 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes -2 <= 3x <= 2 (B) 3 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes -1 <= 3x <= 2 (C) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes 1 <= 3x <= 2 (D) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes 1 <= 3x <= 2 (E) 4 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes 0 <= 3x <= 2 Now we can divide all parts of the inequality by 3: (A) -2/3 <= x <= 2/3 (B) -1/3 <= x <= 2/3 (C) 1/3 <= x <= 2/3 (D) 1/3 <= x <= 2/3 (E) 0 <= x <= 2/3 Option (C) has a solution set that is a single line segment of finite length, from x=1/3 to x=2/3. Therefore, the correct answer is (C). The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A batsman in his 17th innings makes a score of 85 and their by increasing his average by 3. What is his average after the 17thinnings? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 77 (C) 26 (D) 37 (E) 88\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the batsman's average before the 17th innings be x. So, the total runs scored by the batsman in his first 16 innings would be 16x. After the 17th innings, the total runs scored by the batsman would be (16x + 85). Now, we know that the batsman's average increased by 3 after the 17th innings. So, we can set up the equation: (16x + 85)/(17) = (x + 3) Solving for x, we get: x = 22 Therefore, the batsman's average after the 17th innings would be: (16x + 85)/(17) = (16*22 + 85)/(17) = 37 So, the correct answer is (D) 37. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
