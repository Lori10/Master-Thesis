  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 25 copies per minute. A second copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 55 copies per minute. Working together at their respective rates, how many copies do the two machines make in half an hour ? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 2,400 (C) 4,500 (D) 5,400 (E) 324,000\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the combined rate of the two machines. To do this, we add their individual rates: 25 copies/minute + 55 copies/minute = 80 copies/minute Next, we need to convert half an hour to minutes: 30 minutes Now we can use the formula: rate x time = amount Plugging in the values we have: 80 copies/minute x 30 minutes = 2400 copies Therefore, the answer is (B) 2,400. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Elena\u2019s bread recipe calls for 2 ounces of butter for each 5 cups of flour used. She needs to make 4 times the original recipe. If 12 ounces of butter is used, then how many cups of flour are needed? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 4 (C) 9 (D) 13 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much butter is needed for the new recipe. Since Elena needs to make 4 times the original recipe, she will need 4 x 2 = 8 ounces of butter. Next, we can set up a proportion to find out how much flour is needed. We know that for every 2 ounces of butter, 5 cups of flour are used. So, we can write: 2/5 = 8/x where x is the number of cups of flour needed for the new recipe. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 2x = 40 x = 20 Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In a game, a person is declared winner, if he gets 4 consecutive tails in five throws of a coin. What is the probability of A to win if he has got a tail in the first throw? Answer Choices: (A) 1/5 (B) 1/4 (C) 1/8 (D) 1/16 (E) 1/6\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that A has already gotten a tail in the first throw. Now, in order to win, A needs to get 3 more consecutive tails in the next 4 throws. The probability of getting a tail in any given throw is 1/2 (assuming a fair coin). So, the probability of getting 4 consecutive tails in 5 throws can be calculated as follows: Probability = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/32 However, we need to take into account that A has already gotten a tail in the first throw. So, we only need to consider the probability of getting 3 consecutive tails in the next 4 throws. Probability = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16 Therefore, the probability of A winning if he has already gotten a tail in the first throw is 1/16. The correct answer is (D) 1/16. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A woman sold 300 oranges at $12.10, some at the rate of 3 for 35 cents and the rest at 7 for 85 cents. How many were sold at the first rate? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 21 (C) 9 (D) 15 (E) 13\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. Let the number of oranges sold at the rate of 3 for 35 cents be x. Then, the number of oranges sold at the rate of 7 for 85 cents would be 300 - x. The total amount earned from selling x oranges at the rate of 3 for 35 cents would be (x/3) * 0.35 dollars. Similarly, the total amount earned from selling (300 - x) oranges at the rate of 7 for 85 cents would be (7/85) * (300 - x) dollars. The total amount earned from selling all 300 oranges would be $12.10. So, we can write the equation: (x/3) * 0.35 + (7/85) * (300 - x) = 12.10 Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 45 Therefore, the number of oranges sold at the rate of 3 for 35 cents is 45. Hence, the answer is (A) 45. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
