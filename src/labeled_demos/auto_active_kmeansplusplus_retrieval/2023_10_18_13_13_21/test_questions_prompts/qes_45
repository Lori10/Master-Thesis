  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 25 copies per minute. A second copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 55 copies per minute. Working together at their respective rates, how many copies do the two machines make in half an hour ? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 2,400 (C) 4,500 (D) 5,400 (E) 324,000\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the combined rate of the two machines. To do this, we add their individual rates: 25 copies/minute + 55 copies/minute = 80 copies/minute Next, we need to convert half an hour to minutes: 30 minutes Now we can use the formula: rate x time = amount Plugging in the values we have: 80 copies/minute x 30 minutes = 2400 copies Therefore, the answer is (B) 2,400. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Three friends-whose walking rates are 1 ft./sec., 3ft./sec.,and 6ft./sec. start together walking in the same direction around a circular track that is 420 feet in circumference.After how many minutes are the three of them together again? Answer Choices: (A) 5 mins (B) 10 mins (C) 15 mins (D) 3 mins (E) 7 mins\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for each friend to complete one full lap around the track. We can use the formula: time = distance / rate For the friend with a walking rate of 1 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 1 ft./sec. = 420 sec. For the friend with a walking rate of 3 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 3 ft./sec. = 140 sec. For the friend with a walking rate of 6 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 6 ft./sec. = 70 sec. Now we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these three times, which will give us the time it takes for all three friends to be together again. The LCM of 420 sec., 140 sec., and 70 sec. is 420 sec. Converting 420 sec. to minutes, we get: 420 sec. / 60 sec./min. = 7 min. Therefore, the answer is (E) 7 mins. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Carmelo and LeBron participate in a seven-person footrace on the basketball court during All-Star Weekend. If all seven contestants finish (including Charles Barkley) and there are no ties, how many different arrangements of finishes are there in which Carmelo defeats LeBron? Answer Choices: (A)  5040 (B)  2520 (C)  720 (D)  120 (E)  42\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to choose the positions for Carmelo and LeBron. There are 2 options for the first place, and once that is decided, there is only 1 option for the second place. Next, we need to arrange the remaining 5 people in the remaining 5 positions. There are 5 options for the third place, 4 options for the fourth place, 3 options for the fifth place, 2 options for the sixth place, and 1 option for the seventh place. Therefore, the total number of arrangements in which Carmelo defeats LeBron is 2 x 1 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 240. None of the answer choices match our result, so the answer is None of the above. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Jamboree and GMAT Club Contest Starts\nQUESTION #20:\nHow many words (with or without meaning) can be formed using all the letters of the word \u201cSELFIE\u201d so that the two E\u2019s are not together? Answer Choices: (A)  660 (B)  600 (C)  500 (D)  300 (E)  240\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of ways to arrange all the letters of the word \"SELFIE\". This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken all at a time, which is n!. In this case, n = 6, so the total number of arrangements is 6! = 720. Next, we need to subtract the number of arrangements where the two E's are together. To do this, we can treat the two E's as a single object and find the number of arrangements of the five objects \"S\", \"L\", \"F\", \"I\", and \"EE\". This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is nPr = n!/(n-r)!. In this case, n = 5 and r = 5, so the number of arrangements where the two E's are together is 5! = 120. Finally, we can subtract the number of arrangements where the two E's are together from the total number of arrangements to get the number of arrangements where the two E's are not together: 720 - 120 = 600. Therefore, the answer is (B) 600. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
