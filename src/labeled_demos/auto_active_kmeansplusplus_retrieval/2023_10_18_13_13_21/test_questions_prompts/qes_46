  "test_question": "Q: A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 240 (C) 30 (D) 60 (E) 120",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Three friends-whose walking rates are 1 ft./sec., 3ft./sec.,and 6ft./sec. start together walking in the same direction around a circular track that is 420 feet in circumference.After how many minutes are the three of them together again? Answer Choices: (A) 5 mins (B) 10 mins (C) 15 mins (D) 3 mins (E) 7 mins\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for each friend to complete one full lap around the track. We can use the formula: time = distance / rate For the friend with a walking rate of 1 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 1 ft./sec. = 420 sec. For the friend with a walking rate of 3 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 3 ft./sec. = 140 sec. For the friend with a walking rate of 6 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 6 ft./sec. = 70 sec. Now we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these three times, which will give us the time it takes for all three friends to be together again. The LCM of 420 sec., 140 sec., and 70 sec. is 420 sec. Converting 420 sec. to minutes, we get: 420 sec. / 60 sec./min. = 7 min. Therefore, the answer is (E) 7 mins. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 25 copies per minute. A second copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 55 copies per minute. Working together at their respective rates, how many copies do the two machines make in half an hour ? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 2,400 (C) 4,500 (D) 5,400 (E) 324,000\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the combined rate of the two machines. To do this, we add their individual rates: 25 copies/minute + 55 copies/minute = 80 copies/minute Next, we need to convert half an hour to minutes: 30 minutes Now we can use the formula: rate x time = amount Plugging in the values we have: 80 copies/minute x 30 minutes = 2400 copies Therefore, the answer is (B) 2,400. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Ricky likes to keep a spare tyre in his car every time. On a certain day, he travels 1, 00,000 km and just to make the most of all the tyres, he changes the tyres between his journey such that each tyre runs the same distance.\nWhat is the distance travelled by each tyre? Answer Choices: (A) 20000 (B) 35000 (C) 70000 (D) 60000 (E) 80000\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. Let's assume that Ricky has four tyres in total, including the spare tyre. Now, if he wants to make sure that each tyre runs the same distance, he needs to change the tyres after every 25% of the total distance travelled. So, 25% of 1,00,000 km is (25/100) x 1,00,000 = 25,000 km. Therefore, Ricky needs to change his tyres after every 25,000 km to ensure that each tyre runs the same distance. Hence, the distance travelled by each tyre is 25,000 km. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 20,000. (Note: The answer choices provided in the question are incorrect as none of them match the correct answer.) The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: In a certain province in France there are 11 cities. If a single road segment connects only two cities, how many road segments are required in order to connect the cities so that each city is connected to all other cities with a single road segment? Answer Choices: (A) 55 (B) 105 (C) 330 (D) 143 (E) 156\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. There are 11 cities in the province. We need to connect each city to all other cities with a single road segment. Let's start with one city. It needs to be connected to 10 other cities. Moving on to the next city, it also needs to be connected to 10 other cities. But we have already connected it to one city, so it needs to be connected to 9 more cities. Similarly, for the third city, it needs to be connected to 8 more cities. We can continue this pattern until we reach the last city, which needs to be connected to only one more city. So, the total number of road segments required would be: 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 55 Therefore, the answer is (A) 55. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
