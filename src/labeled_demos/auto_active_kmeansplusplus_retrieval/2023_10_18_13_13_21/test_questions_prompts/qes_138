  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A drink vendor has 60 liters of Maaza, 144 liters of Pepsi and 368 liters of Sprite. He wants to pack them in cans, so that each can contains the same number of liters of a drink, and doesn't want to mix any two drinks in a can. What is the least number of cans required? Answer Choices: (A) 135 (B) 137 (C) 143 (D) 310 (E) 380\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 60, 144, and 368 to determine the maximum number of liters that can be packed in a can. The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. The prime factorization of 144 is 2^4 * 3^2. The prime factorization of 368 is 2^4 * 23. The GCD of these three numbers is 12 (2^2 * 3). Therefore, each can can contain a maximum of 12 liters of a drink. To find the least number of cans required, we need to divide each quantity by 12 and round up to the nearest integer. 60/12 = 5 144/12 = 12 368/12 = 31 So we need at least 5 cans of Maaza, 12 cans of Pepsi, and 31 cans of Sprite. The total number of cans required is 5 + 12 + 31 = 48. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Salad dressing P is made up of 30% vinegar and 70% oil, and salad dressing Q contains 10% vinegar and 90% oil. If the two dressings are combined to produce a salad dressing that is 12% vinegar, dressing P comprises what percentage of the new dressing? Answer Choices: (A) 50% (B) 40% (C) 30% (D) 20% (E) 10%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that we have 100 ml of the new salad dressing. Let x be the percentage of dressing P in the new dressing. Then, we can write: - The amount of vinegar in dressing P = 30% of x ml - The amount of vinegar in dressing Q = 10% of (100 - x) ml (since the total amount of dressing is 100 ml and we have x ml of dressing P) - The amount of vinegar in the new dressing = 12% of 100 ml = 12 ml Since we are combining the two dressings, the total amount of vinegar in the new dressing is the sum of the amount of vinegar in dressing P and dressing Q. So, we can write: 0.3x + 0.1(100 - x) = 12 Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.2x + 10 = 12 0.2x = 2 x = 10 Therefore, dressing P comprises 10% of the new dressing. The correct answer is (E) 10%. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A woman sold 300 oranges at $12.10, some at the rate of 3 for 35 cents and the rest at 7 for 85 cents. How many were sold at the first rate? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 21 (C) 9 (D) 15 (E) 13\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. Let the number of oranges sold at the rate of 3 for 35 cents be x. Then, the number of oranges sold at the rate of 7 for 85 cents would be 300 - x. The total amount earned from selling x oranges at the rate of 3 for 35 cents would be (x/3) * 0.35 dollars. Similarly, the total amount earned from selling (300 - x) oranges at the rate of 7 for 85 cents would be (7/85) * (300 - x) dollars. The total amount earned from selling all 300 oranges would be $12.10. So, we can write the equation: (x/3) * 0.35 + (7/85) * (300 - x) = 12.10 Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 45 Therefore, the number of oranges sold at the rate of 3 for 35 cents is 45. Hence, the answer is (A) 45. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Elena\u2019s bread recipe calls for 2 ounces of butter for each 5 cups of flour used. She needs to make 4 times the original recipe. If 12 ounces of butter is used, then how many cups of flour are needed? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 4 (C) 9 (D) 13 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much butter is needed for the new recipe. Since Elena needs to make 4 times the original recipe, she will need 4 x 2 = 8 ounces of butter. Next, we can set up a proportion to find out how much flour is needed. We know that for every 2 ounces of butter, 5 cups of flour are used. So, we can write: 2/5 = 8/x where x is the number of cups of flour needed for the new recipe. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 2x = 40 x = 20 Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
