  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A bag of potatoes weighs 36 lbs divided by half of its weight. How much does the bag of potatoes weight? Answer Choices: (A) 20 lb (B) 30 lb (C) 10 lb (D) 15 lb (E) 36 lb\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find half of the weight of the bag of potatoes. We can represent this as 1/2x, where x is the weight of the bag of potatoes. Next, we know that the bag of potatoes weighs 36 lbs divided by half of its weight. We can represent this as: 36 = x/(1/2x) To simplify this equation, we can multiply both sides by 2x: 72x = x Now we can solve for x: 72x = x 71x = 0 x = 0 This doesn't make sense, as the weight of the bag of potatoes cannot be 0. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. Answer: None of the above. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: The average price of an antique car increases over the years. If from 1990 to 1996, the price of the car increased by 13% and from 1996 to 2001 it increased by 20%, what is the price of the car in 2001 if the price in 1990 was $11,500? Answer Choices: (A) $15,594. (B) $15,322. (C) $14,786. (D) $14,543. (E) $12,988.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the price of the car in 1996 after a 13% increase from 1990. Price in 1990 = $11,500 13% increase from 1990 = 0.13 x $11,500 = $1,495 Price in 1996 = $11,500 + $1,495 = $12,995 Next, we need to find the price of the car in 2001 after a 20% increase from 1996. 20% increase from 1996 = 0.20 x $12,995 = $2,599 Price in 2001 = $12,995 + $2,599 = $15,594 Therefore, the answer is (A) $15,594. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: On a certain transatlantic crossing, 40 percent of a ship\u2019s passengers held round-trip tickets and also took their cars abroad the ship. If 50 percent of the passengers with round-trip tickets did not take their cars abroad the ship, what percent of the ship\u2019s passengers held round-trip tickets? Answer Choices: (A) 40% (B) 50% (C) 60% (D) 80% (E) 90%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that there are 100 passengers on the ship. 40% of the passengers held round-trip tickets and took their cars abroad the ship, which means there are 40 passengers who fit this description. Now, we know that 50% of the passengers with round-trip tickets did not take their cars abroad the ship. So, out of the 40 passengers with round-trip tickets, 50% did not take their cars, which means 20 passengers did not take their cars. Therefore, the remaining 20 passengers with round-trip tickets did take their cars abroad the ship. To find the percentage of passengers with round-trip tickets, we divide the total number of passengers (100) into the number of passengers with round-trip tickets (40). 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%. So, the answer is (A) 40%. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The average salary/head of all the workers ina workshop is Rs.850, if the average salary/head of 7technician is Rs.1000 and the average salary/head of the rest is Rs.780, the total no. of workers in the work-shop is ? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 23 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the total number of workers in the workshop be x. We know that the average salary/head of all workers is Rs. 850. So, the total salary of all workers = 850x. We also know that the average salary/head of 7 technicians is Rs. 1000. So, the total salary of these 7 technicians = 1000 x 7 = 7000. Now, we can find the total salary of the remaining workers by subtracting the total salary of the technicians from the total salary of all workers: Total salary of remaining workers = 850x - 7000. We also know that the average salary/head of the remaining workers is Rs. 780. So, we can set up an equation: (850x - 7000) / (x - 7) = 780 Solving for x, we get x = 22. Therefore, the total number of workers in the workshop is 22. The answer is (C) 22. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
