  "test_question": "Q: Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.) Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Jamboree and GMAT Club Contest Starts\nQUESTION #20:\nHow many words (with or without meaning) can be formed using all the letters of the word \u201cSELFIE\u201d so that the two E\u2019s are not together? Answer Choices: (A)  660 (B)  600 (C)  500 (D)  300 (E)  240\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of ways to arrange all the letters of the word \"SELFIE\". This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken all at a time, which is n!. In this case, n = 6, so the total number of arrangements is 6! = 720. Next, we need to subtract the number of arrangements where the two E's are together. To do this, we can treat the two E's as a single object and find the number of arrangements of the five objects \"S\", \"L\", \"F\", \"I\", and \"EE\". This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is nPr = n!/(n-r)!. In this case, n = 5 and r = 5, so the number of arrangements where the two E's are together is 5! = 120. Finally, we can subtract the number of arrangements where the two E's are together from the total number of arrangements to get the number of arrangements where the two E's are not together: 720 - 120 = 600. Therefore, the answer is (B) 600. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Richard has to paint a mural with seven horizontal stripes. He only has enough paint for four red stripes, four blue stripes, four white stripes. If his patron wants at most two different colors in the mural, how many different ways can he paint the wall? Answer Choices: (A) 210 (B) 350 (C) 700 (D) 2,520 (E) 5,040\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to consider the case where Richard uses only one color. He can choose any of the three colors, so there are 3 ways to paint the mural with only one color. Next, we need to consider the case where Richard uses two colors. He can choose any two colors out of the three, which can be done in 3C2 = 3 ways. For each choice of colors, he can paint the mural in the following ways: - 2 stripes of one color, 5 stripes of the other color: 4C2 x 4C5 = 6 x 4 = 24 - 3 stripes of one color, 4 stripes of the other color: 4C3 x 4C4 = 4 x 1 = 4 So, there are 3 x (24 + 4) = 84 ways to paint the mural with two colors. Therefore, the total number of ways to paint the mural is 3 + 84 = 87. None of the above answer choices match our answer, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A club with a total membership of 25 has formed 3 committees, M, S and R, which have 8, 12 and 5 members respectively. If no members of committee M is on either of the other 2 committees, what is the greatest possible number of members in the club who are on none of the committees? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 7 (C) 8 (D) 10 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of members who are on the committees. M has 8 members, S has 12 members, and R has 5 members. Since no members of M are on either of the other 2 committees, we can subtract the 8 members of M from the total number of committee members: Total committee members = 8 + 12 + 5 - 8 = 17 So, there are 17 members on the committees. To find the greatest possible number of members who are on none of the committees, we need to subtract this number from the total membership of the club: Greatest possible number of members not on committees = 25 - 17 = 8 Therefore, the answer is (C) 8. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Find the odd man out. 187, 264, 316, 473, 682, 781 Answer Choices: (A) 187 (B) 316 (C) 781 (D) 682 (E) 473\nA: Let's think step by step. The numbers seem random, so we need to find a pattern or rule that applies to all except one of the numbers. If we look at the last digit of each number, we can see that they alternate between odd and even: 7, 4, 6, 3, 2, 1. However, this pattern doesn't apply to 316, which ends in an even digit. Therefore, the odd man out is (B) 316. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
