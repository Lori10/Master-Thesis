  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Elena\u2019s bread recipe calls for 2 ounces of butter for each 5 cups of flour used. She needs to make 4 times the original recipe. If 12 ounces of butter is used, then how many cups of flour are needed? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 4 (C) 9 (D) 13 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much butter is needed for the new recipe. Since Elena needs to make 4 times the original recipe, she will need 4 x 2 = 8 ounces of butter. Next, we can set up a proportion to find out how much flour is needed. We know that for every 2 ounces of butter, 5 cups of flour are used. So, we can write: 2/5 = 8/x where x is the number of cups of flour needed for the new recipe. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 2x = 40 x = 20 Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 25 copies per minute. A second copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 55 copies per minute. Working together at their respective rates, how many copies do the two machines make in half an hour ? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 2,400 (C) 4,500 (D) 5,400 (E) 324,000\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the combined rate of the two machines. To do this, we add their individual rates: 25 copies/minute + 55 copies/minute = 80 copies/minute Next, we need to convert half an hour to minutes: 30 minutes Now we can use the formula: rate x time = amount Plugging in the values we have: 80 copies/minute x 30 minutes = 2400 copies Therefore, the answer is (B) 2,400. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A woman sold 300 oranges at $12.10, some at the rate of 3 for 35 cents and the rest at 7 for 85 cents. How many were sold at the first rate? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 21 (C) 9 (D) 15 (E) 13\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. Let the number of oranges sold at the rate of 3 for 35 cents be x. Then, the number of oranges sold at the rate of 7 for 85 cents would be 300 - x. The total amount earned from selling x oranges at the rate of 3 for 35 cents would be (x/3) * 0.35 dollars. Similarly, the total amount earned from selling (300 - x) oranges at the rate of 7 for 85 cents would be (7/85) * (300 - x) dollars. The total amount earned from selling all 300 oranges would be $12.10. So, we can write the equation: (x/3) * 0.35 + (7/85) * (300 - x) = 12.10 Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 45 Therefore, the number of oranges sold at the rate of 3 for 35 cents is 45. Hence, the answer is (A) 45. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A fort had provision of food for 150 men for 60 days. After 10 days, 25 men left the fort. The number of days for which the remaining food will last, is: Answer Choices: (A) 29 1/5 (B) 37 1/4 (C) 42 (D) 54 (E) 60\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total amount of food available in the fort. The provision of food for 150 men for 60 days means that the fort has food for 150 x 60 = 9000 man-days. Step 2: Find the amount of food consumed in the first 10 days. Since there were 150 men in the fort for the first 10 days, the amount of food consumed in the first 10 days is 150 x 10 = 1500 man-days. Step 3: Find the amount of food remaining after 10 days. The amount of food remaining after 10 days is 9000 - 1500 = 7500 man-days. Step 4: Find the number of men remaining in the fort. After 25 men left the fort, the number of men remaining in the fort is 150 - 25 = 125. Step 5: Find the number of days for which the remaining food will last. Let's assume that the remaining food will last for x days. Since the same amount of food is now available for 125 men, the amount of food required for x days is 125x man-days. We know that this amount of food is equal to the remaining food in the fort, which is 7500 man-days. Therefore, we can write the equation: 125x = 7500 Solving for x, we get: x = 60 Therefore, the remaining food will last for 60 days. Answer: (E) 60 The answer is E.\n\n\n"
