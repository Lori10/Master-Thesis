The numbers seem random, so we need to find a pattern or rule that applies to all except one of the numbers. If we look at the last digit of each number, we can see that they alternate between odd and even: 7, 4, 6, 3, 2, 1. However, this pattern doesn't apply to 316, which ends in an even digit. Therefore, the odd man out is (B) 316. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A number is said to be prime saturated if the product of all the different positive prime factors of e is less than the square root of e. What is the greatest two digit prime saturated integer ? Answer Choices: (A) 99 (B) 98 (C) 97 (D) 96 (E) 95\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. First, we need to find all the prime factors of a number. Second, we need to find the product of all the different prime factors. Third, we need to compare this product with the square root of the number. Fourth, we need to repeat this process for all two-digit numbers and find the greatest prime saturated integer. Let's start with the first step. The prime numbers less than or equal to 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Any two-digit number that is not divisible by these primes is not prime saturated. Let's try 98. The prime factors of 98 are 2 and 7. The product of these primes is 14, which is less than the square root of 98 (which is approximately 9.9). Therefore, 98 is prime saturated. Let's try 99. The prime factors of 99 are 3 and 11. The product of these primes is 33, which is greater than the square root of 99 (which is approximately 9.95). Therefore, 99 is not prime saturated. Let's try 97. 97 is a prime number, so its only prime factor is itself. The product of this prime is 97, which is less than the square root of 97 (which is approximately 9.85). Therefore, 97 is prime saturated. Let's try 96. The prime factors of 96 are 2, 3, and 5. The product of these primes is 30, which is less than the square root of 96 (which is approximately 9.8). Therefore, 96 is prime saturated. Let's try 95. The prime factors of 95 are 5 and 19. The product of these primes is 95, which is equal to the square root of 95. Therefore, 95 is not prime saturated. Therefore, the greatest prime saturated two-digit integer is 98, which is option (B). The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: 69 laboratories raise the bacterium, the laboratory have 48 culture dishes on average, which has about 25,075 bacteria each. How many bacteria are there approximately? Answer Choices: (A) 10^7 (B) 10^8 (C) 10^9 (D) 10^10 (E) 10^11\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of culture dishes in all the laboratories. Total number of culture dishes = 69 x 48 = 3312 Step 2: Find the total number of bacteria in all the culture dishes. Total number of bacteria = 3312 x 25,075 = 83,076,000 Step 3: Convert the total number of bacteria into scientific notation. 83,076,000 = 8.3076 x 10^7 Therefore, the answer is (A) 10^7. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: what is summation of [3^k(28Ck)] (summation range 28 to k=0) where 28Ck is the number of ways of choosing k items from 28 items?? Answer Choices: (A) 4^28 (B) 4^27 (C) 4^26 (D) 4^25 (E) 4^24\nA: Let's think step by step. We can simplify the expression using the binomial theorem: (1 + 3)^28 = 28C0 * 3^0 + 28C1 * 3^1 + 28C2 * 3^2 + ... + 28C28 * 3^28 Notice that the expression we want to find is the same as the sum of the terms on the right-hand side of the equation above, except that we start the summation at k = 0 instead of k = 28. So we can write: summation of [3^k(28Ck)] (summation range 28 to k=0) = (1 + 3)^28 - 28C0 * 3^0 - 28C1 * 3^1 - 28C2 * 3^2 - ... - 28C27 * 3^27 We can simplify this expression by noticing that: (1 + 3)^28 = 4^28 And: 28C0 * 3^0 = 1 28C1 * 3^1 = 28 * 3 28C2 * 3^2 = 28 * 27 / 2 * 9 ... 28C27 * 3^27 = 28 * 27 * ... * 2 * 3^27 / 2^27 So we have: summation of [3^k(28Ck)] (summation range 28 to k=0) = 4^28 - 1 - 28 * 3 - 28 * 27 / 2 * 9 - ... - 28 * 27 * ... * 2 * 3^27 / 2^27 This expression can be simplified further, but we can already see that the answer is not any of the given options. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
