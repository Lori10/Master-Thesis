  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Gautami went to the stationers and bought things worth Rs. 100, out of which 50 paise went on sales tax on taxable purchases. If the tax rate was 5%. then what was the cost of the tax free items? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 99.50 (B) Rs. 70.50 (C) Rs. 89.50 (D) Rs. 69.50 (E) Rs. 80.50\nA: Let's think step by step. The total cost of the items including tax is Rs. 100. Out of this, 50 paise (or Rs. 0.50) went on sales tax. We know that the tax rate is 5%. So, we can set up an equation: 5% of the taxable purchases = Rs. 0.50 To find the cost of tax-free items, we need to subtract the tax amount from the total cost: Cost of tax-free items = Total cost - Tax amount Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 100 - Rs. 0.50 Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 99.50 Therefore, the answer is (A) Rs. 99.50. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: On a certain transatlantic crossing, 40 percent of a ship\u2019s passengers held round-trip tickets and also took their cars abroad the ship. If 50 percent of the passengers with round-trip tickets did not take their cars abroad the ship, what percent of the ship\u2019s passengers held round-trip tickets? Answer Choices: (A) 40% (B) 50% (C) 60% (D) 80% (E) 90%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that there are 100 passengers on the ship. 40% of the passengers held round-trip tickets and took their cars abroad the ship, which means there are 40 passengers who fit this description. Now, we know that 50% of the passengers with round-trip tickets did not take their cars abroad the ship. So, out of the 40 passengers with round-trip tickets, 50% did not take their cars, which means 20 passengers did not take their cars. Therefore, the remaining 20 passengers with round-trip tickets did take their cars abroad the ship. To find the percentage of passengers with round-trip tickets, we divide the total number of passengers (100) into the number of passengers with round-trip tickets (40). 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%. So, the answer is (A) 40%. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: In what ratio mental A at Rs.68 per kg be mixed with another metal at Rs.96 per kg so that cost of alloy (mixture) is Rs.72 per kg? Answer Choices: (A) 6:1 (B) 4:7 (C) 3:7 (D) 9:5 (E) 9:8\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the ratio of mental A to the other metal be x:y. Then, the cost of 1 kg of the alloy is given by: (68x + 96y)/(x+y) = 72 Multiplying both sides by (x+y), we get: 68x + 96y = 72(x+y) Expanding and simplifying, we get: 4x = 3y So, the ratio of mental A to the other metal is 4:3. However, this is not one of the answer choices. We can try simplifying the ratio further by dividing both sides by 3: 4/3 : 1 Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: 4 : 3 So, the ratio of mental A to the other metal is 4:3, which is equivalent to option (None of the above). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The average salary/head of all the workers ina workshop is Rs.850, if the average salary/head of 7technician is Rs.1000 and the average salary/head of the rest is Rs.780, the total no. of workers in the work-shop is ? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 23 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the total number of workers in the workshop be x. We know that the average salary/head of all workers is Rs. 850. So, the total salary of all workers = 850x. We also know that the average salary/head of 7 technicians is Rs. 1000. So, the total salary of these 7 technicians = 1000 x 7 = 7000. Now, we can find the total salary of the remaining workers by subtracting the total salary of the technicians from the total salary of all workers: Total salary of remaining workers = 850x - 7000. We also know that the average salary/head of the remaining workers is Rs. 780. So, we can set up an equation: (850x - 7000) / (x - 7) = 780 Solving for x, we get x = 22. Therefore, the total number of workers in the workshop is 22. The answer is (C) 22. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
