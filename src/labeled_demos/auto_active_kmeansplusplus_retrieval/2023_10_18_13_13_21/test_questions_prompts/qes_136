  "test_question": "Q: A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain? Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Ricky likes to keep a spare tyre in his car every time. On a certain day, he travels 1, 00,000 km and just to make the most of all the tyres, he changes the tyres between his journey such that each tyre runs the same distance.\nWhat is the distance travelled by each tyre? Answer Choices: (A) 20000 (B) 35000 (C) 70000 (D) 60000 (E) 80000\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. Let's assume that Ricky has four tyres in total, including the spare tyre. Now, if he wants to make sure that each tyre runs the same distance, he needs to change the tyres after every 25% of the total distance travelled. So, 25% of 1,00,000 km is (25/100) x 1,00,000 = 25,000 km. Therefore, Ricky needs to change his tyres after every 25,000 km to ensure that each tyre runs the same distance. Hence, the distance travelled by each tyre is 25,000 km. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 20,000. (Note: The answer choices provided in the question are incorrect as none of them match the correct answer.) The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A man can row his boat with the stream at 18 km/h and against the stream in 8 km/h. The man's rate is? Answer Choices: (A) 5 kmph (B) 2 kmph (C) 7 kmph (D) 8 kmph (E) 3 kmph\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the speed of the stream be x km/h and the speed of the man be y km/h. When the man rows with the stream, his effective speed is (y + x) km/h. When the man rows against the stream, his effective speed is (y - x) km/h. We are given that: (y + x) = 18 km/h (y - x) = 8 km/h Adding the two equations, we get: 2y = 26 km/h y = 13 km/h Therefore, the man's rate is 13 km/h. The answer is not in the given options. Hence, the answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 25 copies per minute. A second copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 55 copies per minute. Working together at their respective rates, how many copies do the two machines make in half an hour ? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 2,400 (C) 4,500 (D) 5,400 (E) 324,000\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the combined rate of the two machines. To do this, we add their individual rates: 25 copies/minute + 55 copies/minute = 80 copies/minute Next, we need to convert half an hour to minutes: 30 minutes Now we can use the formula: rate x time = amount Plugging in the values we have: 80 copies/minute x 30 minutes = 2400 copies Therefore, the answer is (B) 2,400. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: On a certain transatlantic crossing, 40 percent of a ship\u2019s passengers held round-trip tickets and also took their cars abroad the ship. If 50 percent of the passengers with round-trip tickets did not take their cars abroad the ship, what percent of the ship\u2019s passengers held round-trip tickets? Answer Choices: (A) 40% (B) 50% (C) 60% (D) 80% (E) 90%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that there are 100 passengers on the ship. 40% of the passengers held round-trip tickets and took their cars abroad the ship, which means there are 40 passengers who fit this description. Now, we know that 50% of the passengers with round-trip tickets did not take their cars abroad the ship. So, out of the 40 passengers with round-trip tickets, 50% did not take their cars, which means 20 passengers did not take their cars. Therefore, the remaining 20 passengers with round-trip tickets did take their cars abroad the ship. To find the percentage of passengers with round-trip tickets, we divide the total number of passengers (100) into the number of passengers with round-trip tickets (40). 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%. So, the answer is (A) 40%. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
