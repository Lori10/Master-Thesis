  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Ricky likes to keep a spare tyre in his car every time. On a certain day, he travels 1, 00,000 km and just to make the most of all the tyres, he changes the tyres between his journey such that each tyre runs the same distance.\nWhat is the distance travelled by each tyre? Answer Choices: (A) 20000 (B) 35000 (C) 70000 (D) 60000 (E) 80000\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. Let's assume that Ricky has four tyres in total, including the spare tyre. Now, if he wants to make sure that each tyre runs the same distance, he needs to change the tyres after every 25% of the total distance travelled. So, 25% of 1,00,000 km is (25/100) x 1,00,000 = 25,000 km. Therefore, Ricky needs to change his tyres after every 25,000 km to ensure that each tyre runs the same distance. Hence, the distance travelled by each tyre is 25,000 km. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 20,000. (Note: The answer choices provided in the question are incorrect as none of them match the correct answer.) The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Jamboree and GMAT Club Contest Starts\nQUESTION #20:\nHow many words (with or without meaning) can be formed using all the letters of the word \u201cSELFIE\u201d so that the two E\u2019s are not together? Answer Choices: (A)  660 (B)  600 (C)  500 (D)  300 (E)  240\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of ways to arrange all the letters of the word \"SELFIE\". This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken all at a time, which is n!. In this case, n = 6, so the total number of arrangements is 6! = 720. Next, we need to subtract the number of arrangements where the two E's are together. To do this, we can treat the two E's as a single object and find the number of arrangements of the five objects \"S\", \"L\", \"F\", \"I\", and \"EE\". This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is nPr = n!/(n-r)!. In this case, n = 5 and r = 5, so the number of arrangements where the two E's are together is 5! = 120. Finally, we can subtract the number of arrangements where the two E's are together from the total number of arrangements to get the number of arrangements where the two E's are not together: 720 - 120 = 600. Therefore, the answer is (B) 600. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: 69 laboratories raise the bacterium, the laboratory have 48 culture dishes on average, which has about 25,075 bacteria each. How many bacteria are there approximately? Answer Choices: (A) 10^7 (B) 10^8 (C) 10^9 (D) 10^10 (E) 10^11\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of culture dishes in all the laboratories. Total number of culture dishes = 69 x 48 = 3312 Step 2: Find the total number of bacteria in all the culture dishes. Total number of bacteria = 3312 x 25,075 = 83,076,000 Step 3: Convert the total number of bacteria into scientific notation. 83,076,000 = 8.3076 x 10^7 Therefore, the answer is (A) 10^7. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: On a certain transatlantic crossing, 40 percent of a ship\u2019s passengers held round-trip tickets and also took their cars abroad the ship. If 50 percent of the passengers with round-trip tickets did not take their cars abroad the ship, what percent of the ship\u2019s passengers held round-trip tickets? Answer Choices: (A) 40% (B) 50% (C) 60% (D) 80% (E) 90%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that there are 100 passengers on the ship. 40% of the passengers held round-trip tickets and took their cars abroad the ship, which means there are 40 passengers who fit this description. Now, we know that 50% of the passengers with round-trip tickets did not take their cars abroad the ship. So, out of the 40 passengers with round-trip tickets, 50% did not take their cars, which means 20 passengers did not take their cars. Therefore, the remaining 20 passengers with round-trip tickets did take their cars abroad the ship. To find the percentage of passengers with round-trip tickets, we divide the total number of passengers (100) into the number of passengers with round-trip tickets (40). 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%. So, the answer is (A) 40%. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
