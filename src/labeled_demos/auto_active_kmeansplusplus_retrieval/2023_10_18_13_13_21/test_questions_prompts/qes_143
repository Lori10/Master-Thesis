  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Ayush was born two years after his father's marriage. His mother is five years younger than his father but 22 years older than Ayush who is 10 years old. At what age did the father get married ? Answer Choices: (A) 22years (B) 23years (C) 24years (D) 25years (E) 26years\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the father got married at age x. According to the problem, Ayush is currently 10 years old. Therefore, his father's age would be (x + 10) years old. We also know that Ayush's mother is 5 years younger than his father. Therefore, her age would be (x + 10 - 5) = (x + 5) years old. Finally, we know that Ayush's mother is 22 years older than Ayush. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 5 = 10 + 22 Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 27 Therefore, the father got married at age 27 - 2 = 25 years old. The correct answer is (D) 25 years. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: The average salary/head of all the workers ina workshop is Rs.850, if the average salary/head of 7technician is Rs.1000 and the average salary/head of the rest is Rs.780, the total no. of workers in the work-shop is ? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 23 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the total number of workers in the workshop be x. We know that the average salary/head of all workers is Rs. 850. So, the total salary of all workers = 850x. We also know that the average salary/head of 7 technicians is Rs. 1000. So, the total salary of these 7 technicians = 1000 x 7 = 7000. Now, we can find the total salary of the remaining workers by subtracting the total salary of the technicians from the total salary of all workers: Total salary of remaining workers = 850x - 7000. We also know that the average salary/head of the remaining workers is Rs. 780. So, we can set up an equation: (850x - 7000) / (x - 7) = 780 Solving for x, we get x = 22. Therefore, the total number of workers in the workshop is 22. The answer is (C) 22. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In what ratio mental A at Rs.68 per kg be mixed with another metal at Rs.96 per kg so that cost of alloy (mixture) is Rs.72 per kg? Answer Choices: (A) 6:1 (B) 4:7 (C) 3:7 (D) 9:5 (E) 9:8\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the ratio of mental A to the other metal be x:y. Then, the cost of 1 kg of the alloy is given by: (68x + 96y)/(x+y) = 72 Multiplying both sides by (x+y), we get: 68x + 96y = 72(x+y) Expanding and simplifying, we get: 4x = 3y So, the ratio of mental A to the other metal is 4:3. However, this is not one of the answer choices. We can try simplifying the ratio further by dividing both sides by 3: 4/3 : 1 Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: 4 : 3 So, the ratio of mental A to the other metal is 4:3, which is equivalent to option (None of the above). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: What annual payment dischargea debit of Rs.12900, due in 4yrs.At 5% rate? Answer Choices: (A) 2300 (B) 2400 (C) 3000 (D) 3500 (E) 3600\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the formula for the present value of an annuity to solve this problem. The formula is: PV = A * (1 - (1 + r)^(-n)) / r where PV is the present value of the annuity, A is the annual payment, r is the interest rate per period, and n is the number of periods. In this case, we know that PV = Rs. 12900, r = 5% per year, and n = 4 years. We want to solve for A. Plugging in the values, we get: 12900 = A * (1 - (1 + 0.05)^(-4)) / 0.05 Simplifying the right-hand side, we get: 12900 = A * (1 - 0.8227) 12900 = A * 0.1773 A = 12900 / 0.1773 A = 72877.5 However, this is the total amount that would discharge the debt in one payment. We want to know the annual payment, so we need to divide by the number of years: Annual payment = 72877.5 / 4 Annual payment = 18219.375 None of the answer choices match this result, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
