  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A number is said to be prime saturated if the product of all the different positive prime factors of e is less than the square root of e. What is the greatest two digit prime saturated integer ? Answer Choices: (A) 99 (B) 98 (C) 97 (D) 96 (E) 95\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. First, we need to find all the prime factors of a number. Second, we need to find the product of all the different prime factors. Third, we need to compare this product with the square root of the number. Fourth, we need to repeat this process for all two-digit numbers and find the greatest prime saturated integer. Let's start with the first step. The prime numbers less than or equal to 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Any two-digit number that is not divisible by these primes is not prime saturated. Let's try 98. The prime factors of 98 are 2 and 7. The product of these primes is 14, which is less than the square root of 98 (which is approximately 9.9). Therefore, 98 is prime saturated. Let's try 99. The prime factors of 99 are 3 and 11. The product of these primes is 33, which is greater than the square root of 99 (which is approximately 9.95). Therefore, 99 is not prime saturated. Let's try 97. 97 is a prime number, so its only prime factor is itself. The product of this prime is 97, which is less than the square root of 97 (which is approximately 9.85). Therefore, 97 is prime saturated. Let's try 96. The prime factors of 96 are 2, 3, and 5. The product of these primes is 30, which is less than the square root of 96 (which is approximately 9.8). Therefore, 96 is prime saturated. Let's try 95. The prime factors of 95 are 5 and 19. The product of these primes is 95, which is equal to the square root of 95. Therefore, 95 is not prime saturated. Therefore, the greatest prime saturated two-digit integer is 98, which is option (B). The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Which of the following inequalities has a solution set, when graphed on the number line, is a single line segment of finite length? Answer Choices: (A) 2 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (B) 3 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (C) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (D) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (E) 4 <= 3x+4 <= 6\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to isolate the variable (x) in the inequality. We can do this by subtracting 4 from all parts of the inequality: (A) 2 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes -2 <= 3x <= 2 (B) 3 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes -1 <= 3x <= 2 (C) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes 1 <= 3x <= 2 (D) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes 1 <= 3x <= 2 (E) 4 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes 0 <= 3x <= 2 Now we can divide all parts of the inequality by 3: (A) -2/3 <= x <= 2/3 (B) -1/3 <= x <= 2/3 (C) 1/3 <= x <= 2/3 (D) 1/3 <= x <= 2/3 (E) 0 <= x <= 2/3 Option (C) has a solution set that is a single line segment of finite length, from x=1/3 to x=2/3. Therefore, the correct answer is (C). The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If y/(x - z) = (y + x)/z = x/y then find x : y : z ? Answer Choices: (A) 1 : 2 : 3 (B) 3 : 2 : 1 (C) 4 : 2 : 3 (D) 2 : 4 : 7 (E) none of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can simplify the second ratio by cross-multiplying to get z(y + x) = (y)(y + x), which simplifies to y^2 = zx. Next, we can substitute this expression for y^2 into the first ratio to get y/(x - z) = (y + x)/z = x/zx^(1/2). Simplifying this expression, we get y = x^(3/2)/(x - z) and z = x^(1/2)/(x - z). Now, we can substitute these expressions for y and z into the ratio y^2 : x : z to get x^(3/2)/(x - z)^2 : x : x^(1/2)/(x - z). Simplifying this expression, we get x^(5/2) : x(x - z)^2 : x^(3/2)(x - z). Cancelling out an x from each term, we get x^(3/2) : (x - z)^2 : x^(1/2). Now, we can substitute the expression for z from earlier (z = x^(1/2)/(x - z)) into this ratio to get x^(3/2) : (x - x^(1/2))^2 : x^(1/2). Simplifying this expression, we get x^(3/2) : (x^2 - 2x^(3/2) + x) : x^(1/2). Finally, we can simplify the middle term by expanding the square and combining like terms to get x^(3/2) : (x^2 - 2x^(3/2) + x) : x^(1/2) = x^(3/2) : (x^2 - x^(3/2)) : x^(1/2) = x^(1/2) : (x - 1) : 1. Therefore, the answer is (E) none of these, since none of the given answer choices match the ratio x^(1/2) : (x - 1) : 1. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In the third grade of Windblown School there are 96 students, one third of them failed the math test and 1/6 failed that literature test. At least how many students failed both tests? Answer Choices: (A) 0. (B) 6. (C) 8. (D) 10. (E) 12.\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of students who failed the math test. One third of the 96 students failed the math test, so: 1/3 x 96 = 32 Therefore, 32 students failed the math test. Step 2: Find the number of students who failed the literature test. 1/6 of the 96 students failed the literature test, so: 1/6 x 96 = 16 Therefore, 16 students failed the literature test. Step 3: Find the number of students who failed both tests. We don't know the exact number of students who failed both tests, but we do know that it must be less than or equal to the smaller of the two numbers we just found (i.e. 16). Therefore, the answer is (B) 6, because that is the only option that is less than or equal to 16. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
