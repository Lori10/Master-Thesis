  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A number is said to be prime saturated if the product of all the different positive prime factors of e is less than the square root of e. What is the greatest two digit prime saturated integer ? Answer Choices: (A) 99 (B) 98 (C) 97 (D) 96 (E) 95\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. First, we need to find all the prime factors of a number. Second, we need to find the product of all the different prime factors. Third, we need to compare this product with the square root of the number. Fourth, we need to repeat this process for all two-digit numbers and find the greatest prime saturated integer. Let's start with the first step. The prime numbers less than or equal to 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Any two-digit number that is not divisible by these primes is not prime saturated. Let's try 98. The prime factors of 98 are 2 and 7. The product of these primes is 14, which is less than the square root of 98 (which is approximately 9.9). Therefore, 98 is prime saturated. Let's try 99. The prime factors of 99 are 3 and 11. The product of these primes is 33, which is greater than the square root of 99 (which is approximately 9.95). Therefore, 99 is not prime saturated. Let's try 97. 97 is a prime number, so its only prime factor is itself. The product of this prime is 97, which is less than the square root of 97 (which is approximately 9.85). Therefore, 97 is prime saturated. Let's try 96. The prime factors of 96 are 2, 3, and 5. The product of these primes is 30, which is less than the square root of 96 (which is approximately 9.8). Therefore, 96 is prime saturated. Let's try 95. The prime factors of 95 are 5 and 19. The product of these primes is 95, which is equal to the square root of 95. Therefore, 95 is not prime saturated. Therefore, the greatest prime saturated two-digit integer is 98, which is option (B). The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Find the odd man out. 187, 264, 316, 473, 682, 781 Answer Choices: (A) 187 (B) 316 (C) 781 (D) 682 (E) 473\nA: Let's think step by step. The numbers seem random, so we need to find a pattern or rule that applies to all except one of the numbers. If we look at the last digit of each number, we can see that they alternate between odd and even: 7, 4, 6, 3, 2, 1. However, this pattern doesn't apply to 316, which ends in an even digit. Therefore, the odd man out is (B) 316. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Jamboree and GMAT Club Contest Starts\nQUESTION #20:\nHow many words (with or without meaning) can be formed using all the letters of the word \u201cSELFIE\u201d so that the two E\u2019s are not together? Answer Choices: (A)  660 (B)  600 (C)  500 (D)  300 (E)  240\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of ways to arrange all the letters of the word \"SELFIE\". This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken all at a time, which is n!. In this case, n = 6, so the total number of arrangements is 6! = 720. Next, we need to subtract the number of arrangements where the two E's are together. To do this, we can treat the two E's as a single object and find the number of arrangements of the five objects \"S\", \"L\", \"F\", \"I\", and \"EE\". This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is nPr = n!/(n-r)!. In this case, n = 5 and r = 5, so the number of arrangements where the two E's are together is 5! = 120. Finally, we can subtract the number of arrangements where the two E's are together from the total number of arrangements to get the number of arrangements where the two E's are not together: 720 - 120 = 600. Therefore, the answer is (B) 600. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: courtyard 3.78 meters long 5.95 meters wide is to be paved exactly with square tiles, all of the same size. what is the largest size of the tile which could be used for the purpose? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 77 (C) 877 (D) 99 (E) 88\nA: Let's think step by step. The area of the courtyard is given by multiplying its length and width: Area = 3.78 x 5.95 = 22.545 square meters Let's assume that each tile has a side length of x meters. Then the number of tiles needed to cover the courtyard can be found by dividing the area of the courtyard by the area of each tile: Number of tiles = Area of courtyard / Area of each tile Number of tiles = 22.545 / x^2 For the largest size of the tile, we want to minimize the number of tiles needed. This means we want to maximize the size of each tile. To maximize the size of each tile, we need to minimize the number of tiles. The number of tiles is minimized when each tile is as large as possible. So, we need to find the largest perfect square that is a factor of 22.545. 22.545 = 3 x 3 x 2.505 The largest perfect square that is a factor of 22.545 is 9. So, the largest size of the tile that could be used is the square root of 9, which is 3 meters. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
