  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In the third grade of Windblown School there are 96 students, one third of them failed the math test and 1/6 failed that literature test. At least how many students failed both tests? Answer Choices: (A) 0. (B) 6. (C) 8. (D) 10. (E) 12.\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of students who failed the math test. One third of the 96 students failed the math test, so: 1/3 x 96 = 32 Therefore, 32 students failed the math test. Step 2: Find the number of students who failed the literature test. 1/6 of the 96 students failed the literature test, so: 1/6 x 96 = 16 Therefore, 16 students failed the literature test. Step 3: Find the number of students who failed both tests. We don't know the exact number of students who failed both tests, but we do know that it must be less than or equal to the smaller of the two numbers we just found (i.e. 16). Therefore, the answer is (B) 6, because that is the only option that is less than or equal to 16. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Of the 600 residents of Clermontville, 35% watch the television show Island Survival, 40% watch Lovelost Lawyers and 50% watch Medical Emergency. If all residents watch at least one of these three shows and 18% watch exactly 2 of these shows, then how many Clermontville residents B watch all of the shows? Answer Choices: (A)  150 (B)  108 (C)  42 (D)  21 (E)  -21\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of residents who watch at least one of the three shows. 35% + 40% + 50% = 125% This means that some residents are being counted twice or even thrice. To find the actual percentage, we need to subtract the percentage of residents who watch exactly two shows and the percentage of residents who watch all three shows. Step 2: Find the percentage of residents who watch exactly two shows. 125% - 18% = 107% Step 3: Find the percentage of residents who watch all three shows. 107% - 100% = 7% Step 4: Find the total number of residents who watch all three shows. 7% of 600 = 42 Therefore, the answer is (C) 42. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A batsman in his 17th innings makes a score of 85 and their by increasing his average by 3. What is his average after the 17thinnings? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 77 (C) 26 (D) 37 (E) 88\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the batsman's average before the 17th innings be x. So, the total runs scored by the batsman in his first 16 innings would be 16x. After the 17th innings, the total runs scored by the batsman would be (16x + 85). Now, we know that the batsman's average increased by 3 after the 17th innings. So, we can set up the equation: (16x + 85)/(17) = (x + 3) Solving for x, we get: x = 22 Therefore, the batsman's average after the 17th innings would be: (16x + 85)/(17) = (16*22 + 85)/(17) = 37 So, the correct answer is (D) 37. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Carmelo and LeBron participate in a seven-person footrace on the basketball court during All-Star Weekend. If all seven contestants finish (including Charles Barkley) and there are no ties, how many different arrangements of finishes are there in which Carmelo defeats LeBron? Answer Choices: (A)  5040 (B)  2520 (C)  720 (D)  120 (E)  42\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to choose the positions for Carmelo and LeBron. There are 2 options for the first place, and once that is decided, there is only 1 option for the second place. Next, we need to arrange the remaining 5 people in the remaining 5 positions. There are 5 options for the third place, 4 options for the fourth place, 3 options for the fifth place, 2 options for the sixth place, and 1 option for the seventh place. Therefore, the total number of arrangements in which Carmelo defeats LeBron is 2 x 1 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 240. None of the answer choices match our result, so the answer is None of the above. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
