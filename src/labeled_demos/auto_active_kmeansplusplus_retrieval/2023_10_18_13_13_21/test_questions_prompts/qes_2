  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A fort had provision of food for 150 men for 60 days. After 10 days, 25 men left the fort. The number of days for which the remaining food will last, is: Answer Choices: (A) 29 1/5 (B) 37 1/4 (C) 42 (D) 54 (E) 60\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total amount of food available in the fort. The provision of food for 150 men for 60 days means that the fort has food for 150 x 60 = 9000 man-days. Step 2: Find the amount of food consumed in the first 10 days. Since there were 150 men in the fort for the first 10 days, the amount of food consumed in the first 10 days is 150 x 10 = 1500 man-days. Step 3: Find the amount of food remaining after 10 days. The amount of food remaining after 10 days is 9000 - 1500 = 7500 man-days. Step 4: Find the number of men remaining in the fort. After 25 men left the fort, the number of men remaining in the fort is 150 - 25 = 125. Step 5: Find the number of days for which the remaining food will last. Let's assume that the remaining food will last for x days. Since the same amount of food is now available for 125 men, the amount of food required for x days is 125x man-days. We know that this amount of food is equal to the remaining food in the fort, which is 7500 man-days. Therefore, we can write the equation: 125x = 7500 Solving for x, we get: x = 60 Therefore, the remaining food will last for 60 days. Answer: (E) 60 The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Salad dressing P is made up of 30% vinegar and 70% oil, and salad dressing Q contains 10% vinegar and 90% oil. If the two dressings are combined to produce a salad dressing that is 12% vinegar, dressing P comprises what percentage of the new dressing? Answer Choices: (A) 50% (B) 40% (C) 30% (D) 20% (E) 10%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that we have 100 ml of the new salad dressing. Let x be the percentage of dressing P in the new dressing. Then, we can write: - The amount of vinegar in dressing P = 30% of x ml - The amount of vinegar in dressing Q = 10% of (100 - x) ml (since the total amount of dressing is 100 ml and we have x ml of dressing P) - The amount of vinegar in the new dressing = 12% of 100 ml = 12 ml Since we are combining the two dressings, the total amount of vinegar in the new dressing is the sum of the amount of vinegar in dressing P and dressing Q. So, we can write: 0.3x + 0.1(100 - x) = 12 Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.2x + 10 = 12 0.2x = 2 x = 10 Therefore, dressing P comprises 10% of the new dressing. The correct answer is (E) 10%. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Elena\u2019s bread recipe calls for 2 ounces of butter for each 5 cups of flour used. She needs to make 4 times the original recipe. If 12 ounces of butter is used, then how many cups of flour are needed? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 4 (C) 9 (D) 13 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much butter is needed for the new recipe. Since Elena needs to make 4 times the original recipe, she will need 4 x 2 = 8 ounces of butter. Next, we can set up a proportion to find out how much flour is needed. We know that for every 2 ounces of butter, 5 cups of flour are used. So, we can write: 2/5 = 8/x where x is the number of cups of flour needed for the new recipe. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 2x = 40 x = 20 Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A doctor prescribed 18 cubic centimeters of a certain drug to a patient whose body weight was 120 pounds. If the typical dosage is 4 cubic centimeters per 15 pounds of the body weight, by what percent was the prescribed dosage lesser than the typical dosage? Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 9% (C) 11% (D) 12.5% (E) -87.5%\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Calculate the typical dosage for a patient weighing 120 pounds. Typical dosage = (4 cubic centimeters / 15 pounds) x 120 pounds = 32 cubic centimeters Step 2: Calculate the difference between the prescribed dosage and the typical dosage. Difference = 32 cubic centimeters - 18 cubic centimeters = 14 cubic centimeters Step 3: Calculate the percentage by which the prescribed dosage is lesser than the typical dosage. Percentage = (Difference / Typical dosage) x 100% Percentage = (14 cubic centimeters / 32 cubic centimeters) x 100% Percentage = 43.75% None of the answer choices match the calculated percentage, so the answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
