  "test_question": "Q: Julie\u2019s yard is rectangular. One side of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. What is the length of the other side of the yard? Answer Choices: (A) 30 feet (B) 20 feet (C) 10 feet (D) 50 feet (E) 60 feet",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: courtyard 3.78 meters long 5.95 meters wide is to be paved exactly with square tiles, all of the same size. what is the largest size of the tile which could be used for the purpose? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 77 (C) 877 (D) 99 (E) 88\nA: Let's think step by step. The area of the courtyard is given by multiplying its length and width: Area = 3.78 x 5.95 = 22.545 square meters Let's assume that each tile has a side length of x meters. Then the number of tiles needed to cover the courtyard can be found by dividing the area of the courtyard by the area of each tile: Number of tiles = Area of courtyard / Area of each tile Number of tiles = 22.545 / x^2 For the largest size of the tile, we want to minimize the number of tiles needed. This means we want to maximize the size of each tile. To maximize the size of each tile, we need to minimize the number of tiles. The number of tiles is minimized when each tile is as large as possible. So, we need to find the largest perfect square that is a factor of 22.545. 22.545 = 3 x 3 x 2.505 The largest perfect square that is a factor of 22.545 is 9. So, the largest size of the tile that could be used is the square root of 9, which is 3 meters. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: the perimeter of an equilateral triangle is 45.if one of the side is the side of an isoceles triangle of perimeter 40 then what is the lenght of base of isoceles triangle. Answer Choices: (A) 10 units (B) 20 units (C) 30 units (D) 40 units (E) 15 units\nA: Let's think step by step. The perimeter of an equilateral triangle is 45, which means each side is 15 units long. Now, we know that one of the sides of an isosceles triangle is also 15 units long. Let's call the length of the base of the isosceles triangle \"b\". Since the perimeter of the isosceles triangle is 40, we can set up an equation: 15 + 15 + b = 40 Simplifying this equation, we get: 30 + b = 40 Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: b = 10 Therefore, the length of the base of the isosceles triangle is 10 units. The correct answer is (A) 10 units. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Three friends-whose walking rates are 1 ft./sec., 3ft./sec.,and 6ft./sec. start together walking in the same direction around a circular track that is 420 feet in circumference.After how many minutes are the three of them together again? Answer Choices: (A) 5 mins (B) 10 mins (C) 15 mins (D) 3 mins (E) 7 mins\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for each friend to complete one full lap around the track. We can use the formula: time = distance / rate For the friend with a walking rate of 1 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 1 ft./sec. = 420 sec. For the friend with a walking rate of 3 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 3 ft./sec. = 140 sec. For the friend with a walking rate of 6 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 6 ft./sec. = 70 sec. Now we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these three times, which will give us the time it takes for all three friends to be together again. The LCM of 420 sec., 140 sec., and 70 sec. is 420 sec. Converting 420 sec. to minutes, we get: 420 sec. / 60 sec./min. = 7 min. Therefore, the answer is (E) 7 mins. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: An object thrown directly upward is at a height of h feet after t seconds, where h = -15 (t-2)^2 + 150. At what height, in feet, is the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 90 (C) 124 (D) 132 (E) 140\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the maximum height of the object. We can do this by finding the vertex of the quadratic equation h = -15(t-2)^2 + 150. The vertex of a quadratic equation in the form of h = a(t-b)^2 + c is (b, c). In this case, the vertex is (2, 150). This means that the object reaches its maximum height of 150 feet after 2 seconds. Next, we need to find the height of the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height. We can do this by plugging in t = 4 (2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height) into the equation h = -15(t-2)^2 + 150. h = -15(4-2)^2 + 150 h = -15(2)^2 + 150 h = -60 + 150 h = 90 Therefore, the height of the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height is 90 feet. The correct answer is (B) 90. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
