  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A club with a total membership of 25 has formed 3 committees, M, S and R, which have 8, 12 and 5 members respectively. If no members of committee M is on either of the other 2 committees, what is the greatest possible number of members in the club who are on none of the committees? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 7 (C) 8 (D) 10 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of members who are on the committees. M has 8 members, S has 12 members, and R has 5 members. Since no members of M are on either of the other 2 committees, we can subtract the 8 members of M from the total number of committee members: Total committee members = 8 + 12 + 5 - 8 = 17 So, there are 17 members on the committees. To find the greatest possible number of members who are on none of the committees, we need to subtract this number from the total membership of the club: Greatest possible number of members not on committees = 25 - 17 = 8 Therefore, the answer is (C) 8. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Peter has $642,986 in his savings account. What is the least amount of money (in whole number of dollars) that he must add to his account if he wants to split this money evenly among his nine children? Answer Choices: (A) $642,986 (B) $642,987 (C) $642,988 (D) $642,989 (E) $642,990\nA: Let's think step by step. Peter wants to split his savings evenly among his nine children. This means he needs to divide his savings by 9 to find out how much each child will get. $642,986 \u00f7 9 = $71,443.88 However, we need to add a whole number of dollars to his account, so we need to round up to the nearest dollar. $71,443.88 rounded up to the nearest dollar is $71,444. Therefore, Peter needs to add $71,444 to his savings account to split the money evenly among his nine children. The correct answer is (D) $642,989. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: The C.P of 15 books is equal to the S.P of 18 books. Find his gain% or loss%? Answer Choices: (A) 16 2/3% (B) 16 2/8% (C) 16 7/3% (D) 16 5/3% (E) 16 6/3%\nA: Let's think step by step. Given, C.P of 15 books = S.P of 18 books Let the cost price of 1 book be x. Then, the cost price of 15 books = 15x And, the selling price of 18 books = 18x Now, we need to find the gain or loss percentage. Gain or Loss percentage = [(Selling price - Cost price) / Cost price] x 100 Since the selling price is greater than the cost price, there is a gain. Gain percentage = [(18x - 15x) / 15x] x 100 = (3x / 15x) x 100 = 20% Therefore, the answer is not in the given options. The correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In a certain province in France there are 11 cities. If a single road segment connects only two cities, how many road segments are required in order to connect the cities so that each city is connected to all other cities with a single road segment? Answer Choices: (A) 55 (B) 105 (C) 330 (D) 143 (E) 156\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. There are 11 cities in the province. We need to connect each city to all other cities with a single road segment. Let's start with one city. It needs to be connected to 10 other cities. Moving on to the next city, it also needs to be connected to 10 other cities. But we have already connected it to one city, so it needs to be connected to 9 more cities. Similarly, for the third city, it needs to be connected to 8 more cities. We can continue this pattern until we reach the last city, which needs to be connected to only one more city. So, the total number of road segments required would be: 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 55 Therefore, the answer is (A) 55. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
