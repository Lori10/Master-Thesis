  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Which of the following inequalities has a solution set, when graphed on the number line, is a single line segment of finite length? Answer Choices: (A) 2 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (B) 3 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (C) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (D) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (E) 4 <= 3x+4 <= 6\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to isolate the variable (x) in the inequality. We can do this by subtracting 4 from all parts of the inequality: (A) 2 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes -2 <= 3x <= 2 (B) 3 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes -1 <= 3x <= 2 (C) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes 1 <= 3x <= 2 (D) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes 1 <= 3x <= 2 (E) 4 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes 0 <= 3x <= 2 Now we can divide all parts of the inequality by 3: (A) -2/3 <= x <= 2/3 (B) -1/3 <= x <= 2/3 (C) 1/3 <= x <= 2/3 (D) 1/3 <= x <= 2/3 (E) 0 <= x <= 2/3 Option (C) has a solution set that is a single line segment of finite length, from x=1/3 to x=2/3. Therefore, the correct answer is (C). The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If y/(x - z) = (y + x)/z = x/y then find x : y : z ? Answer Choices: (A) 1 : 2 : 3 (B) 3 : 2 : 1 (C) 4 : 2 : 3 (D) 2 : 4 : 7 (E) none of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can simplify the second ratio by cross-multiplying to get z(y + x) = (y)(y + x), which simplifies to y^2 = zx. Next, we can substitute this expression for y^2 into the first ratio to get y/(x - z) = (y + x)/z = x/zx^(1/2). Simplifying this expression, we get y = x^(3/2)/(x - z) and z = x^(1/2)/(x - z). Now, we can substitute these expressions for y and z into the ratio y^2 : x : z to get x^(3/2)/(x - z)^2 : x : x^(1/2)/(x - z). Simplifying this expression, we get x^(5/2) : x(x - z)^2 : x^(3/2)(x - z). Cancelling out an x from each term, we get x^(3/2) : (x - z)^2 : x^(1/2). Now, we can substitute the expression for z from earlier (z = x^(1/2)/(x - z)) into this ratio to get x^(3/2) : (x - x^(1/2))^2 : x^(1/2). Simplifying this expression, we get x^(3/2) : (x^2 - 2x^(3/2) + x) : x^(1/2). Finally, we can simplify the middle term by expanding the square and combining like terms to get x^(3/2) : (x^2 - 2x^(3/2) + x) : x^(1/2) = x^(3/2) : (x^2 - x^(3/2)) : x^(1/2) = x^(1/2) : (x - 1) : 1. Therefore, the answer is (E) none of these, since none of the given answer choices match the ratio x^(1/2) : (x - 1) : 1. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Angles AMB and CMD are right angles, \u2220AMD is acute, and \u2220BMC=y\u00b0 is acute. What is \u2220AMD ? Answer Choices: (A) 90\u00b0\u2212y (B) 180\u00b0\u2212y (C) 90\u00b0+y (D) 2y (E) y\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that angles AMB and CMD are right angles, which means they are both equal to 90 degrees. We also know that angle BMC is acute, which means it is less than 90 degrees. Since angles AMB and CMD are both right angles, they add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, angle AMD must be acute since it is less than 180 degrees. Now, let's use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. In triangle AMD, we have angles AMD, AMB, and CMD. AMD + AMB + CMD = 180 Substituting in the values we know: AMD + 90 + 90 = 180 Simplifying: AMD + 180 = 180 AMD = 0 This doesn't make sense since we know that angle AMD is acute. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: If north becomes south-west ant south-west becomes east and all the directions changed in the same manner,then what will be the direction for south-east? Answer Choices: (A) North-West (B) North-East (C) North (D) West (E) none\nA: Let's think step by step. If north becomes south-west, then south-west becomes north-east. Similarly, if south-west becomes east, then east becomes south. Therefore, we can conclude that south-east will become west. So, the correct answer is (D) West. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
