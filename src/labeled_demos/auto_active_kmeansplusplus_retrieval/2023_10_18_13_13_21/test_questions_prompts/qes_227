The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5(\u221a3 + 1)  (B) 6(\u221a3 + \u221a2)  (C) 7(\u221a3 \u2013 1)  (D) 8(\u221a3 \u2013 2)  (E) None of these",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: An object thrown directly upward is at a height of h feet after t seconds, where h = -15 (t-2)^2 + 150. At what height, in feet, is the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 90 (C) 124 (D) 132 (E) 140\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the maximum height of the object. We can do this by finding the vertex of the quadratic equation h = -15(t-2)^2 + 150. The vertex of a quadratic equation in the form of h = a(t-b)^2 + c is (b, c). In this case, the vertex is (2, 150). This means that the object reaches its maximum height of 150 feet after 2 seconds. Next, we need to find the height of the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height. We can do this by plugging in t = 4 (2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height) into the equation h = -15(t-2)^2 + 150. h = -15(4-2)^2 + 150 h = -15(2)^2 + 150 h = -60 + 150 h = 90 Therefore, the height of the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height is 90 feet. The correct answer is (B) 90. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Three friends-whose walking rates are 1 ft./sec., 3ft./sec.,and 6ft./sec. start together walking in the same direction around a circular track that is 420 feet in circumference.After how many minutes are the three of them together again? Answer Choices: (A) 5 mins (B) 10 mins (C) 15 mins (D) 3 mins (E) 7 mins\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for each friend to complete one full lap around the track. We can use the formula: time = distance / rate For the friend with a walking rate of 1 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 1 ft./sec. = 420 sec. For the friend with a walking rate of 3 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 3 ft./sec. = 140 sec. For the friend with a walking rate of 6 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 6 ft./sec. = 70 sec. Now we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these three times, which will give us the time it takes for all three friends to be together again. The LCM of 420 sec., 140 sec., and 70 sec. is 420 sec. Converting 420 sec. to minutes, we get: 420 sec. / 60 sec./min. = 7 min. Therefore, the answer is (E) 7 mins. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: the perimeter of an equilateral triangle is 45.if one of the side is the side of an isoceles triangle of perimeter 40 then what is the lenght of base of isoceles triangle. Answer Choices: (A) 10 units (B) 20 units (C) 30 units (D) 40 units (E) 15 units\nA: Let's think step by step. The perimeter of an equilateral triangle is 45, which means each side is 15 units long. Now, we know that one of the sides of an isosceles triangle is also 15 units long. Let's call the length of the base of the isosceles triangle \"b\". Since the perimeter of the isosceles triangle is 40, we can set up an equation: 15 + 15 + b = 40 Simplifying this equation, we get: 30 + b = 40 Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: b = 10 Therefore, the length of the base of the isosceles triangle is 10 units. The correct answer is (A) 10 units. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A man can row his boat with the stream at 18 km/h and against the stream in 8 km/h. The man's rate is? Answer Choices: (A) 5 kmph (B) 2 kmph (C) 7 kmph (D) 8 kmph (E) 3 kmph\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the speed of the stream be x km/h and the speed of the man be y km/h. When the man rows with the stream, his effective speed is (y + x) km/h. When the man rows against the stream, his effective speed is (y - x) km/h. We are given that: (y + x) = 18 km/h (y - x) = 8 km/h Adding the two equations, we get: 2y = 26 km/h y = 13 km/h Therefore, the man's rate is 13 km/h. The answer is not in the given options. Hence, the answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
