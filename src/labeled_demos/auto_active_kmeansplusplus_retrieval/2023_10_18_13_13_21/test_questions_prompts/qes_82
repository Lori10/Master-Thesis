  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Gautami went to the stationers and bought things worth Rs. 100, out of which 50 paise went on sales tax on taxable purchases. If the tax rate was 5%. then what was the cost of the tax free items? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 99.50 (B) Rs. 70.50 (C) Rs. 89.50 (D) Rs. 69.50 (E) Rs. 80.50\nA: Let's think step by step. The total cost of the items including tax is Rs. 100. Out of this, 50 paise (or Rs. 0.50) went on sales tax. We know that the tax rate is 5%. So, we can set up an equation: 5% of the taxable purchases = Rs. 0.50 To find the cost of tax-free items, we need to subtract the tax amount from the total cost: Cost of tax-free items = Total cost - Tax amount Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 100 - Rs. 0.50 Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 99.50 Therefore, the answer is (A) Rs. 99.50. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: When sold at a 60% discount, a sweater nets the merchant a 20% profit on the wholesale cost at which he initially purchased the item. By what % is the sweater marked up from wholesale at its normal retail price? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 66.67% (D) 80% (E) 100%\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that the wholesale cost of the sweater is $100. If the merchant sells the sweater at a 60% discount, he sells it for 40% of the original price, which is $40. Now, we know that the merchant makes a 20% profit on the wholesale cost at which he initially purchased the item. So, the cost price for the merchant is $100, and he makes a profit of 20%, which is $20. Therefore, the selling price for the merchant is $120. We can now calculate the markup percentage from the wholesale price to the normal retail price. Markup percentage = (Selling price - Wholesale price) / Wholesale price x 100% Markup percentage = ($120 - $100) / $100 x 100% Markup percentage = 20% Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 20%. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The C.P of 15 books is equal to the S.P of 18 books. Find his gain% or loss%? Answer Choices: (A) 16 2/3% (B) 16 2/8% (C) 16 7/3% (D) 16 5/3% (E) 16 6/3%\nA: Let's think step by step. Given, C.P of 15 books = S.P of 18 books Let the cost price of 1 book be x. Then, the cost price of 15 books = 15x And, the selling price of 18 books = 18x Now, we need to find the gain or loss percentage. Gain or Loss percentage = [(Selling price - Cost price) / Cost price] x 100 Since the selling price is greater than the cost price, there is a gain. Gain percentage = [(18x - 15x) / 15x] x 100 = (3x / 15x) x 100 = 20% Therefore, the answer is not in the given options. The correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The average salary/head of all the workers ina workshop is Rs.850, if the average salary/head of 7technician is Rs.1000 and the average salary/head of the rest is Rs.780, the total no. of workers in the work-shop is ? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 23 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the total number of workers in the workshop be x. We know that the average salary/head of all workers is Rs. 850. So, the total salary of all workers = 850x. We also know that the average salary/head of 7 technicians is Rs. 1000. So, the total salary of these 7 technicians = 1000 x 7 = 7000. Now, we can find the total salary of the remaining workers by subtracting the total salary of the technicians from the total salary of all workers: Total salary of remaining workers = 850x - 7000. We also know that the average salary/head of the remaining workers is Rs. 780. So, we can set up an equation: (850x - 7000) / (x - 7) = 780 Solving for x, we get x = 22. Therefore, the total number of workers in the workshop is 22. The answer is (C) 22. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
