  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The average salary/head of all the workers ina workshop is Rs.850, if the average salary/head of 7technician is Rs.1000 and the average salary/head of the rest is Rs.780, the total no. of workers in the work-shop is ? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 23 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the total number of workers in the workshop be x. We know that the average salary/head of all workers is Rs. 850. So, the total salary of all workers = 850x. We also know that the average salary/head of 7 technicians is Rs. 1000. So, the total salary of these 7 technicians = 1000 x 7 = 7000. Now, we can find the total salary of the remaining workers by subtracting the total salary of the technicians from the total salary of all workers: Total salary of remaining workers = 850x - 7000. We also know that the average salary/head of the remaining workers is Rs. 780. So, we can set up an equation: (850x - 7000) / (x - 7) = 780 Solving for x, we get x = 22. Therefore, the total number of workers in the workshop is 22. The answer is (C) 22. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Gautami went to the stationers and bought things worth Rs. 100, out of which 50 paise went on sales tax on taxable purchases. If the tax rate was 5%. then what was the cost of the tax free items? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 99.50 (B) Rs. 70.50 (C) Rs. 89.50 (D) Rs. 69.50 (E) Rs. 80.50\nA: Let's think step by step. The total cost of the items including tax is Rs. 100. Out of this, 50 paise (or Rs. 0.50) went on sales tax. We know that the tax rate is 5%. So, we can set up an equation: 5% of the taxable purchases = Rs. 0.50 To find the cost of tax-free items, we need to subtract the tax amount from the total cost: Cost of tax-free items = Total cost - Tax amount Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 100 - Rs. 0.50 Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 99.50 Therefore, the answer is (A) Rs. 99.50. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Peter has $642,986 in his savings account. What is the least amount of money (in whole number of dollars) that he must add to his account if he wants to split this money evenly among his nine children? Answer Choices: (A) $642,986 (B) $642,987 (C) $642,988 (D) $642,989 (E) $642,990\nA: Let's think step by step. Peter wants to split his savings evenly among his nine children. This means he needs to divide his savings by 9 to find out how much each child will get. $642,986 \u00f7 9 = $71,443.88 However, we need to add a whole number of dollars to his account, so we need to round up to the nearest dollar. $71,443.88 rounded up to the nearest dollar is $71,444. Therefore, Peter needs to add $71,444 to his savings account to split the money evenly among his nine children. The correct answer is (D) $642,989. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: In what ratio mental A at Rs.68 per kg be mixed with another metal at Rs.96 per kg so that cost of alloy (mixture) is Rs.72 per kg? Answer Choices: (A) 6:1 (B) 4:7 (C) 3:7 (D) 9:5 (E) 9:8\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the ratio of mental A to the other metal be x:y. Then, the cost of 1 kg of the alloy is given by: (68x + 96y)/(x+y) = 72 Multiplying both sides by (x+y), we get: 68x + 96y = 72(x+y) Expanding and simplifying, we get: 4x = 3y So, the ratio of mental A to the other metal is 4:3. However, this is not one of the answer choices. We can try simplifying the ratio further by dividing both sides by 3: 4/3 : 1 Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: 4 : 3 So, the ratio of mental A to the other metal is 4:3, which is equivalent to option (None of the above). The answer is A.\n\n\n"
