  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The average of temperatures at noontime from Monday to Friday is 40; the lowest one is 30, what is the possible maximum range of the temperatures? Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 25 (C) 50 (D) 45 (E) 75\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We know that the average temperature from Monday to Friday is 40. Let's call the sum of the temperatures for those five days \"S\". Then we can write: S/5 = 40 Multiplying both sides by 5, we get: S = 200 We also know that the lowest temperature is 30. Let's call the highest temperature \"H\". Then the range of temperatures is: H - 30 To find the maximum possible range, we need to find the maximum possible value of H. We know that the sum of the temperatures is 200, so: H + 4(40) = 200 Simplifying, we get: H = 40 So the maximum range of temperatures is: 40 - 30 = 10 Therefore, the answer is (A) 20. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Find the odd man out. 187, 264, 316, 473, 682, 781 Answer Choices: (A) 187 (B) 316 (C) 781 (D) 682 (E) 473\nA: Let's think step by step. The numbers seem random, so we need to find a pattern or rule that applies to all except one of the numbers. If we look at the last digit of each number, we can see that they alternate between odd and even: 7, 4, 6, 3, 2, 1. However, this pattern doesn't apply to 316, which ends in an even digit. Therefore, the odd man out is (B) 316. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: what is summation of [3^k(28Ck)] (summation range 28 to k=0) where 28Ck is the number of ways of choosing k items from 28 items?? Answer Choices: (A) 4^28 (B) 4^27 (C) 4^26 (D) 4^25 (E) 4^24\nA: Let's think step by step. We can simplify the expression using the binomial theorem: (1 + 3)^28 = 28C0 * 3^0 + 28C1 * 3^1 + 28C2 * 3^2 + ... + 28C28 * 3^28 Notice that the expression we want to find is the same as the sum of the terms on the right-hand side of the equation above, except that we start the summation at k = 0 instead of k = 28. So we can write: summation of [3^k(28Ck)] (summation range 28 to k=0) = (1 + 3)^28 - 28C0 * 3^0 - 28C1 * 3^1 - 28C2 * 3^2 - ... - 28C27 * 3^27 We can simplify this expression by noticing that: (1 + 3)^28 = 4^28 And: 28C0 * 3^0 = 1 28C1 * 3^1 = 28 * 3 28C2 * 3^2 = 28 * 27 / 2 * 9 ... 28C27 * 3^27 = 28 * 27 * ... * 2 * 3^27 / 2^27 So we have: summation of [3^k(28Ck)] (summation range 28 to k=0) = 4^28 - 1 - 28 * 3 - 28 * 27 / 2 * 9 - ... - 28 * 27 * ... * 2 * 3^27 / 2^27 This expression can be simplified further, but we can already see that the answer is not any of the given options. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If y/(x - z) = (y + x)/z = x/y then find x : y : z ? Answer Choices: (A) 1 : 2 : 3 (B) 3 : 2 : 1 (C) 4 : 2 : 3 (D) 2 : 4 : 7 (E) none of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can simplify the second ratio by cross-multiplying to get z(y + x) = (y)(y + x), which simplifies to y^2 = zx. Next, we can substitute this expression for y^2 into the first ratio to get y/(x - z) = (y + x)/z = x/zx^(1/2). Simplifying this expression, we get y = x^(3/2)/(x - z) and z = x^(1/2)/(x - z). Now, we can substitute these expressions for y and z into the ratio y^2 : x : z to get x^(3/2)/(x - z)^2 : x : x^(1/2)/(x - z). Simplifying this expression, we get x^(5/2) : x(x - z)^2 : x^(3/2)(x - z). Cancelling out an x from each term, we get x^(3/2) : (x - z)^2 : x^(1/2). Now, we can substitute the expression for z from earlier (z = x^(1/2)/(x - z)) into this ratio to get x^(3/2) : (x - x^(1/2))^2 : x^(1/2). Simplifying this expression, we get x^(3/2) : (x^2 - 2x^(3/2) + x) : x^(1/2). Finally, we can simplify the middle term by expanding the square and combining like terms to get x^(3/2) : (x^2 - 2x^(3/2) + x) : x^(1/2) = x^(3/2) : (x^2 - x^(3/2)) : x^(1/2) = x^(1/2) : (x - 1) : 1. Therefore, the answer is (E) none of these, since none of the given answer choices match the ratio x^(1/2) : (x - 1) : 1. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
