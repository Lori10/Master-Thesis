  "formatted_prompt": "Q: An object thrown directly upward is at a height of h feet after t seconds, where h = -15 (t-2)^2 + 150. At what height, in feet, is the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 90 (C) 124 (D) 132 (E) 140\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the maximum height of the object. We can do this by finding the vertex of the quadratic equation h = -15(t-2)^2 + 150. The vertex of a quadratic equation in the form of h = a(t-b)^2 + c is (b, c). In this case, the vertex is (2, 150). This means that the object reaches its maximum height of 150 feet after 2 seconds. Next, we need to find the height of the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height. We can do this by plugging in t = 4 (2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height) into the equation h = -15(t-2)^2 + 150. h = -15(4-2)^2 + 150 h = -15(2)^2 + 150 h = -60 + 150 h = 90 Therefore, the height of the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height is 90 feet. The correct answer is (B) 90. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: courtyard 3.78 meters long 5.95 meters wide is to be paved exactly with square tiles, all of the same size. what is the largest size of the tile which could be used for the purpose? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 77 (C) 877 (D) 99 (E) 88\nA: Let's think step by step. The area of the courtyard is given by multiplying its length and width: Area = 3.78 x 5.95 = 22.545 square meters Let's assume that each tile has a side length of x meters. Then the number of tiles needed to cover the courtyard can be found by dividing the area of the courtyard by the area of each tile: Number of tiles = Area of courtyard / Area of each tile Number of tiles = 22.545 / x^2 For the largest size of the tile, we want to minimize the number of tiles needed. This means we want to maximize the size of each tile. To maximize the size of each tile, we need to minimize the number of tiles. The number of tiles is minimized when each tile is as large as possible. So, we need to find the largest perfect square that is a factor of 22.545. 22.545 = 3 x 3 x 2.505 The largest perfect square that is a factor of 22.545 is 9. So, the largest size of the tile that could be used is the square root of 9, which is 3 meters. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: the perimeter of an equilateral triangle is 45.if one of the side is the side of an isoceles triangle of perimeter 40 then what is the lenght of base of isoceles triangle. Answer Choices: (A) 10 units (B) 20 units (C) 30 units (D) 40 units (E) 15 units\nA: Let's think step by step. The perimeter of an equilateral triangle is 45, which means each side is 15 units long. Now, we know that one of the sides of an isosceles triangle is also 15 units long. Let's call the length of the base of the isosceles triangle \"b\". Since the perimeter of the isosceles triangle is 40, we can set up an equation: 15 + 15 + b = 40 Simplifying this equation, we get: 30 + b = 40 Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: b = 10 Therefore, the length of the base of the isosceles triangle is 10 units. The correct answer is (A) 10 units. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The average of temperatures at noontime from Monday to Friday is 40; the lowest one is 30, what is the possible maximum range of the temperatures? Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 25 (C) 50 (D) 45 (E) 75\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We know that the average temperature from Monday to Friday is 40. Let's call the sum of the temperatures for those five days \"S\". Then we can write: S/5 = 40 Multiplying both sides by 5, we get: S = 200 We also know that the lowest temperature is 30. Let's call the highest temperature \"H\". Then the range of temperatures is: H - 30 To find the maximum possible range, we need to find the maximum possible value of H. We know that the sum of the temperatures is 200, so: H + 4(40) = 200 Simplifying, we get: H = 40 So the maximum range of temperatures is: 40 - 30 = 10 Therefore, the answer is (A) 20. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
