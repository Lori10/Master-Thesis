  "formatted_prompt": "Q: What annual payment dischargea debit of Rs.12900, due in 4yrs.At 5% rate? Answer Choices: (A) 2300 (B) 2400 (C) 3000 (D) 3500 (E) 3600\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the formula for the present value of an annuity to solve this problem. The formula is: PV = A * (1 - (1 + r)^(-n)) / r where PV is the present value of the annuity, A is the annual payment, r is the interest rate per period, and n is the number of periods. In this case, we know that PV = Rs. 12900, r = 5% per year, and n = 4 years. We want to solve for A. Plugging in the values, we get: 12900 = A * (1 - (1 + 0.05)^(-4)) / 0.05 Simplifying the right-hand side, we get: 12900 = A * (1 - 0.8227) 12900 = A * 0.1773 A = 12900 / 0.1773 A = 72877.5 However, this is the total amount that would discharge the debt in one payment. We want to know the annual payment, so we need to divide by the number of years: Annual payment = 72877.5 / 4 Annual payment = 18219.375 None of the answer choices match this result, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: If $10,000 is invested at x percent simple annual interest for n years, which of the following represents the total amount of interest, in dollars, that will be earned by this investment in the n years? Answer Choices: (A) 10,000(x^n)  (B) 10,000(x/100) ^n (C) 10,000n(x/100)  (D) 10,000(1+x/100) ^n (E) 10,000n(1+x/100) \nA: Let's think step by step. The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time In this case, the principal is $10,000, the rate is x percent (which we need to convert to a decimal by dividing by 100), and the time is n years. So, the total amount of interest earned in n years is: Interest = 10,000 * (x/100) * n Simplifying this expression, we get: Interest = 100 * x * n Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 10,000n(x/100). The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Gautami went to the stationers and bought things worth Rs. 100, out of which 50 paise went on sales tax on taxable purchases. If the tax rate was 5%. then what was the cost of the tax free items? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 99.50 (B) Rs. 70.50 (C) Rs. 89.50 (D) Rs. 69.50 (E) Rs. 80.50\nA: Let's think step by step. The total cost of the items including tax is Rs. 100. Out of this, 50 paise (or Rs. 0.50) went on sales tax. We know that the tax rate is 5%. So, we can set up an equation: 5% of the taxable purchases = Rs. 0.50 To find the cost of tax-free items, we need to subtract the tax amount from the total cost: Cost of tax-free items = Total cost - Tax amount Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 100 - Rs. 0.50 Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 99.50 Therefore, the answer is (A) Rs. 99.50. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The average salary/head of all the workers ina workshop is Rs.850, if the average salary/head of 7technician is Rs.1000 and the average salary/head of the rest is Rs.780, the total no. of workers in the work-shop is ? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 23 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the total number of workers in the workshop be x. We know that the average salary/head of all workers is Rs. 850. So, the total salary of all workers = 850x. We also know that the average salary/head of 7 technicians is Rs. 1000. So, the total salary of these 7 technicians = 1000 x 7 = 7000. Now, we can find the total salary of the remaining workers by subtracting the total salary of the technicians from the total salary of all workers: Total salary of remaining workers = 850x - 7000. We also know that the average salary/head of the remaining workers is Rs. 780. So, we can set up an equation: (850x - 7000) / (x - 7) = 780 Solving for x, we get x = 22. Therefore, the total number of workers in the workshop is 22. The answer is (C) 22. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
