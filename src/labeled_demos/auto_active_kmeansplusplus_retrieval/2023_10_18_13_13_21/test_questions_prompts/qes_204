  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Richard has to paint a mural with seven horizontal stripes. He only has enough paint for four red stripes, four blue stripes, four white stripes. If his patron wants at most two different colors in the mural, how many different ways can he paint the wall? Answer Choices: (A) 210 (B) 350 (C) 700 (D) 2,520 (E) 5,040\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to consider the case where Richard uses only one color. He can choose any of the three colors, so there are 3 ways to paint the mural with only one color. Next, we need to consider the case where Richard uses two colors. He can choose any two colors out of the three, which can be done in 3C2 = 3 ways. For each choice of colors, he can paint the mural in the following ways: - 2 stripes of one color, 5 stripes of the other color: 4C2 x 4C5 = 6 x 4 = 24 - 3 stripes of one color, 4 stripes of the other color: 4C3 x 4C4 = 4 x 1 = 4 So, there are 3 x (24 + 4) = 84 ways to paint the mural with two colors. Therefore, the total number of ways to paint the mural is 3 + 84 = 87. None of the above answer choices match our answer, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: courtyard 3.78 meters long 5.95 meters wide is to be paved exactly with square tiles, all of the same size. what is the largest size of the tile which could be used for the purpose? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 77 (C) 877 (D) 99 (E) 88\nA: Let's think step by step. The area of the courtyard is given by multiplying its length and width: Area = 3.78 x 5.95 = 22.545 square meters Let's assume that each tile has a side length of x meters. Then the number of tiles needed to cover the courtyard can be found by dividing the area of the courtyard by the area of each tile: Number of tiles = Area of courtyard / Area of each tile Number of tiles = 22.545 / x^2 For the largest size of the tile, we want to minimize the number of tiles needed. This means we want to maximize the size of each tile. To maximize the size of each tile, we need to minimize the number of tiles. The number of tiles is minimized when each tile is as large as possible. So, we need to find the largest perfect square that is a factor of 22.545. 22.545 = 3 x 3 x 2.505 The largest perfect square that is a factor of 22.545 is 9. So, the largest size of the tile that could be used is the square root of 9, which is 3 meters. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: the perimeter of an equilateral triangle is 45.if one of the side is the side of an isoceles triangle of perimeter 40 then what is the lenght of base of isoceles triangle. Answer Choices: (A) 10 units (B) 20 units (C) 30 units (D) 40 units (E) 15 units\nA: Let's think step by step. The perimeter of an equilateral triangle is 45, which means each side is 15 units long. Now, we know that one of the sides of an isosceles triangle is also 15 units long. Let's call the length of the base of the isosceles triangle \"b\". Since the perimeter of the isosceles triangle is 40, we can set up an equation: 15 + 15 + b = 40 Simplifying this equation, we get: 30 + b = 40 Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: b = 10 Therefore, the length of the base of the isosceles triangle is 10 units. The correct answer is (A) 10 units. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A drink vendor has 60 liters of Maaza, 144 liters of Pepsi and 368 liters of Sprite. He wants to pack them in cans, so that each can contains the same number of liters of a drink, and doesn't want to mix any two drinks in a can. What is the least number of cans required? Answer Choices: (A) 135 (B) 137 (C) 143 (D) 310 (E) 380\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 60, 144, and 368 to determine the maximum number of liters that can be packed in a can. The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. The prime factorization of 144 is 2^4 * 3^2. The prime factorization of 368 is 2^4 * 23. The GCD of these three numbers is 12 (2^2 * 3). Therefore, each can can contain a maximum of 12 liters of a drink. To find the least number of cans required, we need to divide each quantity by 12 and round up to the nearest integer. 60/12 = 5 144/12 = 12 368/12 = 31 So we need at least 5 cans of Maaza, 12 cans of Pepsi, and 31 cans of Sprite. The total number of cans required is 5 + 12 + 31 = 48. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
