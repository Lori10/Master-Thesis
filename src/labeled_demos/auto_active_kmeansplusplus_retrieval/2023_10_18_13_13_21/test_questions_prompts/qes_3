First, we can simplify the second ratio by cross-multiplying to get z(y + x) = (y)(y + x), which simplifies to y^2 = zx. Next, we can substitute this expression for y^2 into the first ratio to get y/(x - z) = (y + x)/z = x/zx^(1/2). Simplifying this expression, we get y = x^(3/2)/(x - z) and z = x^(1/2)/(x - z). Now, we can substitute these expressions for y and z into the ratio y^2 : x : z to get x^(3/2)/(x - z)^2 : x : x^(1/2)/(x - z). Simplifying this expression, we get x^(5/2) : x(x - z)^2 : x^(3/2)(x - z). Cancelling out an x from each term, we get x^(3/2) : (x - z)^2 : x^(1/2). Now, we can substitute the expression for z from earlier (z = x^(1/2)/(x - z)) into this ratio to get x^(3/2) : (x - x^(1/2))^2 : x^(1/2). Simplifying this expression, we get x^(3/2) : (x^2 - 2x^(3/2) + x) : x^(1/2). Finally, we can simplify the middle term by expanding the square and combining like terms to get x^(3/2) : (x^2 - 2x^(3/2) + x) : x^(1/2) = x^(3/2) : (x^2 - x^(3/2)) : x^(1/2) = x^(1/2) : (x - 1) : 1. Therefore, the answer is (E) none of these, since none of the given answer choices match the ratio x^(1/2) : (x - 1) : 1. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: what is summation of [3^k(28Ck)] (summation range 28 to k=0) where 28Ck is the number of ways of choosing k items from 28 items?? Answer Choices: (A) 4^28 (B) 4^27 (C) 4^26 (D) 4^25 (E) 4^24\nA: Let's think step by step. We can simplify the expression using the binomial theorem: (1 + 3)^28 = 28C0 * 3^0 + 28C1 * 3^1 + 28C2 * 3^2 + ... + 28C28 * 3^28 Notice that the expression we want to find is the same as the sum of the terms on the right-hand side of the equation above, except that we start the summation at k = 0 instead of k = 28. So we can write: summation of [3^k(28Ck)] (summation range 28 to k=0) = (1 + 3)^28 - 28C0 * 3^0 - 28C1 * 3^1 - 28C2 * 3^2 - ... - 28C27 * 3^27 We can simplify this expression by noticing that: (1 + 3)^28 = 4^28 And: 28C0 * 3^0 = 1 28C1 * 3^1 = 28 * 3 28C2 * 3^2 = 28 * 27 / 2 * 9 ... 28C27 * 3^27 = 28 * 27 * ... * 2 * 3^27 / 2^27 So we have: summation of [3^k(28Ck)] (summation range 28 to k=0) = 4^28 - 1 - 28 * 3 - 28 * 27 / 2 * 9 - ... - 28 * 27 * ... * 2 * 3^27 / 2^27 This expression can be simplified further, but we can already see that the answer is not any of the given options. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In the third grade of Windblown School there are 96 students, one third of them failed the math test and 1/6 failed that literature test. At least how many students failed both tests? Answer Choices: (A) 0. (B) 6. (C) 8. (D) 10. (E) 12.\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of students who failed the math test. One third of the 96 students failed the math test, so: 1/3 x 96 = 32 Therefore, 32 students failed the math test. Step 2: Find the number of students who failed the literature test. 1/6 of the 96 students failed the literature test, so: 1/6 x 96 = 16 Therefore, 16 students failed the literature test. Step 3: Find the number of students who failed both tests. We don't know the exact number of students who failed both tests, but we do know that it must be less than or equal to the smaller of the two numbers we just found (i.e. 16). Therefore, the answer is (B) 6, because that is the only option that is less than or equal to 16. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Primary batteries, unlike secondary batteries, may be: Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 7 (C) 6 (D) 8 (E) 9\nA: Let's think step by step. The question is asking for a characteristic that primary batteries have that secondary batteries do not have. Option (A) 2 is not a valid answer as it does not provide any information related to the question. Option (B) 7 is also not a valid answer as it does not provide any information related to the question. Option (C) 6 is also not a valid answer as it does not provide any information related to the question. Option (D) 8 is also not a valid answer as it does not provide any information related to the question. Option (E) 9 is also not a valid answer as it does not provide any information related to the question. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
