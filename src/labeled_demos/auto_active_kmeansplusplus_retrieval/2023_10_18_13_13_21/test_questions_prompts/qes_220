  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The average of temperatures at noontime from Monday to Friday is 40; the lowest one is 30, what is the possible maximum range of the temperatures? Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 25 (C) 50 (D) 45 (E) 75\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We know that the average temperature from Monday to Friday is 40. Let's call the sum of the temperatures for those five days \"S\". Then we can write: S/5 = 40 Multiplying both sides by 5, we get: S = 200 We also know that the lowest temperature is 30. Let's call the highest temperature \"H\". Then the range of temperatures is: H - 30 To find the maximum possible range, we need to find the maximum possible value of H. We know that the sum of the temperatures is 200, so: H + 4(40) = 200 Simplifying, we get: H = 40 So the maximum range of temperatures is: 40 - 30 = 10 Therefore, the answer is (A) 20. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Jamboree and GMAT Club Contest Starts\nQUESTION #20:\nHow many words (with or without meaning) can be formed using all the letters of the word \u201cSELFIE\u201d so that the two E\u2019s are not together? Answer Choices: (A)  660 (B)  600 (C)  500 (D)  300 (E)  240\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of ways to arrange all the letters of the word \"SELFIE\". This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken all at a time, which is n!. In this case, n = 6, so the total number of arrangements is 6! = 720. Next, we need to subtract the number of arrangements where the two E's are together. To do this, we can treat the two E's as a single object and find the number of arrangements of the five objects \"S\", \"L\", \"F\", \"I\", and \"EE\". This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is nPr = n!/(n-r)!. In this case, n = 5 and r = 5, so the number of arrangements where the two E's are together is 5! = 120. Finally, we can subtract the number of arrangements where the two E's are together from the total number of arrangements to get the number of arrangements where the two E's are not together: 720 - 120 = 600. Therefore, the answer is (B) 600. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A club with a total membership of 25 has formed 3 committees, M, S and R, which have 8, 12 and 5 members respectively. If no members of committee M is on either of the other 2 committees, what is the greatest possible number of members in the club who are on none of the committees? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 7 (C) 8 (D) 10 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of members who are on the committees. M has 8 members, S has 12 members, and R has 5 members. Since no members of M are on either of the other 2 committees, we can subtract the 8 members of M from the total number of committee members: Total committee members = 8 + 12 + 5 - 8 = 17 So, there are 17 members on the committees. To find the greatest possible number of members who are on none of the committees, we need to subtract this number from the total membership of the club: Greatest possible number of members not on committees = 25 - 17 = 8 Therefore, the answer is (C) 8. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A drink vendor has 60 liters of Maaza, 144 liters of Pepsi and 368 liters of Sprite. He wants to pack them in cans, so that each can contains the same number of liters of a drink, and doesn't want to mix any two drinks in a can. What is the least number of cans required? Answer Choices: (A) 135 (B) 137 (C) 143 (D) 310 (E) 380\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 60, 144, and 368 to determine the maximum number of liters that can be packed in a can. The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. The prime factorization of 144 is 2^4 * 3^2. The prime factorization of 368 is 2^4 * 23. The GCD of these three numbers is 12 (2^2 * 3). Therefore, each can can contain a maximum of 12 liters of a drink. To find the least number of cans required, we need to divide each quantity by 12 and round up to the nearest integer. 60/12 = 5 144/12 = 12 368/12 = 31 So we need at least 5 cans of Maaza, 12 cans of Pepsi, and 31 cans of Sprite. The total number of cans required is 5 + 12 + 31 = 48. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
