  "test_question": "Q: Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A man can row his boat with the stream at 18 km/h and against the stream in 8 km/h. The man's rate is? Answer Choices: (A) 5 kmph (B) 2 kmph (C) 7 kmph (D) 8 kmph (E) 3 kmph\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the speed of the stream be x km/h and the speed of the man be y km/h. When the man rows with the stream, his effective speed is (y + x) km/h. When the man rows against the stream, his effective speed is (y - x) km/h. We are given that: (y + x) = 18 km/h (y - x) = 8 km/h Adding the two equations, we get: 2y = 26 km/h y = 13 km/h Therefore, the man's rate is 13 km/h. The answer is not in the given options. Hence, the answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Three friends-whose walking rates are 1 ft./sec., 3ft./sec.,and 6ft./sec. start together walking in the same direction around a circular track that is 420 feet in circumference.After how many minutes are the three of them together again? Answer Choices: (A) 5 mins (B) 10 mins (C) 15 mins (D) 3 mins (E) 7 mins\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for each friend to complete one full lap around the track. We can use the formula: time = distance / rate For the friend with a walking rate of 1 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 1 ft./sec. = 420 sec. For the friend with a walking rate of 3 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 3 ft./sec. = 140 sec. For the friend with a walking rate of 6 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 6 ft./sec. = 70 sec. Now we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these three times, which will give us the time it takes for all three friends to be together again. The LCM of 420 sec., 140 sec., and 70 sec. is 420 sec. Converting 420 sec. to minutes, we get: 420 sec. / 60 sec./min. = 7 min. Therefore, the answer is (E) 7 mins. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Ricky likes to keep a spare tyre in his car every time. On a certain day, he travels 1, 00,000 km and just to make the most of all the tyres, he changes the tyres between his journey such that each tyre runs the same distance.\nWhat is the distance travelled by each tyre? Answer Choices: (A) 20000 (B) 35000 (C) 70000 (D) 60000 (E) 80000\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. Let's assume that Ricky has four tyres in total, including the spare tyre. Now, if he wants to make sure that each tyre runs the same distance, he needs to change the tyres after every 25% of the total distance travelled. So, 25% of 1,00,000 km is (25/100) x 1,00,000 = 25,000 km. Therefore, Ricky needs to change his tyres after every 25,000 km to ensure that each tyre runs the same distance. Hence, the distance travelled by each tyre is 25,000 km. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 20,000. (Note: The answer choices provided in the question are incorrect as none of them match the correct answer.) The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 25 copies per minute. A second copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 55 copies per minute. Working together at their respective rates, how many copies do the two machines make in half an hour ? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 2,400 (C) 4,500 (D) 5,400 (E) 324,000\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the combined rate of the two machines. To do this, we add their individual rates: 25 copies/minute + 55 copies/minute = 80 copies/minute Next, we need to convert half an hour to minutes: 30 minutes Now we can use the formula: rate x time = amount Plugging in the values we have: 80 copies/minute x 30 minutes = 2400 copies Therefore, the answer is (B) 2,400. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
