What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur? Answer Choices: (A) 0.22 (B) 0.26 (C) 0.37 (D) 0.46 (E) 0.63",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In a game, a person is declared winner, if he gets 4 consecutive tails in five throws of a coin. What is the probability of A to win if he has got a tail in the first throw? Answer Choices: (A) 1/5 (B) 1/4 (C) 1/8 (D) 1/16 (E) 1/6\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that A has already gotten a tail in the first throw. Now, in order to win, A needs to get 3 more consecutive tails in the next 4 throws. The probability of getting a tail in any given throw is 1/2 (assuming a fair coin). So, the probability of getting 4 consecutive tails in 5 throws can be calculated as follows: Probability = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/32 However, we need to take into account that A has already gotten a tail in the first throw. So, we only need to consider the probability of getting 3 consecutive tails in the next 4 throws. Probability = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16 Therefore, the probability of A winning if he has already gotten a tail in the first throw is 1/16. The correct answer is (D) 1/16. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: In the third grade of Windblown School there are 96 students, one third of them failed the math test and 1/6 failed that literature test. At least how many students failed both tests? Answer Choices: (A) 0. (B) 6. (C) 8. (D) 10. (E) 12.\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of students who failed the math test. One third of the 96 students failed the math test, so: 1/3 x 96 = 32 Therefore, 32 students failed the math test. Step 2: Find the number of students who failed the literature test. 1/6 of the 96 students failed the literature test, so: 1/6 x 96 = 16 Therefore, 16 students failed the literature test. Step 3: Find the number of students who failed both tests. We don't know the exact number of students who failed both tests, but we do know that it must be less than or equal to the smaller of the two numbers we just found (i.e. 16). Therefore, the answer is (B) 6, because that is the only option that is less than or equal to 16. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A and B enter into partnership with capital as 7:9. At the end of 8 months, A withdraws. If they receive the profits in the ratio of 8:9 find how long B's capital was used? Answer Choices: (A) 7 months (B) 3 months (C) 5 months (D) 8 months (E) 10 months\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. Let's assume that A invested 7x and B invested 9x. Since A withdraws after 8 months, he has invested for only 8 months. B's capital was used for the entire duration of the partnership, which we need to find. Let's assume that B's capital was used for y months. Now, we can calculate the ratio of profits that A and B receive: Profit ratio = (7x * 8) : (9x * y) Profit ratio = 56x : 9xy We know that the profit ratio is 8:9, so we can set up an equation: 56x : 9xy = 8 : 9 Cross-multiplying, we get: 504x = 72xy Simplifying, we get: 7x = y Therefore, B's capital was used for 7 months. The answer is (A) 7 months. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The C.P of 15 books is equal to the S.P of 18 books. Find his gain% or loss%? Answer Choices: (A) 16 2/3% (B) 16 2/8% (C) 16 7/3% (D) 16 5/3% (E) 16 6/3%\nA: Let's think step by step. Given, C.P of 15 books = S.P of 18 books Let the cost price of 1 book be x. Then, the cost price of 15 books = 15x And, the selling price of 18 books = 18x Now, we need to find the gain or loss percentage. Gain or Loss percentage = [(Selling price - Cost price) / Cost price] x 100 Since the selling price is greater than the cost price, there is a gain. Gain percentage = [(18x - 15x) / 15x] x 100 = (3x / 15x) x 100 = 20% Therefore, the answer is not in the given options. The correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
