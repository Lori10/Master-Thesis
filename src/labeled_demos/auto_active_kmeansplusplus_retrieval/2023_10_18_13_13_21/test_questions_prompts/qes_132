  "formatted_prompt": "Q: When sold at a 60% discount, a sweater nets the merchant a 20% profit on the wholesale cost at which he initially purchased the item. By what % is the sweater marked up from wholesale at its normal retail price? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 66.67% (D) 80% (E) 100%\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that the wholesale cost of the sweater is $100. If the merchant sells the sweater at a 60% discount, he sells it for 40% of the original price, which is $40. Now, we know that the merchant makes a 20% profit on the wholesale cost at which he initially purchased the item. So, the cost price for the merchant is $100, and he makes a profit of 20%, which is $20. Therefore, the selling price for the merchant is $120. We can now calculate the markup percentage from the wholesale price to the normal retail price. Markup percentage = (Selling price - Wholesale price) / Wholesale price x 100% Markup percentage = ($120 - $100) / $100 x 100% Markup percentage = 20% Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 20%. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Gautami went to the stationers and bought things worth Rs. 100, out of which 50 paise went on sales tax on taxable purchases. If the tax rate was 5%. then what was the cost of the tax free items? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 99.50 (B) Rs. 70.50 (C) Rs. 89.50 (D) Rs. 69.50 (E) Rs. 80.50\nA: Let's think step by step. The total cost of the items including tax is Rs. 100. Out of this, 50 paise (or Rs. 0.50) went on sales tax. We know that the tax rate is 5%. So, we can set up an equation: 5% of the taxable purchases = Rs. 0.50 To find the cost of tax-free items, we need to subtract the tax amount from the total cost: Cost of tax-free items = Total cost - Tax amount Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 100 - Rs. 0.50 Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 99.50 Therefore, the answer is (A) Rs. 99.50. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A camera lens filter kit containing 5 filters sells for $52.50. If the filters are purchased individually, 2 of them are priced at $6.45 each, 2 at $11.05 each, 1 at $15.50. The amount saved by purchasing the kit is what percent of the total price of the 5 filters purchased individually? Answer Choices: (A) 3.76% (B) 4.76% (C) 5.76% (D) 6.76% (E) 7.76%\nA: Let's think step by step. The total cost of purchasing the filters individually is: 2 x $6.45 + 2 x $11.05 + $15.50 = $31.50 The cost of purchasing the kit is $52.50. The amount saved by purchasing the kit is: $31.50 - $52.50 = -$21.00 This means that purchasing the kit costs $21.00 more than purchasing the filters individually. To find the percentage of the total price saved by purchasing the kit, we need to divide the amount saved by the total cost of purchasing the filters individually and then multiply by 100: (-$21.00 / $31.50) x 100 = -66.67% This means that purchasing the kit costs 66.67% more than purchasing the filters individually. However, the question asks for the percentage of the total price saved, not the percentage of the total price increased. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: The average price of an antique car increases over the years. If from 1990 to 1996, the price of the car increased by 13% and from 1996 to 2001 it increased by 20%, what is the price of the car in 2001 if the price in 1990 was $11,500? Answer Choices: (A) $15,594. (B) $15,322. (C) $14,786. (D) $14,543. (E) $12,988.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the price of the car in 1996 after a 13% increase from 1990. Price in 1990 = $11,500 13% increase from 1990 = 0.13 x $11,500 = $1,495 Price in 1996 = $11,500 + $1,495 = $12,995 Next, we need to find the price of the car in 2001 after a 20% increase from 1996. 20% increase from 1996 = 0.20 x $12,995 = $2,599 Price in 2001 = $12,995 + $2,599 = $15,594 Therefore, the answer is (A) $15,594. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
