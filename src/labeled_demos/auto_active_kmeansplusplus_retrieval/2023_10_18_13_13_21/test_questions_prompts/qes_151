  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In the third grade of Windblown School there are 96 students, one third of them failed the math test and 1/6 failed that literature test. At least how many students failed both tests? Answer Choices: (A) 0. (B) 6. (C) 8. (D) 10. (E) 12.\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of students who failed the math test. One third of the 96 students failed the math test, so: 1/3 x 96 = 32 Therefore, 32 students failed the math test. Step 2: Find the number of students who failed the literature test. 1/6 of the 96 students failed the literature test, so: 1/6 x 96 = 16 Therefore, 16 students failed the literature test. Step 3: Find the number of students who failed both tests. We don't know the exact number of students who failed both tests, but we do know that it must be less than or equal to the smaller of the two numbers we just found (i.e. 16). Therefore, the answer is (B) 6, because that is the only option that is less than or equal to 16. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Salad dressing P is made up of 30% vinegar and 70% oil, and salad dressing Q contains 10% vinegar and 90% oil. If the two dressings are combined to produce a salad dressing that is 12% vinegar, dressing P comprises what percentage of the new dressing? Answer Choices: (A) 50% (B) 40% (C) 30% (D) 20% (E) 10%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that we have 100 ml of the new salad dressing. Let x be the percentage of dressing P in the new dressing. Then, we can write: - The amount of vinegar in dressing P = 30% of x ml - The amount of vinegar in dressing Q = 10% of (100 - x) ml (since the total amount of dressing is 100 ml and we have x ml of dressing P) - The amount of vinegar in the new dressing = 12% of 100 ml = 12 ml Since we are combining the two dressings, the total amount of vinegar in the new dressing is the sum of the amount of vinegar in dressing P and dressing Q. So, we can write: 0.3x + 0.1(100 - x) = 12 Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.2x + 10 = 12 0.2x = 2 x = 10 Therefore, dressing P comprises 10% of the new dressing. The correct answer is (E) 10%. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Of the 600 residents of Clermontville, 35% watch the television show Island Survival, 40% watch Lovelost Lawyers and 50% watch Medical Emergency. If all residents watch at least one of these three shows and 18% watch exactly 2 of these shows, then how many Clermontville residents B watch all of the shows? Answer Choices: (A)  150 (B)  108 (C)  42 (D)  21 (E)  -21\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of residents who watch at least one of the three shows. 35% + 40% + 50% = 125% This means that some residents are being counted twice or even thrice. To find the actual percentage, we need to subtract the percentage of residents who watch exactly two shows and the percentage of residents who watch all three shows. Step 2: Find the percentage of residents who watch exactly two shows. 125% - 18% = 107% Step 3: Find the percentage of residents who watch all three shows. 107% - 100% = 7% Step 4: Find the total number of residents who watch all three shows. 7% of 600 = 42 Therefore, the answer is (C) 42. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: On a certain transatlantic crossing, 40 percent of a ship\u2019s passengers held round-trip tickets and also took their cars abroad the ship. If 50 percent of the passengers with round-trip tickets did not take their cars abroad the ship, what percent of the ship\u2019s passengers held round-trip tickets? Answer Choices: (A) 40% (B) 50% (C) 60% (D) 80% (E) 90%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that there are 100 passengers on the ship. 40% of the passengers held round-trip tickets and took their cars abroad the ship, which means there are 40 passengers who fit this description. Now, we know that 50% of the passengers with round-trip tickets did not take their cars abroad the ship. So, out of the 40 passengers with round-trip tickets, 50% did not take their cars, which means 20 passengers did not take their cars. Therefore, the remaining 20 passengers with round-trip tickets did take their cars abroad the ship. To find the percentage of passengers with round-trip tickets, we divide the total number of passengers (100) into the number of passengers with round-trip tickets (40). 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%. So, the answer is (A) 40%. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
