  "test_question": "Q: The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: When sold at a 60% discount, a sweater nets the merchant a 20% profit on the wholesale cost at which he initially purchased the item. By what % is the sweater marked up from wholesale at its normal retail price? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 66.67% (D) 80% (E) 100%\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that the wholesale cost of the sweater is $100. If the merchant sells the sweater at a 60% discount, he sells it for 40% of the original price, which is $40. Now, we know that the merchant makes a 20% profit on the wholesale cost at which he initially purchased the item. So, the cost price for the merchant is $100, and he makes a profit of 20%, which is $20. Therefore, the selling price for the merchant is $120. We can now calculate the markup percentage from the wholesale price to the normal retail price. Markup percentage = (Selling price - Wholesale price) / Wholesale price x 100% Markup percentage = ($120 - $100) / $100 x 100% Markup percentage = 20% Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 20%. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The C.P of 15 books is equal to the S.P of 18 books. Find his gain% or loss%? Answer Choices: (A) 16 2/3% (B) 16 2/8% (C) 16 7/3% (D) 16 5/3% (E) 16 6/3%\nA: Let's think step by step. Given, C.P of 15 books = S.P of 18 books Let the cost price of 1 book be x. Then, the cost price of 15 books = 15x And, the selling price of 18 books = 18x Now, we need to find the gain or loss percentage. Gain or Loss percentage = [(Selling price - Cost price) / Cost price] x 100 Since the selling price is greater than the cost price, there is a gain. Gain percentage = [(18x - 15x) / 15x] x 100 = (3x / 15x) x 100 = 20% Therefore, the answer is not in the given options. The correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A camera lens filter kit containing 5 filters sells for $52.50. If the filters are purchased individually, 2 of them are priced at $6.45 each, 2 at $11.05 each, 1 at $15.50. The amount saved by purchasing the kit is what percent of the total price of the 5 filters purchased individually? Answer Choices: (A) 3.76% (B) 4.76% (C) 5.76% (D) 6.76% (E) 7.76%\nA: Let's think step by step. The total cost of purchasing the filters individually is: 2 x $6.45 + 2 x $11.05 + $15.50 = $31.50 The cost of purchasing the kit is $52.50. The amount saved by purchasing the kit is: $31.50 - $52.50 = -$21.00 This means that purchasing the kit costs $21.00 more than purchasing the filters individually. To find the percentage of the total price saved by purchasing the kit, we need to divide the amount saved by the total cost of purchasing the filters individually and then multiply by 100: (-$21.00 / $31.50) x 100 = -66.67% This means that purchasing the kit costs 66.67% more than purchasing the filters individually. However, the question asks for the percentage of the total price saved, not the percentage of the total price increased. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: Salad dressing P is made up of 30% vinegar and 70% oil, and salad dressing Q contains 10% vinegar and 90% oil. If the two dressings are combined to produce a salad dressing that is 12% vinegar, dressing P comprises what percentage of the new dressing? Answer Choices: (A) 50% (B) 40% (C) 30% (D) 20% (E) 10%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that we have 100 ml of the new salad dressing. Let x be the percentage of dressing P in the new dressing. Then, we can write: - The amount of vinegar in dressing P = 30% of x ml - The amount of vinegar in dressing Q = 10% of (100 - x) ml (since the total amount of dressing is 100 ml and we have x ml of dressing P) - The amount of vinegar in the new dressing = 12% of 100 ml = 12 ml Since we are combining the two dressings, the total amount of vinegar in the new dressing is the sum of the amount of vinegar in dressing P and dressing Q. So, we can write: 0.3x + 0.1(100 - x) = 12 Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.2x + 10 = 12 0.2x = 2 x = 10 Therefore, dressing P comprises 10% of the new dressing. The correct answer is (E) 10%. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
