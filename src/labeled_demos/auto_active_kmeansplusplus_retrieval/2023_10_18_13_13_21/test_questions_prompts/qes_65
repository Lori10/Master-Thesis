  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A number is said to be prime saturated if the product of all the different positive prime factors of e is less than the square root of e. What is the greatest two digit prime saturated integer ? Answer Choices: (A) 99 (B) 98 (C) 97 (D) 96 (E) 95\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. First, we need to find all the prime factors of a number. Second, we need to find the product of all the different prime factors. Third, we need to compare this product with the square root of the number. Fourth, we need to repeat this process for all two-digit numbers and find the greatest prime saturated integer. Let's start with the first step. The prime numbers less than or equal to 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Any two-digit number that is not divisible by these primes is not prime saturated. Let's try 98. The prime factors of 98 are 2 and 7. The product of these primes is 14, which is less than the square root of 98 (which is approximately 9.9). Therefore, 98 is prime saturated. Let's try 99. The prime factors of 99 are 3 and 11. The product of these primes is 33, which is greater than the square root of 99 (which is approximately 9.95). Therefore, 99 is not prime saturated. Let's try 97. 97 is a prime number, so its only prime factor is itself. The product of this prime is 97, which is less than the square root of 97 (which is approximately 9.85). Therefore, 97 is prime saturated. Let's try 96. The prime factors of 96 are 2, 3, and 5. The product of these primes is 30, which is less than the square root of 96 (which is approximately 9.8). Therefore, 96 is prime saturated. Let's try 95. The prime factors of 95 are 5 and 19. The product of these primes is 95, which is equal to the square root of 95. Therefore, 95 is not prime saturated. Therefore, the greatest prime saturated two-digit integer is 98, which is option (B). The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Find the odd man out. 187, 264, 316, 473, 682, 781 Answer Choices: (A) 187 (B) 316 (C) 781 (D) 682 (E) 473\nA: Let's think step by step. The numbers seem random, so we need to find a pattern or rule that applies to all except one of the numbers. If we look at the last digit of each number, we can see that they alternate between odd and even: 7, 4, 6, 3, 2, 1. However, this pattern doesn't apply to 316, which ends in an even digit. Therefore, the odd man out is (B) 316. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A drink vendor has 60 liters of Maaza, 144 liters of Pepsi and 368 liters of Sprite. He wants to pack them in cans, so that each can contains the same number of liters of a drink, and doesn't want to mix any two drinks in a can. What is the least number of cans required? Answer Choices: (A) 135 (B) 137 (C) 143 (D) 310 (E) 380\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 60, 144, and 368 to determine the maximum number of liters that can be packed in a can. The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. The prime factorization of 144 is 2^4 * 3^2. The prime factorization of 368 is 2^4 * 23. The GCD of these three numbers is 12 (2^2 * 3). Therefore, each can can contain a maximum of 12 liters of a drink. To find the least number of cans required, we need to divide each quantity by 12 and round up to the nearest integer. 60/12 = 5 144/12 = 12 368/12 = 31 So we need at least 5 cans of Maaza, 12 cans of Pepsi, and 31 cans of Sprite. The total number of cans required is 5 + 12 + 31 = 48. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A club with a total membership of 25 has formed 3 committees, M, S and R, which have 8, 12 and 5 members respectively. If no members of committee M is on either of the other 2 committees, what is the greatest possible number of members in the club who are on none of the committees? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 7 (C) 8 (D) 10 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of members who are on the committees. M has 8 members, S has 12 members, and R has 5 members. Since no members of M are on either of the other 2 committees, we can subtract the 8 members of M from the total number of committee members: Total committee members = 8 + 12 + 5 - 8 = 17 So, there are 17 members on the committees. To find the greatest possible number of members who are on none of the committees, we need to subtract this number from the total membership of the club: Greatest possible number of members not on committees = 25 - 17 = 8 Therefore, the answer is (C) 8. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
