  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Bart makes a mixtape.  The first side has 6 songs.  The second side has 4 songs.  Each song is 4 minutes.  How long is the total tape?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThere are 6+4=<<6+4=10>>10 songs on the tape.\nIn total, the time is 10*4=<<10*4=40>>40 minutes. The answer is 40.\n\n\nQ: Mitzel spent 35% of her allowance. If she spent $14, how much money is left in her allowance?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nIf 35% represents 14, then 100-35 = 65 represents the amount left of her allowance.\nThe amount she didn't use is 65*14/35 = <<65*14/35=26>>26 The answer is 26.\n\n\nQ: Mr. Maximilian has a rental building that he collects rent from every month. The number of units in the building is 100. If the building is 3/4 occupied for a whole year, and each resident of the building pays a rent of $400, calculate the amount of money Mr. Maximilian receives in that year.\nA: Let's think step by step.\nSince there are 100 units, the number of units occupied by tenants is 3/4 * 100 = <<3/4*100=75>>75\nIf each tenant pays $400 every month, Mr Maximilian receives 75 * $400 = $<<75*400=30000>>30000 in rent revenue every month.\nIn a year, Mr Maximilian receives $30000 * 12 = $<<30000*12=360000>>360000 in rent revenue. The answer is 360000.\n\n\n"
