  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Brady will make $450 more in a year than Dwayne. If Dwayne makes $1,500 in a year, how much will Brady and Dwayne make combined in a year?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nBrady will make $450 + $1500 = $<<450+1500=1950>>1950.\nCombined, Brady and Dwayne will make $1950 + $1500 = $<<1950+1500=3450>>3450 in a year. The answer is 3450.\n\n\nQ: Mr. Maximilian has a rental building that he collects rent from every month. The number of units in the building is 100. If the building is 3/4 occupied for a whole year, and each resident of the building pays a rent of $400, calculate the amount of money Mr. Maximilian receives in that year.\nA: Let's think step by step.\nSince there are 100 units, the number of units occupied by tenants is 3/4 * 100 = <<3/4*100=75>>75\nIf each tenant pays $400 every month, Mr Maximilian receives 75 * $400 = $<<75*400=30000>>30000 in rent revenue every month.\nIn a year, Mr Maximilian receives $30000 * 12 = $<<30000*12=360000>>360000 in rent revenue. The answer is 360000.\n\n\nQ: Bart makes a mixtape.  The first side has 6 songs.  The second side has 4 songs.  Each song is 4 minutes.
