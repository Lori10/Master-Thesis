And each time he fires his weapon, his power-fire setting allows him to shoot a flame for 5 seconds.  On average, how many seconds per minute does Jason shoot flames at the dragon hoard?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nSince he fires his weapon on average every 15 seconds, then in one minute he fires the flamethrower 60/15=<<60/15=4>>4 times.\nAnd since each time he fires his weapon, he shoots flame for 5 seconds, then Jason shoots flames at the dragon hoard a total of 4*5=<<4*5=20>>20 seconds of every minute.",

If the building is 3/4 occupied for a whole year, and each resident of the building pays a rent of $400, calculate the amount of money Mr. Maximilian receives in that year.",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nSince there are 100 units, the number of units occupied by tenants is 3/4 * 100 = <<3/4*100=75>>75\nIf each tenant pays $400 every month, Mr Maximilian receives 75 * $400 = $<<75*400=30000>>30000 in rent revenue every month.\nIn a year, Mr Maximilian receives $30000 * 12 = $<<30000*12=360000>>360000 in rent revenue.",
