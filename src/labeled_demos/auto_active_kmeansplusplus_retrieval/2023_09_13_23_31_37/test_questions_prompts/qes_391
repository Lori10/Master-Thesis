  "test_question": "Q: A watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons. Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found out that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so she took them home. When she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so she harvested them. How many melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: An apple tree has three times as many apples as the number of plums on a plum tree. If Damien picks 3/5 of the fruits from the trees, calculate the total number of plums and apples remaining on the tree if there were 180 apples on the apple tree before Damien picked any of the fruits.\nA: Let's think step by step. Initially, the were 180//3= <<180//3=60>>60 plums on the plum tree. When Damien picked 3/5 of the apples from the apple tree, he picked 3/5*180 = <<3/5*180=108>>108 apples The number of apples remaining on the apple tree is 180-108= <<180-108=72>>72 The number of plums that Damien picked from the plum tree is 3/5*60 = <<3/5*60=36>>36 The number of plums remaining on the plum tree is 60-36 = <<60-36=24>>24 The total number of fruits remaining on the trees is 72 apples+24 plums = <<72+24=96>>96 The answer is 96.\n\n\nQ: Bea's mom planted 50 Mahogany and 30 Narra trees on their farm. Due to a typhoon, a total of 5 trees fell. One more Mahogany tree fell than the number of Narra trees that fell. A month after the typhoon, Bea's mom planted twice as much as the number of the Narra and thrice the number of Mahogany trees that fell. How many trees are now on the farm?\nA: Let's think step by step. Before the typhoon, their farm had a total of 50 trees + 30 trees = <<50+30=80>>80 trees. If there was 1 more than Mahogany than Narra tree that fell, then this means there were 2 Narra trees and 2 + 1 = 3 Mahogany trees that fell during the typhoon. So, Bea's mom planted 2 trees x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 Narra trees. She also planted 3 trees x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 Mahogany trees. So, her mom planted 4 trees + 9 trees = <<4+9=13>>13 more trees. After the typhoon, they only had 80 trees - 5 trees = <<80-5=75>>75 trees left. Therefore, there are 75 trees + 13 trees = <<75+13=88>>88 trees now. The answer is 88.\n\n\nQ: Hazel put up a lemonade stand. She sold half her lemonade to a construction crew. She sold 18 cups to kids on bikes. She gave away half that amount to her friends. Then she drank the last cup of lemonade herself. How many cups of lemonade did Hazel make?\nA: Let's think step by step. Hazel sold 18 cups of lemonade to kids on bikes and gave half that amount, or 18 / 2 = <<18/2=9>>9 cups, away to friends. Hazel sold 18 cups + gave away 9 cups + drank 1 cup = <<18+9+1=28>>28 cups. Since Hazel sold half her lemonade to a construction crew, that means the 28 cups she sold to kids on bikes, gave away to friends and drank herself are the other half, so she sold 28 cups to the construction crew. In all, Hazel sold 28 + 28 = <<28+28=56>>56 cups of lemonade. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Aimee does a poll around her neighborhood and makes sure to get answers from 50% men and 50% women. She finds that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. How many people did she poll?\nA: Let's think step by step. 65% of women are opposed to the idea because 100 - 35 = <<100-35=65>>65 There are 60 women in the poll because 39 / .65 = <<39/.65=60>>60 There were 120 people in her poll because 60 / .5 = <<60/.5=120>>120 The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. 20% of her 40 students will bring their own life vest so .20*40 = <<.20*40=8>>8 students will bring their life vests Alice has 20 life vests and 8 students will bring there's so that's 20+8 = <<20+8=28>>28 life vests There are 40 students and 10 instructors total so that's 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 people in the class If there are 28 life vests and she has 50 people then she needs to find 50-28 = 22 more life vests The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Mr. McNeely takes a register of the total number of students present in class every day. On a particular week, the number of students in the class on the second day was 40 more than the first day. The number of students who didn't turn up for the class on the second day was twice the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day. On the third day, 1/7 of the total number of students of the class called in sick. If the total number of students in the class is 280, calculate the number of absent students in the three days.\nA: Let's think step by step. On the third day, 1/7*280 = <<1/7*280=40>>40 students called in sick. If the number of students absent on the second day was twice the number on the third day, then 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80 students didn't show up for the class on the second day. The total number of students present in the class on the second day was 280-80= <<280-80=200>>200. If 40 fewer students showed up for the class on the first day than on the second day, then 200-40 = <<200-40=160>>160 students showed up for the class on the first day. The number of students absent on the first day is 280-160 = <<280-160=120>>120 In the three days, the total number of absentees is 120+80+40 = <<120+80+40=240>>240 The answer is 240.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First subtract the 7 double-counted animals from Mary's total: 60 animals - 7 animals = <<60-7=53>>53 animals Then add the animals she missed to find the real total: 53 animals + 3 pigs = <<53+3=56>>56 animals The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Alyssa took 100 photos on vacation. She wants to put them in a photo album with 30 pages. She can place 3 photos each on the first 10 pages. Then she can place 4 photos each on the next 10 pages. If she wants to put an equal number of photos on each of the remaining pages of the album, how many photos can she place on each page?\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 3 x 10 = <<3*10=30>>30 photos in total that can be placed in the first 10 pages. There are 4 x 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 photos in total that can be placed in the next 10 pages. A total of 10 + 10 = <<10+10=20>>20 pages of the album have been used. A total of 30 + 40 = <<30+40=70>>70 photos can be placed on those 20 pages. So there are still 100 - 70 = <<100-70=30>>30 photos left to be placed on the album. And there are 30 - 20 = <<30-20=10>>10 pages left in the album. Therefore, 30/10 = <<30/10=3>>3 photos can be placed on each of the pages. The answer is 3.\n\n\n"
