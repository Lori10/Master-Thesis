  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Hank reads the newspaper every morning, 5 days a week for 30 minutes.  He reads part of a novel every evening, 5 days a week, for 1 hour.  He doubles his reading time on Saturday and Sundays.  How many minutes does Hank spend reading in 1 week?\nA: Let's think step by step. He reads 30 minutes in the morning 5 days a week for a total of 30*5 = <<30*5=150>>150 minutes He doubles his reading time on the weekends so 30*2 = <<30*2=60>>60 minutes per day He reads 60 minutes on Saturday and Sunday in the mornings for a total of 60+60 = <<60+60=120>>120 minutes He reads 1 hour in the evenings 5 days a week for a total of 1*5 = <<1*5=5>>5 hours He doubles his reading time on the weekends so 1*2 = <<1*2=2>>2 hours per day He reads 2 hours on Saturday and Sunday in the evenings for a total of 2+2 = <<2+2=4>>4 hours He read 5+4 = 9 hours which, when converted to minutes is 9*60 = 540 minutes He reads 150 minutes in the morning and 120 minutes in the evenings and 540 over the weekend for a total of 150+120+540 = 810 minutes in 1 week The answer is 810.\n\n\nQ: Ryan works in an office that has an even number of men and women working there.  Ryan participates in a meeting composed of 4 men and 6 women who are pulled from the office floor.   This reduces the number of women working on the office floor by 20%.  How many people work at Ryan's office?\nA: Let's think step by step. Since 6 women are 20% of the total number of women working there, that means there are 6*5= <<6*5=30>>30 women working there in total. Since there are an even number of women and men working in the office, that means there are 30*2= <<30*2=60>>60 people working there in total, since there are 2 sexes. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Janice can type 6 sentences per minute. Today at work, Janice continued working on a paper she started typing yesterday. She typed for 20 minutes, took a break, and typed 15 minutes longer. She then had to erase 40 sentences she had typed incorrectly. After a meeting, she typed for 18 minutes more. In all, the paper had 536 sentences by the end of today. How many sentences did she start with today?\nA: Let's think step by step. Janice had X sentences from yesterday already typed to start with today. Janice typed 6 * 20 = <<6*20=120>>120 sentences before her break. She typed 6 * 15 = <<6*15=90>>90 sentences after her break. She typed 6 * 18 = <<6*18=108>>108 sentences after her meeting. Therefore, she typed 120 + 90 + 108 = <<120+90+108=318>>318 sentences today in all. She had to erase 40 sentences, so she had 318 - 40 = <<318-40=278>>278 sentences that she typed today left. The paper had X + 278 = 536 sentences at the end of today. Thus, she had X = 536 - 278 = <<536-278=258>>258 sentences typed on the paper to start with today. The answer is 258.\n\n\nQ: Tim drinks 2 bottles that are each 1.5 quarts and an additional 20 ounces a day.  How much water does he drink a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. The bottles are 1.5*32=<<1.5*32=48>>48 ounces So he drinks 48*2=<<48*2=96>>96 ounces from the bottles So in total he drank 96+20=<<96+20=116>>116 ounces a day 116*7=<<116*7=812>>812 ounces a week The answer is 812.\n\n\nQ: Carlos and Diego are racing around the block. Carlos runs around the entire block in 3 minutes. Diego runs around half the block in 2.5 minutes and then is tripped by a dog and can't finish. Assuming he kept up the same speed the entire race, what would've been the average time in seconds for the racers?\nA: Let's think step by step. If he finished the race, it would've taken 5 minutes because 2.5 x 2 = <<2.5*2=5>>5 Their total time would've been 8 minutes because 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 The average would've been 4 minutes because 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 The average time in seconds would've been 240 because 4 x 60 = <<4*60=240>>240 The answer is 240.\n\n\nQ: Aimee does a poll around her neighborhood and makes sure to get answers from 50% men and 50% women. She finds that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. How many people did she poll?\nA: Let's think step by step. 65% of women are opposed to the idea because 100 - 35 = <<100-35=65>>65 There are 60 women in the poll because 39 / .65 = <<39/.65=60>>60 There were 120 people in her poll because 60 / .5 = <<60/.5=120>>120 The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: James wants to build a ladder to climb a very tall tree.  Each rung of the ladder is 18 inches long and they are 6 inches apart.  If he needs to climb 50 feet how many feet of wood will he need for the rungs?\nA: Let's think step by step. He needs 12/6=<<12/6=2>>2 rungs per foot So he needs 50*2=<<50*2=100>>100 rungs Each rung is 18/12=<<18/12=1.5>>1.5 feet So he needs 1.5*100=<<1.5*100=150>>150 feet The answer is 150.\n\n\nQ: Emery's family decides to travel for a weekend trip. They drive the first 100 miles in 1 hour. They stop at a McDonald's and then continue the rest of the journey for 300 miles. What's the total number of hours they traveled?\nA: Let's think step by step. If the first 100 miles took one hour, then let's say the next 300 miles took x hours. if 100 miles = 1 hour, then 300 miles =x. To find the number of hours traveled for the 300 miles, x = 300*1/100 x= <<3=3>>3 hours. The total number of hours will be 3 +1 = <<3+1=4>>4 hours The answer is 4.\n\n\n"
