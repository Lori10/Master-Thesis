  "test_question": "Q: Twenty students are working together to raise money for a charity. Each earns the same amount. The charity raises a total of $175,000. $50,000 comes from organizations and the rest from the students. How much did each student raise?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Logan makes $65,000 a year. He spends $20,000 on rent every year, $5000 on groceries every year, and $8000 on gas every year. If he wants to have at least $42000 left, how much more money must he make each year?\nA: Let's think step by step. Logan spends 20000+5000+8000 = <<20000+5000+8000=33000>>33000 a year. Logan has 65000-33000 = <<65000-33000=32000>>32000 left a year. Logan needs to make 42000-32000 = <<42000-32000=10000>>10000 more a year. The answer is 10000.\n\n\nQ: The ratio of the amount of money Cara, Janet, and Jerry have is 4:5:6. If the total amount of money they have is $75, calculate the loss Cara and Janet will make if they combine their money to buy oranges and sell them at 80% of the buying price.\nA: Let's think step by step. The sum of the ratios representing the amount of money the three has is 4+5+6=<<4+5+6=15>>15 If the total amount of money they have is $75, the amount of money Cara has represented by the fraction 4/15 is 4/15*$75=$<<4/15*75=20>>20 Similarly, the amount of money Janet has represented by the fraction 5/15 of the total ratio is 5/15*$75=$<<5/15*75=25>>25 Combined, Cara and Janet have $20+25=$<<20+25=45>>45 If Cara and Janet buy goods worth $45 and sells them at 80% of the buying price, the selling price of the goods will be 80/100*$45=$<<45*80/100=36>>36 Since they bought the goods at $45 and sold them at $36, Janet and Cara would run at a loss of $45-$36=$<<45-36=9>>9 The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Selina is selling some of her old clothes to a second-hand store. They will buy her pants for $5 each, her shorts for $3 each, and her shirts for $4 each. She sells 3 pairs of pants, 5 pairs of shorts, and some shirts. After she gets her money, she sees 2 shirts that she likes which cost $10 each and buys them. She leaves the store with $30. How many shirts did she sell to the store?\nA: Let's think step by step. The shirts she bought cost her $20 because 2 x 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 She earned $50 selling her clothes because 20 + 30 = <<20+30=50>>50 She made $15 off pants because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 She made 15 dollars from shorts because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 She made $20 off shirts because 50 - 15 - 15 = <<50-15-15=20>>20 She sold 5 shirts because 20 / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: An elementary school teacher is making Halloween goodie bags for her class.  She wants the bags to be personalized, so she surveys her students asking whether they'd like a vampire-themed bag or a pumpkin-themed bag.  Of her 25 students, 11 indicate they want the vampire-themed bag and 14 indicate they want the pumpkin-themed bag.  The store the teacher shops at sells packs of 5 of each theme at a price of $3 per package, as well as individual bags of each theme at a price of $1 each.  What is the least amount of money the teacher can spend on the bags if she buys every student the theme they requested?\nA: Let's think step by step. Because it is cheaper to buy the packs of 5, the teacher should satisfy the 11 students who want the vampire theme with 2 packs of 5 and 1 individual bag. This will cost the teacher 2*3 + 1*1 = $<<2*3+1*1=7>>7. Similarly, the 14 students who want a pumpkin-themed bag can be satisfied by 2 packs of 5 and 4 individual bags at a cost of 2*3 + 4*1 = $<<2*3+4*1=10>>10. Therefore, the teacher must spend 7 + 10 = $<<7+10=17>>17. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Steve has a bank account that earns 10% interest every year. He puts $100 in it, and then 10 each year. How much money is in it after two years?\nA: Let's think step by step. After one year it earns $10 in interest because 100 x .1 = <<100*.1=10>>10 It has $120 in it after a year because 100 + 10 + 10 = <<100+10+10=120>>120 In the second year it earns $12 in interest because 120 x .1 = <<120*.1=12>>12 In the second year it has $142 in it because 120 + 12 + 10 = <<120+12+10=142>>142 The answer is 142.\n\n\nQ: Harrison Elementary School is overcrowded with 1590 students, so 40% of the students are going to move to a new school. There are 3 grade levels, and each grade level needs one 20-person advanced class and the rest of the students divided evenly into 6 additional classes. How many students will there be in each normal class at the new school?\nA: Let's think step by step. First find how many students go to the new school: 1590 students * .4 = <<1590*.4=636>>636 students Then divide that number by 3 to find how many students are at each grade level: 636 students / 3 grades = <<636/3=212>>212 students/grade Then subtract the 20 students in the gifted class: 212 students - 20 students = <<212-20=192>>192 students Then divide that number by 6 to find the number of students in each other class: 192 students / 6 classes = <<192/6=32>>32 students/class The answer is 32.\n\n\nQ: Gwen received a $900 bonus at work and decided to invest this money in the stock market.  She spent one-third of her bonus on stock A, one-third on stock B, and the remaining one-third on stock C.   After one year, stock A and stock B had doubled in value, while stock C had lost half of its value.  At the end of the year, how much were Gwen's stocks worth, in dollars?\nA: Let's think step by step. One-third of her bonus was $900/3 = $<<900/3=300>>300. After one year, stock A doubled in value and was worth $300*2 = $<<300*2=600>>600. After one year, stock B doubled in value and was worth $300*2 = $<<300*2=600>>600. After one year, stock C had lost half its value and was worth $300/2 = $<<300/2=150>>150. Altogether, at the end of the year, Gwen's stocks were worth $600+$600+$150 = $<<600+600+150=1350>>1350 The answer is 1350.\n\n\nQ: Samuel is going to the cinema with his brother, Kevin. They both have a total budget of $20 for their outing. Samuel buys his $14 ticket, then spends $6 on drinks and food. Kevin buys his ticket, then spends $2 on drinks. They have both used their entire budget. How much did Kevin spend on food?\nA: Let's think step by step. We know Kevin bought a ticket and drinks, and this cost him 14 + 2 = <<14+2=16>>16 dollars. Since Kevin spent his entire budget, his food must have cost 20 \u2013 16 = <<20-16=4>>4 dollars. The answer is 4.\n\n\n"
