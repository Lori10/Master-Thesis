  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Bertha wears out 20 / 10 = <<20/10=2>>2 tennis balls in 20 games. She loses 20 / 5 = <<20/5=4>>4 tennis balls in 20 games. She buys canisters of 3 * 20 / 4 = <<3*20/4=15>>15 tennis balls in 20 games. Bertha started with 2 balls and gave 1 away, so she has 2 + 15 - 2 - 4 - 1 = <<2+15-2-4-1=10>>10 tennis balls after twenty games. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Janice can type 6 sentences per minute. Today at work, Janice continued working on a paper she started typing yesterday. She typed for 20 minutes, took a break, and typed 15 minutes longer. She then had to erase 40 sentences she had typed incorrectly. After a meeting, she typed for 18 minutes more. In all, the paper had 536 sentences by the end of today. How many sentences did she start with today?\nA: Let's think step by step. Janice had X sentences from yesterday already typed to start with today. Janice typed 6 * 20 = <<6*20=120>>120 sentences before her break. She typed 6 * 15 = <<6*15=90>>90 sentences after her break. She typed 6 * 18 = <<6*18=108>>108 sentences after her meeting. Therefore, she typed 120 + 90 + 108 = <<120+90+108=318>>318 sentences today in all. She had to erase 40 sentences, so she had 318 - 40 = <<318-40=278>>278 sentences that she typed today left. The paper had X + 278 = 536 sentences at the end of today. Thus, she had X = 536 - 278 = <<536-278=258>>258 sentences typed on the paper to start with today. The answer is 258.\n\n\nQ: Aimee does a poll around her neighborhood and makes sure to get answers from 50% men and 50% women. She finds that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. How many people did she poll?\nA: Let's think step by step. 65% of women are opposed to the idea because 100 - 35 = <<100-35=65>>65 There are 60 women in the poll because 39 / .65 = <<39/.65=60>>60 There were 120 people in her poll because 60 / .5 = <<60/.5=120>>120 The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: At the duck park, there are 25 mallard ducks and ten less than twice as many geese as ducks.  Then, a small flock of 4 ducks arrived at the park and joined the birds already there.  If five less than 15 geese leave the park, how many more geese than ducks remain at the park?\nA: Let's think step by step. Initially, twice as many geese as ducks is 25*2=<<25*2=50>>50 geese. Therefore, ten less than twice as many geese as ducks is 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 geese. Then, 4 ducks arrived at the park, resulting in 25+4=<<4+25=29>>29 ducks. Five less than 15 geese is 15-5=<<15-5=10>>10 geese. Thus, if 5 less than 15 geese leave, then 40-10=30 geese remain. Thus, there are 30-29=<<30-29=1>>1 more geese than ducks remaining at the park. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Mark is running for an election and wins 70% of the votes in an area with 100,000 voters.  He got twice as many total votes in the remaining area.  How many votes did he get in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. He got 100,000*.7=<<100000*.7=70000>>70,000 votes from the first area He got 70,000*2=<<70000*2=140000>>140,000 votes in the remaining areas So in total he got 140,000+70,000=<<140000+70000=210000>>210,000 votes The answer is 210000.\n\n\nQ: Phoebe has two pizzas to share with her and three friends. One has pepperoni and the other has cheese. They both have 16 slices. They all eat the same amount. One friend eats only pepperoni, while the rest have an equal number of slices of each. At the end, there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese, how many slices does each person eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. They are 9 slices of cheese because 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 They ate three slices of cheese each because 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3 They are 6 slices each in total because 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Michael has two brothers. His oldest brother is 1 year older than twice Michael's age when Michael was a year younger. His younger brother is 5 years old, which is a third of the age of the older brother. What is their combined age?\nA: Let's think step by step. The oldest brother is 15 because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 Michael is 8 because if 1 + (Michael's age - 1) x 2 = 15 then Michael's age = 8 Their combined age is 28 because 5 + 15 + 8 = <<5+15+8=28>>28 The answer is 28.\n\n\nQ: Carlos and Diego are racing around the block. Carlos runs around the entire block in 3 minutes. Diego runs around half the block in 2.5 minutes and then is tripped by a dog and can't finish. Assuming he kept up the same speed the entire race, what would've been the average time in seconds for the racers?\nA: Let's think step by step. If he finished the race, it would've taken 5 minutes because 2.5 x 2 = <<2.5*2=5>>5 Their total time would've been 8 minutes because 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 The average would've been 4 minutes because 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 The average time in seconds would've been 240 because 4 x 60 = <<4*60=240>>240 The answer is 240.\n\n\n"
