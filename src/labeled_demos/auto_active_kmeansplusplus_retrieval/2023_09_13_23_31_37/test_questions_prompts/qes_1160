  "test_question": "Q: The combined age of Peter, Paul and Jean is 100 years old. Find the age of Peter knowing that Paul is 10 years older than John and that Peter\u2019s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Michael has two brothers. His oldest brother is 1 year older than twice Michael's age when Michael was a year younger. His younger brother is 5 years old, which is a third of the age of the older brother. What is their combined age?\nA: Let's think step by step. The oldest brother is 15 because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 Michael is 8 because if 1 + (Michael's age - 1) x 2 = 15 then Michael's age = 8 Their combined age is 28 because 5 + 15 + 8 = <<5+15+8=28>>28 The answer is 28.\n\n\nQ: Tricia is a third of Amilia\u2019s age and Amilia is a quarter of Yorick\u2019s age. Yorick is twice Eugene\u2019s age and Khloe is a third of Eugene\u2019s age. Rupert is 10 years older than Khloe but 2 years younger than Vincent who is 22 years old. How old, in years, is Tricia?\nA: Let's think step by step. Rupert is younger than Vincent by 2 years, so he is 22 years old \u2013 2 years = <<22-2=20>>20 years old. Khloe is 10 years younger than Rupert so she is 20 years old \u2013 10 years = 10 years old. Eugene is 3 times older than Khloe so he is 10 years old * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 years old. Yorick is twice Eugene\u2019s age so he is 30 years old * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 years old. Amilia is a quarter of Yorick\u2019s age so she is 60 years old / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 years old. Tricia is a third of Amilia\u2019s age so she is 15 years old / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 years old. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Phoebe has two pizzas to share with her and three friends. One has pepperoni and the other has cheese. They both have 16 slices. They all eat the same amount. One friend eats only pepperoni, while the rest have an equal number of slices of each. At the end, there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese, how many slices does each person eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. They are 9 slices of cheese because 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 They ate three slices of cheese each because 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3 They are 6 slices each in total because 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First subtract the 7 double-counted animals from Mary's total: 60 animals - 7 animals = <<60-7=53>>53 animals Then add the animals she missed to find the real total: 53 animals + 3 pigs = <<53+3=56>>56 animals The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: The ratio of the amount of money Cara, Janet, and Jerry have is 4:5:6. If the total amount of money they have is $75, calculate the loss Cara and Janet will make if they combine their money to buy oranges and sell them at 80% of the buying price.\nA: Let's think step by step. The sum of the ratios representing the amount of money the three has is 4+5+6=<<4+5+6=15>>15 If the total amount of money they have is $75, the amount of money Cara has represented by the fraction 4/15 is 4/15*$75=$<<4/15*75=20>>20 Similarly, the amount of money Janet has represented by the fraction 5/15 of the total ratio is 5/15*$75=$<<5/15*75=25>>25 Combined, Cara and Janet have $20+25=$<<20+25=45>>45 If Cara and Janet buy goods worth $45 and sells them at 80% of the buying price, the selling price of the goods will be 80/100*$45=$<<45*80/100=36>>36 Since they bought the goods at $45 and sold them at $36, Janet and Cara would run at a loss of $45-$36=$<<45-36=9>>9 The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Brad\u2019s zip code consists of five numbers that add up to 10. The first and second numbers are the same. The third number is zero. The fourth number is double the first number. The fourth and fifth numbers add up to 8. What is Brad\u2019s zip code?\nA: Let's think step by step. The five numbers add up to 10, so the first three numbers add up to 10 - 8 = <<10-8=2>>2. The third number is 0, so the first two numbers add up to 2 - 0 = <<2-0=2>>2. The first and second numbers are equal, so they are both 2 / 2 = <<2/2=1>>1. The fourth number is double the first number, so it is 2 * 1 = <<1*2=2>>2. The fifth number is 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6. Thus, Brad\u2019s zip code is 11026. The answer is 11026.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. 20% of her 40 students will bring their own life vest so .20*40 = <<.20*40=8>>8 students will bring their life vests Alice has 20 life vests and 8 students will bring there's so that's 20+8 = <<20+8=28>>28 life vests There are 40 students and 10 instructors total so that's 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 people in the class If there are 28 life vests and she has 50 people then she needs to find 50-28 = 22 more life vests The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Aimee does a poll around her neighborhood and makes sure to get answers from 50% men and 50% women. She finds that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. How many people did she poll?\nA: Let's think step by step. 65% of women are opposed to the idea because 100 - 35 = <<100-35=65>>65 There are 60 women in the poll because 39 / .65 = <<39/.65=60>>60 There were 120 people in her poll because 60 / .5 = <<60/.5=120>>120 The answer is 120.\n\n\n"
