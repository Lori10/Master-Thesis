  "test_question": "Q: Sue lives in a fun neighborhood.  One weekend, the neighbors decided to play a prank on Sue.  On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard.  On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, painted them white, and put these newly painted white flamingos back out on Sue's front yard.  Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. At noon on Sunday, how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First subtract the 7 double-counted animals from Mary's total: 60 animals - 7 animals = <<60-7=53>>53 animals Then add the animals she missed to find the real total: 53 animals + 3 pigs = <<53+3=56>>56 animals The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: At the duck park, there are 25 mallard ducks and ten less than twice as many geese as ducks.  Then, a small flock of 4 ducks arrived at the park and joined the birds already there.  If five less than 15 geese leave the park, how many more geese than ducks remain at the park?\nA: Let's think step by step. Initially, twice as many geese as ducks is 25*2=<<25*2=50>>50 geese. Therefore, ten less than twice as many geese as ducks is 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 geese. Then, 4 ducks arrived at the park, resulting in 25+4=<<4+25=29>>29 ducks. Five less than 15 geese is 15-5=<<15-5=10>>10 geese. Thus, if 5 less than 15 geese leave, then 40-10=30 geese remain. Thus, there are 30-29=<<30-29=1>>1 more geese than ducks remaining at the park. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Seven parrots and some crows are perched on a tree branch. There was a noise and the same number of parrots and crows flew away. If only 2 parrots and 1 crow are left on the tree branch now, how many birds were perched on the branch to begin with?\nA: Let's think step by step. The number of parrots that flew away after the noise is 7-2 = <<7-2=5>>5 The same number of crows (5) flew away leaving 1 crow so there were 5+1 = <<5+1=6>>6 crows to begin with The total number of crows and parrots was 7+6 = <<7+6=13>>13 The answer is 13.\n\n\nQ: Timmy, Tommy and Tina are filling up a kiddie pool in their backyard.  Each has a pail they fill with water from a house before dumping it into the pool.  If Timmy's pail holds twice as much water as Tommy's, and Tommy's holds 2 gallons more than Tina's, and Tina's is 4 gallons, how much water do the three of them fill the pool with after 3 trips each?\nA: Let's think step by step. If Tina's pail holds 4 gallons and Tommy's holds 2 more gallons than hers, that means Tommy's holds 4+2=<<4+2=6>>6 gallons. If Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's 6-gallon pail, that means it holds 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 gallons. Therefore, in 1 trip that means all three move a total of 4+6+12=<<4+6+12=22>>22 gallons. In three trips, that means they would move a total of 22*3=<<22*3=66>>66 gallons The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. 20% of her 40 students will bring their own life vest so .20*40 = <<.20*40=8>>8 students will bring their life vests Alice has 20 life vests and 8 students will bring there's so that's 20+8 = <<20+8=28>>28 life vests There are 40 students and 10 instructors total so that's 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 people in the class If there are 28 life vests and she has 50 people then she needs to find 50-28 = 22 more life vests The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Aimee does a poll around her neighborhood and makes sure to get answers from 50% men and 50% women. She finds that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. How many people did she poll?\nA: Let's think step by step. 65% of women are opposed to the idea because 100 - 35 = <<100-35=65>>65 There are 60 women in the poll because 39 / .65 = <<39/.65=60>>60 There were 120 people in her poll because 60 / .5 = <<60/.5=120>>120 The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Bertha wears out 20 / 10 = <<20/10=2>>2 tennis balls in 20 games. She loses 20 / 5 = <<20/5=4>>4 tennis balls in 20 games. She buys canisters of 3 * 20 / 4 = <<3*20/4=15>>15 tennis balls in 20 games. Bertha started with 2 balls and gave 1 away, so she has 2 + 15 - 2 - 4 - 1 = <<2+15-2-4-1=10>>10 tennis balls after twenty games. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Madeline has 5 boxes with 24 crayons in each. She noticed that 5/8 of the crayons in the 2 boxes were not yet used. In the 2 other boxes, only 2/3 of the crayons were used while the last box was not entirely used. How many unused crayons did Madeline have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Two boxes of crayons have 24 x 5/8 = <<24*5/8=15>>15 unused crayons from each box. So, a total of 15 x 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 unused crayons are in the two boxes. For the other 2 boxes, there are 24 x 2/3 = <<24*2/3=16>>16 used crayons from each box. Hence, there are 24 - 16 = <<24-16=8>>8 unused crayons. So, a total of 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 unused crayons are in the other two boxes. Therefore, Madeline has a total of 30 + 16 + 24 = <<30+16+24=70>>70 unused crayons. The answer is 70.\n\n\n"
