  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Jill makes scented candles as a hobby. Her favorite scents are lavender, coconut, and almond, and she uses the same amount of each scent for every candle. This time, she made twice as many lavender candles as coconut candles, along with a batch of almond candles. She ran out of almond scent after making ten candles. If she had one and a half times as much coconut scent as almond scent and used all her coconut scent up too, how many lavender candles did she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. Jill made one and a half times as many coconut candles as almond candles, so she made 10 * 1 1/2 = 15 coconut candles. She made twice as many lavender candles as coconut candles, so she made 2 * 15 = <<2*15=30>>30 lavender candles. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: An elementary school teacher is making Halloween goodie bags for her class.  She wants the bags to be personalized, so she surveys her students asking whether they'd like a vampire-themed bag or a pumpkin-themed bag.  Of her 25 students, 11 indicate they want the vampire-themed bag and 14 indicate they want the pumpkin-themed bag.  The store the teacher shops at sells packs of 5 of each theme at a price of $3 per package, as well as individual bags of each theme at a price of $1 each.  What is the least amount of money the teacher can spend on the bags if she buys every student the theme they requested?\nA: Let's think step by step. Because it is cheaper to buy the packs of 5, the teacher should satisfy the 11 students who want the vampire theme with 2 packs of 5 and 1 individual bag. This will cost the teacher 2*3 + 1*1 = $<<2*3+1*1=7>>7. Similarly, the 14 students who want a pumpkin-themed bag can be satisfied by 2 packs of 5 and 4 individual bags at a cost of 2*3 + 4*1 = $<<2*3+4*1=10>>10. Therefore, the teacher must spend 7 + 10 = $<<7+10=17>>17. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: The ratio of the amount of money Cara, Janet, and Jerry have is 4:5:6. If the total amount of money they have is $75, calculate the loss Cara and Janet will make if they combine their money to buy oranges and sell them at 80% of the buying price.\nA: Let's think step by step. The sum of the ratios representing the amount of money the three has is 4+5+6=<<4+5+6=15>>15 If the total amount of money they have is $75, the amount of money Cara has represented by the fraction 4/15 is 4/15*$75=$<<4/15*75=20>>20 Similarly, the amount of money Janet has represented by the fraction 5/15 of the total ratio is 5/15*$75=$<<5/15*75=25>>25 Combined, Cara and Janet have $20+25=$<<20+25=45>>45 If Cara and Janet buy goods worth $45 and sells them at 80% of the buying price, the selling price of the goods will be 80/100*$45=$<<45*80/100=36>>36 Since they bought the goods at $45 and sold them at $36, Janet and Cara would run at a loss of $45-$36=$<<45-36=9>>9 The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Selina is selling some of her old clothes to a second-hand store. They will buy her pants for $5 each, her shorts for $3 each, and her shirts for $4 each. She sells 3 pairs of pants, 5 pairs of shorts, and some shirts. After she gets her money, she sees 2 shirts that she likes which cost $10 each and buys them. She leaves the store with $30. How many shirts did she sell to the store?\nA: Let's think step by step. The shirts she bought cost her $20 because 2 x 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 She earned $50 selling her clothes because 20 + 30 = <<20+30=50>>50 She made $15 off pants because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 She made 15 dollars from shorts because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 She made $20 off shirts because 50 - 15 - 15 = <<50-15-15=20>>20 She sold 5 shirts because 20 / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Hazel put up a lemonade stand. She sold half her lemonade to a construction crew. She sold 18 cups to kids on bikes. She gave away half that amount to her friends. Then she drank the last cup of lemonade herself. How many cups of lemonade did Hazel make?\nA: Let's think step by step. Hazel sold 18 cups of lemonade to kids on bikes and gave half that amount, or 18 / 2 = <<18/2=9>>9 cups, away to friends. Hazel sold 18 cups + gave away 9 cups + drank 1 cup = <<18+9+1=28>>28 cups. Since Hazel sold half her lemonade to a construction crew, that means the 28 cups she sold to kids on bikes, gave away to friends and drank herself are the other half, so she sold 28 cups to the construction crew. In all, Hazel sold 28 + 28 = <<28+28=56>>56 cups of lemonade. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Aimee does a poll around her neighborhood and makes sure to get answers from 50% men and 50% women. She finds that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. How many people did she poll?\nA: Let's think step by step. 65% of women are opposed to the idea because 100 - 35 = <<100-35=65>>65 There are 60 women in the poll because 39 / .65 = <<39/.65=60>>60 There were 120 people in her poll because 60 / .5 = <<60/.5=120>>120 The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: Ryan works in an office that has an even number of men and women working there.  Ryan participates in a meeting composed of 4 men and 6 women who are pulled from the office floor.   This reduces the number of women working on the office floor by 20%.  How many people work at Ryan's office?\nA: Let's think step by step. Since 6 women are 20% of the total number of women working there, that means there are 6*5= <<6*5=30>>30 women working there in total. Since there are an even number of women and men working in the office, that means there are 30*2= <<30*2=60>>60 people working there in total, since there are 2 sexes. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: An apple tree has three times as many apples as the number of plums on a plum tree. If Damien picks 3/5 of the fruits from the trees, calculate the total number of plums and apples remaining on the tree if there were 180 apples on the apple tree before Damien picked any of the fruits.\nA: Let's think step by step. Initially, the were 180//3= <<180//3=60>>60 plums on the plum tree. When Damien picked 3/5 of the apples from the apple tree, he picked 3/5*180 = <<3/5*180=108>>108 apples The number of apples remaining on the apple tree is 180-108= <<180-108=72>>72 The number of plums that Damien picked from the plum tree is 3/5*60 = <<3/5*60=36>>36 The number of plums remaining on the plum tree is 60-36 = <<60-36=24>>24 The total number of fruits remaining on the trees is 72 apples+24 plums = <<72+24=96>>96 The answer is 96.\n\n\n"
