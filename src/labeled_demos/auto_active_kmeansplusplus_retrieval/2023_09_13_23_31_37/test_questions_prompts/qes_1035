  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Ryan works in an office that has an even number of men and women working there.  Ryan participates in a meeting composed of 4 men and 6 women who are pulled from the office floor.   This reduces the number of women working on the office floor by 20%.  How many people work at Ryan's office?\nA: Let's think step by step. Since 6 women are 20% of the total number of women working there, that means there are 6*5= <<6*5=30>>30 women working there in total. Since there are an even number of women and men working in the office, that means there are 30*2= <<30*2=60>>60 people working there in total, since there are 2 sexes. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Mark is running for an election and wins 70% of the votes in an area with 100,000 voters.  He got twice as many total votes in the remaining area.  How many votes did he get in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. He got 100,000*.7=<<100000*.7=70000>>70,000 votes from the first area He got 70,000*2=<<70000*2=140000>>140,000 votes in the remaining areas So in total he got 140,000+70,000=<<140000+70000=210000>>210,000 votes The answer is 210000.\n\n\nQ: Aimee does a poll around her neighborhood and makes sure to get answers from 50% men and 50% women. She finds that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. How many people did she poll?\nA: Let's think step by step. 65% of women are opposed to the idea because 100 - 35 = <<100-35=65>>65 There are 60 women in the poll because 39 / .65 = <<39/.65=60>>60 There were 120 people in her poll because 60 / .5 = <<60/.5=120>>120 The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: A soccer team had 24 players prepared for a soccer game. The first half saw 11 players start the game with 2 substitutions made. In the second half, the team made twice as many substitutions as it made in the first half. How many players on the team did not play that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. With two substitutions, 11+2 = <<11+2=13>>13 players from the team played the game in the first half. In the second half, the team made twice the number of substitutions it made in the first half, a total of 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 substitutions. The total number of players who played the game is 13+4 = <<13+4=17>>17 If the soccer team had 24 players prepared for the soccer game, the number of players who did not play the game is 24-17 = <<24-17=7>>7 players. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Seven parrots and some crows are perched on a tree branch. There was a noise and the same number of parrots and crows flew away. If only 2 parrots and 1 crow are left on the tree branch now, how many birds were perched on the branch to begin with?\nA: Let's think step by step. The number of parrots that flew away after the noise is 7-2 = <<7-2=5>>5 The same number of crows (5) flew away leaving 1 crow so there were 5+1 = <<5+1=6>>6 crows to begin with The total number of crows and parrots was 7+6 = <<7+6=13>>13 The answer is 13.\n\n\nQ: Logan makes $65,000 a year. He spends $20,000 on rent every year, $5000 on groceries every year, and $8000 on gas every year. If he wants to have at least $42000 left, how much more money must he make each year?\nA: Let's think step by step. Logan spends 20000+5000+8000 = <<20000+5000+8000=33000>>33000 a year. Logan has 65000-33000 = <<65000-33000=32000>>32000 left a year. Logan needs to make 42000-32000 = <<42000-32000=10000>>10000 more a year. The answer is 10000.\n\n\nQ: Brad\u2019s zip code consists of five numbers that add up to 10. The first and second numbers are the same. The third number is zero. The fourth number is double the first number. The fourth and fifth numbers add up to 8. What is Brad\u2019s zip code?\nA: Let's think step by step. The five numbers add up to 10, so the first three numbers add up to 10 - 8 = <<10-8=2>>2. The third number is 0, so the first two numbers add up to 2 - 0 = <<2-0=2>>2. The first and second numbers are equal, so they are both 2 / 2 = <<2/2=1>>1. The fourth number is double the first number, so it is 2 * 1 = <<1*2=2>>2. The fifth number is 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6. Thus, Brad\u2019s zip code is 11026. The answer is 11026.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First subtract the 7 double-counted animals from Mary's total: 60 animals - 7 animals = <<60-7=53>>53 animals Then add the animals she missed to find the real total: 53 animals + 3 pigs = <<53+3=56>>56 animals The answer is 56.\n\n\n"
