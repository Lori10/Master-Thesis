  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Bertha wears out 20 / 10 = <<20/10=2>>2 tennis balls in 20 games. She loses 20 / 5 = <<20/5=4>>4 tennis balls in 20 games. She buys canisters of 3 * 20 / 4 = <<3*20/4=15>>15 tennis balls in 20 games. Bertha started with 2 balls and gave 1 away, so she has 2 + 15 - 2 - 4 - 1 = <<2+15-2-4-1=10>>10 tennis balls after twenty games. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First subtract the 7 double-counted animals from Mary's total: 60 animals - 7 animals = <<60-7=53>>53 animals Then add the animals she missed to find the real total: 53 animals + 3 pigs = <<53+3=56>>56 animals The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Madeline has 5 boxes with 24 crayons in each. She noticed that 5/8 of the crayons in the 2 boxes were not yet used. In the 2 other boxes, only 2/3 of the crayons were used while the last box was not entirely used. How many unused crayons did Madeline have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Two boxes of crayons have 24 x 5/8 = <<24*5/8=15>>15 unused crayons from each box. So, a total of 15 x 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 unused crayons are in the two boxes. For the other 2 boxes, there are 24 x 2/3 = <<24*2/3=16>>16 used crayons from each box. Hence, there are 24 - 16 = <<24-16=8>>8 unused crayons. So, a total of 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 unused crayons are in the other two boxes. Therefore, Madeline has a total of 30 + 16 + 24 = <<30+16+24=70>>70 unused crayons. The answer is 70.\n\n\nQ: Hazel put up a lemonade stand. She sold half her lemonade to a construction crew. She sold 18 cups to kids on bikes. She gave away half that amount to her friends. Then she drank the last cup of lemonade herself. How many cups of lemonade did Hazel make?\nA: Let's think step by step. Hazel sold 18 cups of lemonade to kids on bikes and gave half that amount, or 18 / 2 = <<18/2=9>>9 cups, away to friends. Hazel sold 18 cups + gave away 9 cups + drank 1 cup = <<18+9+1=28>>28 cups. Since Hazel sold half her lemonade to a construction crew, that means the 28 cups she sold to kids on bikes, gave away to friends and drank herself are the other half, so she sold 28 cups to the construction crew. In all, Hazel sold 28 + 28 = <<28+28=56>>56 cups of lemonade. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: At the duck park, there are 25 mallard ducks and ten less than twice as many geese as ducks.  Then, a small flock of 4 ducks arrived at the park and joined the birds already there.  If five less than 15 geese leave the park, how many more geese than ducks remain at the park?\nA: Let's think step by step. Initially, twice as many geese as ducks is 25*2=<<25*2=50>>50 geese. Therefore, ten less than twice as many geese as ducks is 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 geese. Then, 4 ducks arrived at the park, resulting in 25+4=<<4+25=29>>29 ducks. Five less than 15 geese is 15-5=<<15-5=10>>10 geese. Thus, if 5 less than 15 geese leave, then 40-10=30 geese remain. Thus, there are 30-29=<<30-29=1>>1 more geese than ducks remaining at the park. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Phoebe has two pizzas to share with her and three friends. One has pepperoni and the other has cheese. They both have 16 slices. They all eat the same amount. One friend eats only pepperoni, while the rest have an equal number of slices of each. At the end, there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese, how many slices does each person eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. They are 9 slices of cheese because 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 They ate three slices of cheese each because 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3 They are 6 slices each in total because 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Timmy, Tommy and Tina are filling up a kiddie pool in their backyard.  Each has a pail they fill with water from a house before dumping it into the pool.  If Timmy's pail holds twice as much water as Tommy's, and Tommy's holds 2 gallons more than Tina's, and Tina's is 4 gallons, how much water do the three of them fill the pool with after 3 trips each?\nA: Let's think step by step. If Tina's pail holds 4 gallons and Tommy's holds 2 more gallons than hers, that means Tommy's holds 4+2=<<4+2=6>>6 gallons. If Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's 6-gallon pail, that means it holds 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 gallons. Therefore, in 1 trip that means all three move a total of 4+6+12=<<4+6+12=22>>22 gallons. In three trips, that means they would move a total of 22*3=<<22*3=66>>66 gallons The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: Bea's mom planted 50 Mahogany and 30 Narra trees on their farm. Due to a typhoon, a total of 5 trees fell. One more Mahogany tree fell than the number of Narra trees that fell. A month after the typhoon, Bea's mom planted twice as much as the number of the Narra and thrice the number of Mahogany trees that fell. How many trees are now on the farm?\nA: Let's think step by step. Before the typhoon, their farm had a total of 50 trees + 30 trees = <<50+30=80>>80 trees. If there was 1 more than Mahogany than Narra tree that fell, then this means there were 2 Narra trees and 2 + 1 = 3 Mahogany trees that fell during the typhoon. So, Bea's mom planted 2 trees x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 Narra trees. She also planted 3 trees x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 Mahogany trees. So, her mom planted 4 trees + 9 trees = <<4+9=13>>13 more trees. After the typhoon, they only had 80 trees - 5 trees = <<80-5=75>>75 trees left. Therefore, there are 75 trees + 13 trees = <<75+13=88>>88 trees now. The answer is 88.\n\n\n"
