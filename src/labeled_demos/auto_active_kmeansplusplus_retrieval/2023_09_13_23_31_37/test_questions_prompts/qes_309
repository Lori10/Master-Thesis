  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Michael has two brothers. His oldest brother is 1 year older than twice Michael's age when Michael was a year younger. His younger brother is 5 years old, which is a third of the age of the older brother. What is their combined age?\nA: Let's think step by step. The oldest brother is 15 because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 Michael is 8 because if 1 + (Michael's age - 1) x 2 = 15 then Michael's age = 8 Their combined age is 28 because 5 + 15 + 8 = <<5+15+8=28>>28 The answer is 28.\n\n\nQ: Tricia is a third of Amilia\u2019s age and Amilia is a quarter of Yorick\u2019s age. Yorick is twice Eugene\u2019s age and Khloe is a third of Eugene\u2019s age. Rupert is 10 years older than Khloe but 2 years younger than Vincent who is 22 years old. How old, in years, is Tricia?\nA: Let's think step by step. Rupert is younger than Vincent by 2 years, so he is 22 years old \u2013 2 years = <<22-2=20>>20 years old. Khloe is 10 years younger than Rupert so she is 20 years old \u2013 10 years = 10 years old. Eugene is 3 times older than Khloe so he is 10 years old * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 years old. Yorick is twice Eugene\u2019s age so he is 30 years old * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 years old. Amilia is a quarter of Yorick\u2019s age so she is 60 years old / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 years old. Tricia is a third of Amilia\u2019s age so she is 15 years old / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 years old. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Timmy, Tommy and Tina are filling up a kiddie pool in their backyard.  Each has a pail they fill with water from a house before dumping it into the pool.  If Timmy's pail holds twice as much water as Tommy's, and Tommy's holds 2 gallons more than Tina's, and Tina's is 4 gallons, how much water do the three of them fill the pool with after 3 trips each?\nA: Let's think step by step. If Tina's pail holds 4 gallons and Tommy's holds 2 more gallons than hers, that means Tommy's holds 4+2=<<4+2=6>>6 gallons. If Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's 6-gallon pail, that means it holds 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 gallons. Therefore, in 1 trip that means all three move a total of 4+6+12=<<4+6+12=22>>22 gallons. In three trips, that means they would move a total of 22*3=<<22*3=66>>66 gallons The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: Logan makes $65,000 a year. He spends $20,000 on rent every year, $5000 on groceries every year, and $8000 on gas every year. If he wants to have at least $42000 left, how much more money must he make each year?\nA: Let's think step by step. Logan spends 20000+5000+8000 = <<20000+5000+8000=33000>>33000 a year. Logan has 65000-33000 = <<65000-33000=32000>>32000 left a year. Logan needs to make 42000-32000 = <<42000-32000=10000>>10000 more a year. The answer is 10000.\n\n\nQ: James wants to build a ladder to climb a very tall tree.  Each rung of the ladder is 18 inches long and they are 6 inches apart.  If he needs to climb 50 feet how many feet of wood will he need for the rungs?\nA: Let's think step by step. He needs 12/6=<<12/6=2>>2 rungs per foot So he needs 50*2=<<50*2=100>>100 rungs Each rung is 18/12=<<18/12=1.5>>1.5 feet So he needs 1.5*100=<<1.5*100=150>>150 feet The answer is 150.\n\n\nQ: Patricia is growing her long very long to donate it to a charity that makes wigs for cancer survivors. Her hair is 14 inches long. She needs to donate 23 inches to make a wig. She wants her hair to be 12 inches long after the donation. How much longer does she have to grow her hair?\nA: Let's think step by step. Her hair needs to be 35 inches long when she cuts it because 23 + 12 = <<23+12=35>>35 She needs to grow it 21 more inches because 35 - 14 = <<35-14=21>>21 The answer is 21.\n\n\nQ: Hazel put up a lemonade stand. She sold half her lemonade to a construction crew. She sold 18 cups to kids on bikes. She gave away half that amount to her friends. Then she drank the last cup of lemonade herself. How many cups of lemonade did Hazel make?\nA: Let's think step by step. Hazel sold 18 cups of lemonade to kids on bikes and gave half that amount, or 18 / 2 = <<18/2=9>>9 cups, away to friends. Hazel sold 18 cups + gave away 9 cups + drank 1 cup = <<18+9+1=28>>28 cups. Since Hazel sold half her lemonade to a construction crew, that means the 28 cups she sold to kids on bikes, gave away to friends and drank herself are the other half, so she sold 28 cups to the construction crew. In all, Hazel sold 28 + 28 = <<28+28=56>>56 cups of lemonade. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Gwen received a $900 bonus at work and decided to invest this money in the stock market.  She spent one-third of her bonus on stock A, one-third on stock B, and the remaining one-third on stock C.   After one year, stock A and stock B had doubled in value, while stock C had lost half of its value.  At the end of the year, how much were Gwen's stocks worth, in dollars?\nA: Let's think step by step. One-third of her bonus was $900/3 = $<<900/3=300>>300. After one year, stock A doubled in value and was worth $300*2 = $<<300*2=600>>600. After one year, stock B doubled in value and was worth $300*2 = $<<300*2=600>>600. After one year, stock C had lost half its value and was worth $300/2 = $<<300/2=150>>150. Altogether, at the end of the year, Gwen's stocks were worth $600+$600+$150 = $<<600+600+150=1350>>1350 The answer is 1350.\n\n\n"
