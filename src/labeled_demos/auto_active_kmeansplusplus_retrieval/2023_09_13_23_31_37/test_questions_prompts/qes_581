Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser packed in bags. Two hours after the trucks had departed for delivery, Mr Hezekiah got the news that a quarter of the number of lorries dispatched for delivery had mechanical failures on the road and could not deliver the fertilisers to the farmers. Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: On the first day of the journey, the Skipper sailed his ship halfway to the destination by traveling due east for 20 hours at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour, and then turned the ship's engines off to let them cool down. But while the engines were off, a wind storm blew his vessel backward in a westward direction.  After the storm, the Skipper used his GPS device to determine the new location of the ship, and he discovered that he was only one-third of the way to his destination.  How many kilometers had the ship been blown in a westward direction by the storm?\nA: Let's think step by step. Traveling 20 hours due east at 30 kilometers per hour, the ship sailed 20*30=<<20*30=600>>600 kilometers the first day. If half the distance to the destination is 600 kilometers, then 2*600=<<2*600=1200>>1200 kilometers is the total distance from start to destination. One-third of the distance from start to destination is 1/3 * 1200 = <<1200/3=400>>400 kilometers. Thus, the wind storm blew the ship in a westward direction for 600 - 400 = <<600-400=200>>200 kilometers. The answer is 200.\n\n\nQ: Hazel put up a lemonade stand. She sold half her lemonade to a construction crew. She sold 18 cups to kids on bikes. She gave away half that amount to her friends. Then she drank the last cup of lemonade herself. How many cups of lemonade did Hazel make?\nA: Let's think step by step. Hazel sold 18 cups of lemonade to kids on bikes and gave half that amount, or 18 / 2 = <<18/2=9>>9 cups, away to friends. Hazel sold 18 cups + gave away 9 cups + drank 1 cup = <<18+9+1=28>>28 cups. Since Hazel sold half her lemonade to a construction crew, that means the 28 cups she sold to kids on bikes, gave away to friends and drank herself are the other half, so she sold 28 cups to the construction crew. In all, Hazel sold 28 + 28 = <<28+28=56>>56 cups of lemonade. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Bea's mom planted 50 Mahogany and 30 Narra trees on their farm. Due to a typhoon, a total of 5 trees fell. One more Mahogany tree fell than the number of Narra trees that fell. A month after the typhoon, Bea's mom planted twice as much as the number of the Narra and thrice the number of Mahogany trees that fell. How many trees are now on the farm?\nA: Let's think step by step. Before the typhoon, their farm had a total of 50 trees + 30 trees = <<50+30=80>>80 trees. If there was 1 more than Mahogany than Narra tree that fell, then this means there were 2 Narra trees and 2 + 1 = 3 Mahogany trees that fell during the typhoon. So, Bea's mom planted 2 trees x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 Narra trees. She also planted 3 trees x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 Mahogany trees. So, her mom planted 4 trees + 9 trees = <<4+9=13>>13 more trees. After the typhoon, they only had 80 trees - 5 trees = <<80-5=75>>75 trees left. Therefore, there are 75 trees + 13 trees = <<75+13=88>>88 trees now. The answer is 88.\n\n\nQ: Mr. McNeely takes a register of the total number of students present in class every day. On a particular week, the number of students in the class on the second day was 40 more than the first day. The number of students who didn't turn up for the class on the second day was twice the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day. On the third day, 1/7 of the total number of students of the class called in sick. If the total number of students in the class is 280, calculate the number of absent students in the three days.\nA: Let's think step by step. On the third day, 1/7*280 = <<1/7*280=40>>40 students called in sick. If the number of students absent on the second day was twice the number on the third day, then 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80 students didn't show up for the class on the second day. The total number of students present in the class on the second day was 280-80= <<280-80=200>>200. If 40 fewer students showed up for the class on the first day than on the second day, then 200-40 = <<200-40=160>>160 students showed up for the class on the first day. The number of students absent on the first day is 280-160 = <<280-160=120>>120 In the three days, the total number of absentees is 120+80+40 = <<120+80+40=240>>240 The answer is 240.\n\n\nQ: Timmy, Tommy and Tina are filling up a kiddie pool in their backyard.  Each has a pail they fill with water from a house before dumping it into the pool.  If Timmy's pail holds twice as much water as Tommy's, and Tommy's holds 2 gallons more than Tina's, and Tina's is 4 gallons, how much water do the three of them fill the pool with after 3 trips each?\nA: Let's think step by step. If Tina's pail holds 4 gallons and Tommy's holds 2 more gallons than hers, that means Tommy's holds 4+2=<<4+2=6>>6 gallons. If Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's 6-gallon pail, that means it holds 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 gallons. Therefore, in 1 trip that means all three move a total of 4+6+12=<<4+6+12=22>>22 gallons. In three trips, that means they would move a total of 22*3=<<22*3=66>>66 gallons The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: Emery's family decides to travel for a weekend trip. They drive the first 100 miles in 1 hour. They stop at a McDonald's and then continue the rest of the journey for 300 miles. What's the total number of hours they traveled?\nA: Let's think step by step. If the first 100 miles took one hour, then let's say the next 300 miles took x hours. if 100 miles = 1 hour, then 300 miles =x. To find the number of hours traveled for the 300 miles, x = 300*1/100 x= <<3=3>>3 hours. The total number of hours will be 3 +1 = <<3+1=4>>4 hours The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: An apple tree has three times as many apples as the number of plums on a plum tree. If Damien picks 3/5 of the fruits from the trees, calculate the total number of plums and apples remaining on the tree if there were 180 apples on the apple tree before Damien picked any of the fruits.\nA: Let's think step by step. Initially, the were 180//3= <<180//3=60>>60 plums on the plum tree. When Damien picked 3/5 of the apples from the apple tree, he picked 3/5*180 = <<3/5*180=108>>108 apples The number of apples remaining on the apple tree is 180-108= <<180-108=72>>72 The number of plums that Damien picked from the plum tree is 3/5*60 = <<3/5*60=36>>36 The number of plums remaining on the plum tree is 60-36 = <<60-36=24>>24 The total number of fruits remaining on the trees is 72 apples+24 plums = <<72+24=96>>96 The answer is 96.\n\n\nQ: A big snowstorm caused a large amount of snow to fall onto Grandpa's farm, and the wind caused the snow to pile up into a drift.  But on the second day, it warmed up enough that half of the snowdrift melted.  The third day, it snowed again, adding another 6 inches of snow onto the snowdrift.  On the fourth day, another 18 inches of snow fell onto the snowdrift.  If the snowdrift was 34 inches deep at the end of the fourth day, how deep in inches was the drift at the end of the first day?\nA: Let's think step by step. The third and fourth day contributed 6+18=<<6+18=24>>24 inches to the depth of the snowdrift. Therefore, the size of the snowdrift after half was melted on the second day, but before the snowfall on the third and fourth day, was 34-24=<<34-24=10>>10 inches. If the size of the drift on the second day, after half of the snow had melted, was 10 inches, then the depth of the original drift created on day 1 was 2*10=20 inches deep. The answer is 20.\n\n\n"
