  "test_question": "Q: Nate's dog can dig six holes a day. He digs for 14 days while Nate is on vacation. When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. How many weeks does it take him to fill in all the holes?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A big snowstorm caused a large amount of snow to fall onto Grandpa's farm, and the wind caused the snow to pile up into a drift.  But on the second day, it warmed up enough that half of the snowdrift melted.  The third day, it snowed again, adding another 6 inches of snow onto the snowdrift.  On the fourth day, another 18 inches of snow fell onto the snowdrift.  If the snowdrift was 34 inches deep at the end of the fourth day, how deep in inches was the drift at the end of the first day?\nA: Let's think step by step. The third and fourth day contributed 6+18=<<6+18=24>>24 inches to the depth of the snowdrift. Therefore, the size of the snowdrift after half was melted on the second day, but before the snowfall on the third and fourth day, was 34-24=<<34-24=10>>10 inches. If the size of the drift on the second day, after half of the snow had melted, was 10 inches, then the depth of the original drift created on day 1 was 2*10=20 inches deep. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Timmy, Tommy and Tina are filling up a kiddie pool in their backyard.  Each has a pail they fill with water from a house before dumping it into the pool.  If Timmy's pail holds twice as much water as Tommy's, and Tommy's holds 2 gallons more than Tina's, and Tina's is 4 gallons, how much water do the three of them fill the pool with after 3 trips each?\nA: Let's think step by step. If Tina's pail holds 4 gallons and Tommy's holds 2 more gallons than hers, that means Tommy's holds 4+2=<<4+2=6>>6 gallons. If Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's 6-gallon pail, that means it holds 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 gallons. Therefore, in 1 trip that means all three move a total of 4+6+12=<<4+6+12=22>>22 gallons. In three trips, that means they would move a total of 22*3=<<22*3=66>>66 gallons The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: Hank reads the newspaper every morning, 5 days a week for 30 minutes.  He reads part of a novel every evening, 5 days a week, for 1 hour.  He doubles his reading time on Saturday and Sundays.  How many minutes does Hank spend reading in 1 week?\nA: Let's think step by step. He reads 30 minutes in the morning 5 days a week for a total of 30*5 = <<30*5=150>>150 minutes He doubles his reading time on the weekends so 30*2 = <<30*2=60>>60 minutes per day He reads 60 minutes on Saturday and Sunday in the mornings for a total of 60+60 = <<60+60=120>>120 minutes He reads 1 hour in the evenings 5 days a week for a total of 1*5 = <<1*5=5>>5 hours He doubles his reading time on the weekends so 1*2 = <<1*2=2>>2 hours per day He reads 2 hours on Saturday and Sunday in the evenings for a total of 2+2 = <<2+2=4>>4 hours He read 5+4 = 9 hours which, when converted to minutes is 9*60 = 540 minutes He reads 150 minutes in the morning and 120 minutes in the evenings and 540 over the weekend for a total of 150+120+540 = 810 minutes in 1 week The answer is 810.\n\n\nQ: John adopts a dog from a shelter.  The dog ends up having health problems and this requires 3 vet appointments,  which cost $400 each.  After the first appointment, John paid $100 for pet insurance that covers 80% of the subsequent visits.  How much did he pay in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. He got a discount of 400*.8=$<<400*.8=320>>320 He got that discount for 3-1=<<3-1=2>>2 visits So each of those visits cost 400-320=$<<400-320=80>>80 So he paid 2*80=$<<2*80=160>>160 for those visits That means he paid a total of 400+160+100=$<<400+160+100=660>>660 The answer is 660.\n\n\nQ: Carlos and Diego are racing around the block. Carlos runs around the entire block in 3 minutes. Diego runs around half the block in 2.5 minutes and then is tripped by a dog and can't finish. Assuming he kept up the same speed the entire race, what would've been the average time in seconds for the racers?\nA: Let's think step by step. If he finished the race, it would've taken 5 minutes because 2.5 x 2 = <<2.5*2=5>>5 Their total time would've been 8 minutes because 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 The average would've been 4 minutes because 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 The average time in seconds would've been 240 because 4 x 60 = <<4*60=240>>240 The answer is 240.\n\n\nQ: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Bertha wears out 20 / 10 = <<20/10=2>>2 tennis balls in 20 games. She loses 20 / 5 = <<20/5=4>>4 tennis balls in 20 games. She buys canisters of 3 * 20 / 4 = <<3*20/4=15>>15 tennis balls in 20 games. Bertha started with 2 balls and gave 1 away, so she has 2 + 15 - 2 - 4 - 1 = <<2+15-2-4-1=10>>10 tennis balls after twenty games. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Enrique has 2 132 contracts that he needs to shred.  His paper shredder will only allow him to shred 6 pages at a time.  How many times will he shred 6 units of paper until all of the contracts are shredded?\nA: Let's think step by step. He has 2 contracts that are 132 pages each so that's 2*132 = <<2*132=264>>264 pages He can only shred 6 pages at a time so it will take him 264/6 = <<264/6=44>>44 units The answer is 44.\n\n\nQ: Tim drinks 2 bottles that are each 1.5 quarts and an additional 20 ounces a day.  How much water does he drink a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. The bottles are 1.5*32=<<1.5*32=48>>48 ounces So he drinks 48*2=<<48*2=96>>96 ounces from the bottles So in total he drank 96+20=<<96+20=116>>116 ounces a day 116*7=<<116*7=812>>812 ounces a week The answer is 812.\n\n\n"
