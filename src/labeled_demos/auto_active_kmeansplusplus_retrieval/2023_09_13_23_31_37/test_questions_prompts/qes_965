  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Madeline has 5 boxes with 24 crayons in each. She noticed that 5/8 of the crayons in the 2 boxes were not yet used. In the 2 other boxes, only 2/3 of the crayons were used while the last box was not entirely used. How many unused crayons did Madeline have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Two boxes of crayons have 24 x 5/8 = <<24*5/8=15>>15 unused crayons from each box. So, a total of 15 x 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 unused crayons are in the two boxes. For the other 2 boxes, there are 24 x 2/3 = <<24*2/3=16>>16 used crayons from each box. Hence, there are 24 - 16 = <<24-16=8>>8 unused crayons. So, a total of 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 unused crayons are in the other two boxes. Therefore, Madeline has a total of 30 + 16 + 24 = <<30+16+24=70>>70 unused crayons. The answer is 70.\n\n\nQ: Alexander draws 9 pictures for an exhibition at a gallery. 5 new galleries also want Alexander to draw for them, so he draws pictures for their exhibitions too. Each of these new galleries receives the same amount of pictures. For each picture, Alexander needs 4 pencils. For each exhibition, he needs another 2 pencils for signing his signature on the pictures. If Alexander uses 88 pencils on drawing and signing his pictures for all of the exhibitions, how many paintings are at each of the 5 new galleries?\nA: Let's think step by step. Alexander has sent pictures to a total of 1 original gallery + 5 new galleries = <<1+5=6>>6 galleries. For signatures, he has used a total of 6 galleries * 2 pencils per gallery = <<6*2=12>>12 pencils. So of the pencils that he used, 88 total pencils \u2013 12 signature pencils = <<88-12=76>>76 pencils for drawings. At the first gallery, he used 9 pictures * 4 pencils per picture = <<9*4=36>>36 pencils. So in the new galleries, he used 76 total pencils for drawings \u2013 36 pencils at the first gallery = <<76-36=40>>40 pencils. The new galleries received a total of 40 pencils / 4 pencils per picture = <<40/4=10>>10 pictures. As the new galleries all receive equal amounts of pictures, each gallery must have 10 pictures / 5 galleries = <<10/5=2>>2 pictures per gallery. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: At the duck park, there are 25 mallard ducks and ten less than twice as many geese as ducks.  Then, a small flock of 4 ducks arrived at the park and joined the birds already there.  If five less than 15 geese leave the park, how many more geese than ducks remain at the park?\nA: Let's think step by step. Initially, twice as many geese as ducks is 25*2=<<25*2=50>>50 geese. Therefore, ten less than twice as many geese as ducks is 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 geese. Then, 4 ducks arrived at the park, resulting in 25+4=<<4+25=29>>29 ducks. Five less than 15 geese is 15-5=<<15-5=10>>10 geese. Thus, if 5 less than 15 geese leave, then 40-10=30 geese remain. Thus, there are 30-29=<<30-29=1>>1 more geese than ducks remaining at the park. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First subtract the 7 double-counted animals from Mary's total: 60 animals - 7 animals = <<60-7=53>>53 animals Then add the animals she missed to find the real total: 53 animals + 3 pigs = <<53+3=56>>56 animals The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: A big snowstorm caused a large amount of snow to fall onto Grandpa's farm, and the wind caused the snow to pile up into a drift.  But on the second day, it warmed up enough that half of the snowdrift melted.  The third day, it snowed again, adding another 6 inches of snow onto the snowdrift.  On the fourth day, another 18 inches of snow fell onto the snowdrift.  If the snowdrift was 34 inches deep at the end of the fourth day, how deep in inches was the drift at the end of the first day?\nA: Let's think step by step. The third and fourth day contributed 6+18=<<6+18=24>>24 inches to the depth of the snowdrift. Therefore, the size of the snowdrift after half was melted on the second day, but before the snowfall on the third and fourth day, was 34-24=<<34-24=10>>10 inches. If the size of the drift on the second day, after half of the snow had melted, was 10 inches, then the depth of the original drift created on day 1 was 2*10=20 inches deep. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Alyssa took 100 photos on vacation. She wants to put them in a photo album with 30 pages. She can place 3 photos each on the first 10 pages. Then she can place 4 photos each on the next 10 pages. If she wants to put an equal number of photos on each of the remaining pages of the album, how many photos can she place on each page?\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 3 x 10 = <<3*10=30>>30 photos in total that can be placed in the first 10 pages. There are 4 x 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 photos in total that can be placed in the next 10 pages. A total of 10 + 10 = <<10+10=20>>20 pages of the album have been used. A total of 30 + 40 = <<30+40=70>>70 photos can be placed on those 20 pages. So there are still 100 - 70 = <<100-70=30>>30 photos left to be placed on the album. And there are 30 - 20 = <<30-20=10>>10 pages left in the album. Therefore, 30/10 = <<30/10=3>>3 photos can be placed on each of the pages. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: An elementary school teacher is making Halloween goodie bags for her class.  She wants the bags to be personalized, so she surveys her students asking whether they'd like a vampire-themed bag or a pumpkin-themed bag.  Of her 25 students, 11 indicate they want the vampire-themed bag and 14 indicate they want the pumpkin-themed bag.  The store the teacher shops at sells packs of 5 of each theme at a price of $3 per package, as well as individual bags of each theme at a price of $1 each.  What is the least amount of money the teacher can spend on the bags if she buys every student the theme they requested?\nA: Let's think step by step. Because it is cheaper to buy the packs of 5, the teacher should satisfy the 11 students who want the vampire theme with 2 packs of 5 and 1 individual bag. This will cost the teacher 2*3 + 1*1 = $<<2*3+1*1=7>>7. Similarly, the 14 students who want a pumpkin-themed bag can be satisfied by 2 packs of 5 and 4 individual bags at a cost of 2*3 + 4*1 = $<<2*3+4*1=10>>10. Therefore, the teacher must spend 7 + 10 = $<<7+10=17>>17. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Timmy, Tommy and Tina are filling up a kiddie pool in their backyard.  Each has a pail they fill with water from a house before dumping it into the pool.  If Timmy's pail holds twice as much water as Tommy's, and Tommy's holds 2 gallons more than Tina's, and Tina's is 4 gallons, how much water do the three of them fill the pool with after 3 trips each?\nA: Let's think step by step. If Tina's pail holds 4 gallons and Tommy's holds 2 more gallons than hers, that means Tommy's holds 4+2=<<4+2=6>>6 gallons. If Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's 6-gallon pail, that means it holds 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 gallons. Therefore, in 1 trip that means all three move a total of 4+6+12=<<4+6+12=22>>22 gallons. In three trips, that means they would move a total of 22*3=<<22*3=66>>66 gallons The answer is 66.\n\n\n"
