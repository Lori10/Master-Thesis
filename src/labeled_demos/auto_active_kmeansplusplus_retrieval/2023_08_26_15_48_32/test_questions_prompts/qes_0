  "formatted_prompt": "Q: 4 friends are running a 4 x 100 relay race.  Mary ran first and took twice as long as Susan.  Susan ran second and she took 10 seconds longer than Jen.  Jen ran third and finished in 30 seconds.  Tiffany ran the last leg and finished in 7 seconds less than Mary.  How many seconds did it take the team to finish the race?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nSusan's time was 30 seconds + 10 seconds = <<30+10=40>>40 seconds.\nMary's time was 40 seconds * 2 = <<40*2=80>>80 seconds.\nTiffany's time was 80 seconds - 7 seconds = <<80-7=73>>73 seconds.\nThe total time for the team was 80 seconds + 40 seconds + 30 seconds + 73 seconds = <<80+40+30+73=223>>223 seconds. The answer is 223.\n\n\nQ: Carolyn is planning out her final essay. The introduction will be 450 words, the conclusion will be triple the length of the introduction, and each of the four body sections will be the same length. If her essay has to be 5000 words total, how long is each section?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nFirst find the length of the conclusion by tripling the length of the introduction: 450 words * 3 = <<450*3=1350>>1350 words\nThen subtract the length of the introduction and conclusion from the total length to find the combined length of the body sections: 5000 words - 1350 words - 450 words = <<5000-1350-450=3200>>3200 words\nThen divide the combined length of the body section by the number of body sections to find the length of each section: 3200 words / 4 sections = <<3200/4=800>>800 words/section The answer is 800.\n\n\nQ: When Jason plays the video game, Duty for Ashes, his mission to slay the dragon hoard requires that he fire his weapon on average every 15 seconds.   And each time he fires his weapon, his power-fire setting allows him to shoot a flame for 5 seconds.  On average, how many seconds per minute does Jason shoot flames at the dragon hoard?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nSince he fires his weapon on average every 15 seconds, then in one minute he fires the flamethrower 60/15=<<60/15=4>>4 times.\nAnd since each time he fires his weapon, he shoots flame for 5 seconds, then Jason shoots flames at the dragon hoard a total of 4*5=<<4*5=20>>20 seconds of every minute. The answer is 20.\n\n\n"
