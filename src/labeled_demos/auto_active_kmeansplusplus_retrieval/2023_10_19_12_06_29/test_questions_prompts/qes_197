  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Dylan's mother is throwing a baby shower for her best friend. She is expecting 40 guests, of whom she has cleared the parking lot to park in to, leaving only her car and her husband's jeep in the parking lot. The 40 guests, though, arrive in only 10 cars that they park in the parking lot.  If each car has 4 wheels, how many car wheels are there in the parking lot, including both of Dylan's parent's car wheels?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many wheels the 10 cars have in total. Since each car has 4 wheels, we can multiply 10 by 4 to get: 10 x 4 = 40 So, the 10 cars have a total of 40 wheels. Next, we need to add the wheels of Dylan's parent's cars. Since we know they have one car and one jeep, we can calculate the total number of wheels by adding the number of wheels for each vehicle. A car has 4 wheels and a jeep has 4 wheels, so we can add: 4 + 4 = 8 Therefore, there are a total of 40 + 8 = 48 wheels in the parking lot, including both of Dylan's parent's car wheels. The answer is 48.\n\n\nQ: A train leaves its departure station with 6 coal cars, 12 iron cars, and 2 wood cars. Between each station, there are 6 miles, and it takes 25 minutes to travel between them. At each station, the train can deposit up to 2 coal cars, 3 iron cars, and 1 wood car. How many minutes will it take to deliver all the cars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find the total number of cars the train has: 6 coal cars + 12 iron cars + 2 wood cars = 20 cars Next, let's find the maximum number of cars the train can deposit at each station: 2 coal cars + 3 iron cars + 1 wood car = 6 cars To deliver all 20 cars, the train will need to make multiple trips between stations. For each trip, the train can deposit 6 cars. So, the number of trips the train will need to make is: 20 cars \u00f7 6 cars per trip = 3.33 trips Since the train cannot make a partial trip, it will need to make 4 trips. Each trip takes 25 minutes, so the total time it will take to deliver all the cars is: 4 trips x 25 minutes per trip = 100 minutes The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Hammond carves life-sized statues out of marble. His latest set of four statues started with an 80-pound block of marble. The first statue he carved weighed 10 pounds. The second statue weighed 18. The remaining two statues weighed the same amount. The marble he discarded after carving it off the statues weighed 22 pounds. How much did each of the remaining statues Hammond carved weigh?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total weight of the first two statues. The first statue weighed 10 pounds and the second statue weighed 18 pounds, so the total weight of the first two statues is 10 + 18 = 28 pounds. Step 2: Find the weight of the discarded marble. The discarded marble weighed 22 pounds. Step 3: Find the weight of the remaining marble. The weight of the remaining marble is the difference between the weight of the original block of marble and the weight of the discarded marble. So, the weight of the remaining marble is 80 - 22 = 58 pounds. Step 4: Find the weight of each of the remaining statues. The remaining two statues weighed the same amount, so we can divide the weight of the remaining marble by 2 to find the weight of each statue. 58 / 2 = 29 pounds. Therefore, each of the remaining statues Hammond carved weighed 29 pounds. The answer is 29.\n\n\nQ: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of 18 watermelons. Since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, the total weight of 18 watermelons would be: 23 x 18 = 414 pounds Next, we need to find the total amount of money Farmer Kent would make by selling these watermelons. Since he sells them for $2 a pound, we can multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 414 x $2 = $828 Therefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: A car driving cross-country traveled 180 miles in 4 hours. At this rate of speed, how many miles further will the car travel in the next 3 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the car's speed in miles per hour (mph). To do this, we divide the distance traveled by the time taken: Speed = Distance \u00f7 Time Speed = 180 miles \u00f7 4 hours Speed = 45 mph Now that we know the car's speed, we can use it to calculate how far it will travel in the next 3 hours: Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time Distance = 45 mph \u00d7 3 hours Distance = 135 miles Therefore, the car will travel 135 miles further in the next 3 hours. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Parker went to the gym and found 4 twenty pounds dumbbells set up for weightlifting. He added two more dumbbells to the setup and started his exercises. How many pounds of dumbbells is Parker using for his exercises?\nA: Let's think step by step. Parker started with 4 twenty pounds dumbbells, which means he was using 4 x 20 = 80 pounds of dumbbells for his exercises. Then he added two more dumbbells, but we don't know how much each of them weighs. Let's call the weight of each new dumbbell \"x\". So now Parker is using a total of (4 + 2) dumbbells, which is 6 dumbbells in total. The weight of each dumbbell is either 20 pounds (the original ones) or x pounds (the new ones). Therefore, the total weight of dumbbells that Parker is using for his exercises is: 80 + 2x We don't know the value of x, so we can't calculate the exact weight. But we do know that it's at least 20 pounds (since the original dumbbells were 20 pounds each). The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: James gets paid $0.50/mile to drive a truck carrying hazardous waste. He has to pay $4.00/gallon for gas and his truck gets 20 miles per gallon. How much profit does he make from a 600 mile trip?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how many gallons of gas James will need for the trip. To do this, we divide the total distance by the truck's gas mileage: 600 miles \u00f7 20 miles per gallon = 30 gallons of gas Next, we need to calculate how much James will spend on gas: 30 gallons x $4.00 per gallon = $120.00 Now we can calculate how much James will earn from the trip: 600 miles x $0.50 per mile = $300.00 Finally, we can calculate James' profit by subtracting the cost of gas from his earnings: $300.00 - $120.00 = $180.00 Therefore, James will make a profit of $180.00 from a 600 mile trip. The answer is 600.\n\n\nQ: John is working as an IT specialist. He repairs broken computers. One day he had to fix 20 computers. 20% of them were unfixable, and 40% of them needed to wait a few days for spare parts to come. The rest John was able to fix right away. How many computers John was able to fix right away?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many computers were unfixable. We know that 20% of 20 computers were unfixable, so we can calculate: 20% of 20 = 0.2 x 20 = 4 So, John couldn't fix 4 computers. Next, we need to find out how many computers needed to wait for spare parts. We know that 40% of 20 computers needed to wait, so we can calculate: 40% of 20 = 0.4 x 20 = 8 So, 8 computers needed to wait for spare parts. Now, we can subtract the unfixable and waiting computers from the total to find out how many John was able to fix right away: 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 Therefore, John was able to fix 8 computers right away. The answer is 8.\n\n\n"
