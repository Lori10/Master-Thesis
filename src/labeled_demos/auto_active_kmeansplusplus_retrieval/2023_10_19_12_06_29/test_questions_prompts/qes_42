  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Phoebe has two pizzas to share with her and three friends. One has pepperoni and the other has cheese. They both have 16 slices. They all eat the same amount. One friend eats only pepperoni, while the rest have an equal number of slices of each. At the end, there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese, how many slices does each person eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 2 pizzas with 16 slices each, so there are a total of 32 slices. Next, we know that one friend only eats pepperoni, so they eat one slice from the pepperoni pizza. That leaves 31 slices, with 15 slices from each pizza. We also know that there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese left. So, the remaining 15 slices are divided equally among the remaining 3 friends, which means each of them eats 5 slices. Therefore, each person eats 1 slice of pepperoni and 5 slices of cheese. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Last night Kannon had 3 apples, a banana, and 4 oranges for dinner. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, and twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today. How many fruits would she have eaten so far in the two meals?\nA: Let's think step by step. Last night Kannon had 3 apples, 1 banana, and 4 oranges, so she had a total of 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 fruits. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, which means she will have 3 + 4 = 7 apples today. She is also planning to have 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, which means she will have 1 x 10 = 10 bananas today. Finally, she is planning to have twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today, which means she will have 7 x 2 = 14 oranges today. Therefore, in total, Kannon will have eaten 7 + 10 + 14 = 31 fruits in the two meals. The answer is 31.\n\n\nQ: Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Phill cuts the pizza in half, which gives him 2 slices. Then he cuts both halves in half, which gives him 4 slices. And then he cuts each slice in half again, which gives him 8 slices in total. Next, Phill passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends, which means he gives away 3 slices in total. He also passes out 2 slices to 2 of his friends, which means he gives away 4 slices in total. Therefore, Phill has given away a total of 7 slices of pizza. If he started with 8 slices, then he has 1 slice left for himself. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: James takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces.  He splits the pieces between 4 people.  If an orange has 80 calories how many calories does each person get?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pieces James has in total. He takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces, so he has 5 x 8 = 40 pieces in total. Next, we need to divide the pieces between 4 people. To do this, we can divide the total number of pieces by 4: 40 \u00f7 4 = 10 pieces per person. Finally, we need to find out how many calories each person gets. We know that one orange has 80 calories, so each piece has 80 \u00f7 8 = 10 calories. Therefore, each person gets 10 x 10 = 100 calories. So each person gets 100 calories. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: A snail kite is a kind of bird that eats apple snails. On the first day, a snail kite ate 3 snails. Then it eats 2 more snails than it did the day before. How many apple snails in all did a snail kite eat for 5 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, the snail kite ate 3 snails. On the second day, it ate 2 more snails than the day before, so it ate 3 + 2 = 5 snails. On the third day, it ate 2 more snails than the day before, so it ate 5 + 2 = 7 snails. On the fourth day, it ate 2 more snails than the day before, so it ate 7 + 2 = 9 snails. On the fifth day, it ate 2 more snails than the day before, so it ate 9 + 2 = 11 snails. To find the total number of snails the snail kite ate for 5 days, we add up the number of snails it ate each day: 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 35. Therefore, the snail kite ate 35 apple snails in all for 5 days. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: GiGi took out a big bowl of mushrooms from the refrigerator.  She cut each mushroom into 4 pieces.  Her twins, Kenny and Karla sprinkled mushrooms on their pizzas and baked them in the oven.  Kenny grabbed a handful and sprinkled 38 mushroom pieces on his pizza.  Karla scooped them up with both hands and sprinkled 42 mushroom pieces on her pizza.  On the cutting board, were 8 pieces of mushrooms remaining.  How many mushrooms did GiGi cut up at the beginning?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that GiGi cut up a certain number of mushrooms into 4 pieces each. Let's call the total number of mushrooms she cut up \"x\". Next, we know that Kenny sprinkled 38 mushroom pieces on his pizza. Since each mushroom was cut into 4 pieces, this means he used 38/4 = 9.5 mushrooms. However, since he can't use half a mushroom, we know he used 9 mushrooms. Similarly, Karla used 42/4 = 10.5 mushrooms, but since she can't use half a mushroom, we know she used 10 mushrooms. So far, we know that Kenny and Karla used a total of 9+10 = 19 mushrooms. Finally, we know that there were 8 pieces of mushrooms left on the cutting board. Since each mushroom was cut into 4 pieces, this means there were 8/4 = 2 mushrooms left. To find the total number of mushrooms GiGi cut up at the beginning, we can add up the number of mushrooms used by Kenny and Karla, plus the number of mushrooms left on the cutting board: x = 19 + 2 = 21 Therefore, GiGi cut up 21 mushrooms at the beginning. The answer is 21.\n\n\nQ: At Penny\u2019s bakery, her famous blueberry cheesecakes are $7 a slice.  Each cheesecake pie is cut into 6 thick slices.  If she sells 7 cheesecake pies, how much money does she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of cheesecake Penny has in total. Since each cheesecake pie is cut into 6 slices, we can multiply 6 by the number of cheesecake pies she sold: 6 slices/pie x 7 pies = 42 slices So Penny sold 42 slices of blueberry cheesecake. Next, we need to find out how much money she made from selling those 42 slices. Each slice costs $7, so we can multiply 7 by the number of slices: $7/slice x 42 slices = $294 Therefore, Penny made $294 from selling 7 cheesecake pies. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Seth bought some boxes of oranges. He gave a box to his mother. He then gave away half of the remaining boxes. If Seth has 4 boxes of oranges left, how many boxes did he buy in the first place?\nA: Let's think step by step. 1. Seth gave a box to his mother, so he had x-1 boxes left. 2. He then gave away half of the remaining boxes, which means he gave away (x-1)/2 boxes. 3. After giving away half of the remaining boxes, he had 4 boxes left. So, we can set up an equation: (x-1)/2 = x-4 4. Solving for x, we can simplify the equation: x-1 = 2(x-4) -> x-1 = 2x-8 -> x = 7 Therefore, Seth bought 7 boxes of oranges in the first place. The answer is 7.\n\n\n"
