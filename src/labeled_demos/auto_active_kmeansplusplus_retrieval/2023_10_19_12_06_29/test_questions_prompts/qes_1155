  "formatted_prompt": "Q: To make fried green tomatoes, Thelma cuts each green tomato into 8 slices before cooking them up.  If 20 slices of fried green tomato make a meal for a single person, how many tomatoes will Thelma need to make enough fried green tomatoes to feed a family of 8 for a single meal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many slices of fried green tomatoes are needed for a family of 8 for a single meal. We know that 20 slices make a meal for a single person, so for 8 people, we need: 20 slices/person x 8 people = 160 slices Next, we need to figure out how many tomatoes are needed to make 160 slices. We know that Thelma cuts each tomato into 8 slices, so: 160 slices \u00f7 8 slices/tomato = 20 tomatoes Therefore, Thelma will need 20 tomatoes to make enough fried green tomatoes to feed a family of 8 for a single meal. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: There are four growing trees. The first tree grows 1 meter/day, the second grows the same amount in half the time, the third grows 2 meters/day, and the fourth tree grows a meter more than the third each day. How many meters did the trees grow in total in 4 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much the second tree grows per day. Since it grows the same amount as the first tree in half the time, it grows 2 meters/day. Now we can calculate how much each tree grows in 4 days: - The first tree grows 1 meter/day, so in 4 days it grows 4 meters. - The second tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The third tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The fourth tree grows 1 meter more than the third each day, so it grows 3 meters/day. In 4 days it grows 12 meters. Adding up the growth of all four trees, we get: 4 + 8 + 8 + 12 = 32 meters Therefore, the trees grew a total of 32 meters in 4 days. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: GiGi took out a big bowl of mushrooms from the refrigerator.  She cut each mushroom into 4 pieces.  Her twins, Kenny and Karla sprinkled mushrooms on their pizzas and baked them in the oven.  Kenny grabbed a handful and sprinkled 38 mushroom pieces on his pizza.  Karla scooped them up with both hands and sprinkled 42 mushroom pieces on her pizza.  On the cutting board, were 8 pieces of mushrooms remaining.  How many mushrooms did GiGi cut up at the beginning?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that GiGi cut up a certain number of mushrooms into 4 pieces each. Let's call the total number of mushrooms she cut up \"x\". Next, we know that Kenny sprinkled 38 mushroom pieces on his pizza. Since each mushroom was cut into 4 pieces, this means he used 38/4 = 9.5 mushrooms. However, since he can't use half a mushroom, we know he used 9 mushrooms. Similarly, Karla used 42/4 = 10.5 mushrooms, but since she can't use half a mushroom, we know she used 10 mushrooms. So far, we know that Kenny and Karla used a total of 9+10 = 19 mushrooms. Finally, we know that there were 8 pieces of mushrooms left on the cutting board. Since each mushroom was cut into 4 pieces, this means there were 8/4 = 2 mushrooms left. To find the total number of mushrooms GiGi cut up at the beginning, we can add up the number of mushrooms used by Kenny and Karla, plus the number of mushrooms left on the cutting board: x = 19 + 2 = 21 Therefore, GiGi cut up 21 mushrooms at the beginning. The answer is 21.\n\n\nQ: Patricia is growing her long very long to donate it to a charity that makes wigs for cancer survivors. Her hair is 14 inches long. She needs to donate 23 inches to make a wig. She wants her hair to be 12 inches long after the donation. How much longer does she have to grow her hair?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much hair Patricia needs to donate to reach the required 23 inches. 23 inches - 14 inches = 9 inches So, Patricia needs to grow her hair 9 more inches to reach the required length for donation. Next, we need to find out how much hair Patricia will have left after the donation. 14 inches - 9 inches = 5 inches So, Patricia will have 5 inches of hair left after the donation. Finally, we need to find out how much longer Patricia needs to grow her hair to reach her desired length of 12 inches. 12 inches - 5 inches = 7 inches Therefore, Patricia needs to grow her hair 7 more inches to reach her desired length after the donation. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: James has a small tree outside his window with 30 branches with 90 twigs per branch. 30% of the twigs sprout 4 leaves and the rest sprout 5 leaves. How many leaves are on the tree total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of twigs on the tree. We know that there are 30 branches with 90 twigs per branch, so: 30 branches x 90 twigs per branch = 2700 twigs Next, we need to find how many twigs sprout 4 leaves and how many sprout 5 leaves. We know that 30% of the twigs sprout 4 leaves, so: 30% of 2700 twigs = 0.3 x 2700 = 810 twigs sprout 4 leaves The remaining twigs sprout 5 leaves: 2700 twigs - 810 twigs = 1890 twigs sprout 5 leaves Now we can find the total number of leaves on the tree. Each twig that sprouts 4 leaves contributes 4 leaves, and each twig that sprouts 5 leaves contributes 5 leaves. So: 810 twigs x 4 leaves per twig = 3240 leaves from twigs that sprout 4 leaves 1890 twigs x 5 leaves per twig = 9450 leaves from twigs that sprout 5 leaves The total number of leaves on the tree is: 3240 leaves + 9450 leaves = 12690 leaves Therefore, there are 12690 leaves on the tree in total. The answer is 12690.\n\n\nQ: If a circle has a radius of 14 feet, how many 6-inch pencils can be placed end-to-end across the diameter of the circle?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the diameter of the circle. The diameter is twice the radius, so: Diameter = 2 x Radius Diameter = 2 x 14 feet Diameter = 28 feet Next, we need to convert the length of the pencils from inches to feet, since the diameter is in feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so: Length of pencil in feet = 6 inches / 12 inches per foot Length of pencil in feet = 0.5 feet Now we can find how many pencils can be placed end-to-end across the diameter of the circle. We simply divide the diameter by the length of one pencil: Number of pencils = Diameter / Length of one pencil Number of pencils = 28 feet / 0.5 feet Number of pencils = 56 pencils Therefore, 56 6-inch pencils can be placed end-to-end across the diameter of the circle. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Jenny lives 5000 feet from her school, and every day she walks home.  One day as she was walking home from school, she dropped 1 kernel of popcorn per 25 feet she walked.  Later that evening, a squirrel came and ate one-quarter of the popcorn Jenny had dropped on her way home.  If Jenny walks to school the following morning and counts the popcorn on the ground, what is the total number of popcorn kernels she will find remaining on the ground?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many kernels of popcorn Jenny dropped on her way home. To do this, we can divide the distance she walked (5000 feet) by the distance per kernel (25 feet per kernel): 5000 feet / 25 feet per kernel = 200 kernels of popcorn Next, we need to find out how many kernels of popcorn the squirrel ate. To do this, we can multiply the total number of kernels by one-quarter: 200 kernels x 1/4 = 50 kernels of popcorn eaten by the squirrel Finally, we can subtract the number of kernels eaten by the squirrel from the total number of kernels dropped by Jenny to find the number of kernels remaining on the ground: 200 kernels - 50 kernels = 150 kernels of popcorn remaining on the ground Therefore, Jenny will find 150 kernels of popcorn remaining on the ground when she walks to school the following morning. The answer is 150.\n\n\nQ: Cynthia wants floor-to-ceiling curtains made with an additional 5\" of material so it will pool at the bottom. If her room is 8 feet tall, how long will the curtains need to be?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 8 feet to inches since the additional 5 inches will be added to the length. 8 feet = 96 inches Next, we add the additional 5 inches: 96 inches + 5 inches = 101 inches Therefore, the curtains will need to be 101 inches long. The answer is 101.\n\n\n"
