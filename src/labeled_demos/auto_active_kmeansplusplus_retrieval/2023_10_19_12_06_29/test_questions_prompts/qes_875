  "formatted_prompt": "Q: James gets paid $0.50/mile to drive a truck carrying hazardous waste. He has to pay $4.00/gallon for gas and his truck gets 20 miles per gallon. How much profit does he make from a 600 mile trip?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how many gallons of gas James will need for the trip. To do this, we divide the total distance by the truck's gas mileage: 600 miles \u00f7 20 miles per gallon = 30 gallons of gas Next, we need to calculate how much James will spend on gas: 30 gallons x $4.00 per gallon = $120.00 Now we can calculate how much James will earn from the trip: 600 miles x $0.50 per mile = $300.00 Finally, we can calculate James' profit by subtracting the cost of gas from his earnings: $300.00 - $120.00 = $180.00 Therefore, James will make a profit of $180.00 from a 600 mile trip. The answer is 600.\n\n\nQ: A gallon of whole milk that normally costs $3 is now sold at $2. A box of cereal was sold at a discount of $1. How much will you save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the discount for each gallon of whole milk. The discount is $3 - $2 = $1 per gallon. So, if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk, you will save 3 x $1 = $3. Next, let's calculate the discount for each box of cereal. The discount is $1 per box. So, if you buy 5 boxes of cereal, you will save 5 x $1 = $5. Therefore, the total amount you will save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal is $3 + $5 = $8. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Carson runs a carpool for five of his friends. The five of them cover all the gas expenses to compensate Carson for his time. Their total commute is 21 miles one way, gas costs $2.50/gallon, Carson's car gets 30 miles/gallon, and they commute to work 5 days a week, 4 weeks a month. How much does each person pay toward gas monthly?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per day. Since they commute 21 miles one way, their round trip is 21 x 2 = 42 miles. Next, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per week. They commute 42 miles per day, and they commute 5 days a week, so they commute 42 x 5 = 210 miles per week. Then, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per month. They commute 210 miles per week, and they commute 4 weeks a month, so they commute 210 x 4 = 840 miles per month. Now, we need to find out how many gallons of gas they need per month. Carson's car gets 30 miles per gallon, and they commute 840 miles per month, so they need 840/30 = 28 gallons of gas per month. Finally, we need to find out how much each person pays toward gas monthly. The total cost of gas is $2.50 per gallon, and they need 28 gallons of gas per month, so the total cost of gas is 2.5 x 28 = $70 per month. Since there are 6 people in the carpool (Carson and his 5 friends), each person pays 70/6 = $11.67 toward gas monthly. The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: Frank's laundry detergent is double concentrated and will wash 80 loads of laundry.  His detergent is usually $25.00 a bottle but they're having a sale.  If he buys 2 bottles, both bottles will drop to $20.00 a bottle.  How much does he spend, in cents, per load of laundry, if he buys 2 bottles of detergent?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the cost of one bottle of detergent during the sale: $25.00 - $20.00 = $5.00 discount per bottle $25.00 - $5.00 = $20.00 per bottle during the sale Since Frank buys 2 bottles during the sale, he spends: 2 bottles x $20.00 per bottle = $40.00 Now, let's calculate the cost per load of laundry: $40.00 for 2 bottles x 80 loads per bottle = 160 loads $40.00 for 160 loads = $0.25 per load Therefore, Frank spends 25 cents per load of laundry if he buys 2 bottles of detergent during the sale. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how much money Carl will earn in four weeks. If he earns $0.50 every time, and he buys a candy bar each time, that means he's spending $0.50 each week. But he's also earning $0.75 each week for taking out his neighbor's trash. So his net earnings each week are $0.75 - $0.50 = $0.25. Over four weeks, that's a total of $0.25 x 4 = $1. So Carl will have $1 to spend on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.50, he can buy 2 candy bars with his earnings. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Apples used to cost $1.6 per pound.  The price got raised 25%.  How much does it cost to buy 2 pounds of apples for each person in a 4 member family?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Calculate the new price of apples after the 25% increase. The price increase is 25% of $1.6, which is (25/100) x $1.6 = $0.4. So, the new price of apples is $1.6 + $0.4 = $2. Step 2: Calculate the cost of buying 2 pounds of apples for each person in the family. Since there are 4 members in the family, we need to buy 2 x 4 = 8 pounds of apples in total. The cost of buying 1 pound of apples is $2, so the cost of buying 8 pounds of apples is 8 x $2 = $16. Therefore, it would cost $16 to buy 2 pounds of apples for each person in a 4 member family. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Maria wants to paint a picture and needs some tools to do that. She wants to buy a set of brushes for $20 and some canvas for three times more than the brushes. The paint costs Maria $8 per liter, and she needs at least 5 liters. How much money will she earn on the painting if she will be able to sell it for $200?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much Maria will spend on canvas. We know that the canvas will cost three times more than the brushes, which are $20. So, 3 x $20 = $60 for the canvas. Next, let's calculate how much Maria will spend on paint. She needs at least 5 liters, and each liter costs $8. So, 5 x $8 = $40 for the paint. Now, let's add up all of Maria's expenses: $20 for brushes + $60 for canvas + $40 for paint = $120 total expenses. If Maria sells the painting for $200, she will earn $200 - $120 = $80 profit. The answer is 80.\n\n\nQ: Logan makes $65,000 a year. He spends $20,000 on rent every year, $5000 on groceries every year, and $8000 on gas every year. If he wants to have at least $42000 left, how much more money must he make each year?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how much Logan spends in total each year: $20,000 (rent) + $5,000 (groceries) + $8,000 (gas) = $33,000 Next, we need to subtract that amount from his annual income: $65,000 (income) - $33,000 (expenses) = $32,000 So Logan currently has $32,000 left after paying his expenses. However, he wants to have at least $42,000 left. Therefore, we need to calculate how much more money he needs to make each year: $42,000 (desired savings) - $32,000 (current savings) = $10,000 Therefore, Logan needs to make at least $10,000 more each year to reach his desired savings goal. The answer is 10000.\n\n\n"
