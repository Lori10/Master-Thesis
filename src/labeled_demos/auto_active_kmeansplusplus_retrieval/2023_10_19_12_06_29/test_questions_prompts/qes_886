  "test_question": "Q: Vincent can buy flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 or in packages of 2 for $1. How much money does he save by buying 18 flowers at the better price?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A gallon of whole milk that normally costs $3 is now sold at $2. A box of cereal was sold at a discount of $1. How much will you save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the discount for each gallon of whole milk. The discount is $3 - $2 = $1 per gallon. So, if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk, you will save 3 x $1 = $3. Next, let's calculate the discount for each box of cereal. The discount is $1 per box. So, if you buy 5 boxes of cereal, you will save 5 x $1 = $5. Therefore, the total amount you will save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal is $3 + $5 = $8. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Claire wants to make 2 cakes for her mother. Two packages of flour are required for making a cake. If 1 package of flour is $3, how much does she pay for the flour that is enough to make 2 cakes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine how many packages of flour Claire needs to make 2 cakes. Since 2 packages of flour are required for making 1 cake, Claire needs 2 x 2 = 4 packages of flour to make 2 cakes. Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the flour. Since 1 package of flour costs $3, 4 packages of flour will cost 4 x $3 = $12. Therefore, Claire will pay $12 for the flour that is enough to make 2 cakes. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Fran\u00e7oise sells pots of lily of the valley to fund humanitarian work. She buys them at \u20ac12 each and sells them at a 25% higher cost. How much will she give back to the association by selling 150 pots of lily of the valley?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the selling price of each pot of lily of the valley. Fran\u00e7oise sells them at a 25% higher cost than the buying price of \u20ac12, so we need to add 25% of \u20ac12 to \u20ac12: 25% of \u20ac12 = 0.25 x \u20ac12 = \u20ac3 Selling price = \u20ac12 + \u20ac3 = \u20ac15 Now we know that Fran\u00e7oise sells each pot of lily of the valley for \u20ac15. To calculate how much she will give back to the association by selling 150 pots, we need to multiply the selling price by the number of pots sold: \u20ac15 x 150 = \u20ac2250 Therefore, Fran\u00e7oise will give back \u20ac2250 to the association by selling 150 pots of lily of the valley. The answer is 150.\n\n\nQ: A flower shop sells bouquets of roses, which each contain 12 roses, and bouquets of daisies, which each contain an equal amount of daisies. The flower shop sells 20 bouquets today. 10 of these were rose bouquets and the remaining 10 bouquets were daisy bouquets. If the flower shop has sold 190 flowers in total today, how many daisies are in each bouquet of daisies?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the flower shop sold 10 bouquets of roses, each containing 12 roses, so they sold a total of 10 x 12 = 120 roses. Next, we know that the flower shop sold 10 bouquets of daisies, and we want to find out how many daisies are in each bouquet. Let's call the number of daisies in each bouquet \"d\". So, the flower shop sold a total of 10 x d = 10d daisies. We also know that the flower shop sold a total of 190 flowers in total today, so: 120 (roses) + 10d (daisies) = 190 Simplifying this equation, we get: 10d = 70 Dividing both sides by 10, we get: d = 7 Therefore, each bouquet of daisies contains 7 daisies. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of 18 watermelons. Since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, the total weight of 18 watermelons would be: 23 x 18 = 414 pounds Next, we need to find the total amount of money Farmer Kent would make by selling these watermelons. Since he sells them for $2 a pound, we can multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 414 x $2 = $828 Therefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Since 1989, Lily has treated herself to 1 hydrangea plant, each year.  Each plant costs $20.00.  By 2021, how much money has Lily spent on hydrangeas?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many years it has been since 1989 to 2021. 2021 - 1989 = 32 years So, Lily has been treating herself to 1 hydrangea plant every year for 32 years. Next, we need to find out how much money Lily has spent on hydrangeas. 1 plant costs $20.00, so: 32 years x $20.00 per plant = $640.00 Therefore, Lily has spent $640.00 on hydrangeas since 1989. The answer is 1989.\n\n\nQ: Marco has $24. Mary has $15. If Marco gives Mary half of what he has, Mary will have more than Marco. But Mary spends $5. How much more money does Mary have than Marco?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much money Marco gives to Mary. Since Marco has $24, half of that would be $12. So, Marco gives $12 to Mary. After receiving $12 from Marco, Mary will have $15 + $12 = $27. However, Mary spends $5, so we need to subtract that from her total. $27 - $5 = $22. Therefore, Mary has $22 more than Marco. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Frank's laundry detergent is double concentrated and will wash 80 loads of laundry.  His detergent is usually $25.00 a bottle but they're having a sale.  If he buys 2 bottles, both bottles will drop to $20.00 a bottle.  How much does he spend, in cents, per load of laundry, if he buys 2 bottles of detergent?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the cost of one bottle of detergent during the sale: $25.00 - $20.00 = $5.00 discount per bottle $25.00 - $5.00 = $20.00 per bottle during the sale Since Frank buys 2 bottles during the sale, he spends: 2 bottles x $20.00 per bottle = $40.00 Now, let's calculate the cost per load of laundry: $40.00 for 2 bottles x 80 loads per bottle = 160 loads $40.00 for 160 loads = $0.25 per load Therefore, Frank spends 25 cents per load of laundry if he buys 2 bottles of detergent during the sale. The answer is 2.\n\n\n"
