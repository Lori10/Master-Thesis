  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Karina was born in 1970 and she is currently twice as old as her brother. If her current age is 40, in what year was her brother born?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Karina's current age is 40. We also know that she is currently twice as old as her brother. Therefore, we can set up an equation: 40 = 2x where x is her brother's current age. Solving for x, we get: x = 20 So Karina's brother is currently 20 years old. Next, we need to figure out in what year he was born. We know that Karina was born in 1970, so we can subtract her brother's age from that year: 1970 - 20 = 1950 Therefore, Karina's brother was born in 1950. The answer is 1950.\n\n\nQ: Tom turned 32 years old 5 years ago.  7 years ago Jim was 5 years older than half Tom's age.  How old is Jim in 2 years?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find Tom's current age. We know that he turned 32 years old 5 years ago, so we can add 32 and 5 to get his current age: Tom's current age = 32 + 5 = 37 Next, we need to figure out how old Jim was 7 years ago. We know that 7 years ago, Jim was 5 years older than half of Tom's age. Half of Tom's age is: 37 / 2 = 18.5 So 7 years ago, Jim was: 18.5 + 5 = 23.5 Now we need to find Jim's current age. We know that 7 years have passed since we calculated Jim's age, so we need to add 7 to his age: Jim's current age = 23.5 + 7 = 30.5 Finally, we need to find Jim's age in 2 years. We can simply add 2 to his current age: Jim's age in 2 years = 30.5 + 2 = 32.5 Therefore, Jim will be 32.5 years old in 2 years. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Darcie is 4 years old. She is 1/6 as old as her mother and her mother is 4/5 as old as her father. How old is her father?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can use algebra to represent Darcie's mother's age in terms of Darcie's age. Let's call Darcie's mother's age \"M\". We know that Darcie is 1/6 as old as her mother, so we can write: Darcie's age = 1/6 x Darcie's mother's age 4 = 1/6M Next, we can use algebra to represent Darcie's father's age in terms of Darcie's mother's age. Let's call Darcie's father's age \"F\". We know that Darcie's mother is 4/5 as old as her father, so we can write: Darcie's mother's age = 4/5 x Darcie's father's age M = 4/5F Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for F: 4 = 1/6M 4 = 1/6(4/5F) 4 = 2/15F F = 30 Therefore, Darcie's father is 30 years old. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: James writes a comic every other day for 4 years. If there was no leap year, how many comics has he written?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days there are in 4 years. Since there are 365 days in a year, we can multiply 365 by 4 to get: 365 x 4 = 1460 days Next, we need to figure out how many comics James writes in every other day. Since he writes a comic every other day, we can divide the total number of days by 2 to get: 1460 / 2 = 730 comics Therefore, James has written 730 comics in 4 years if there was no leap year. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Four classmates were comparing their ages based on their birth month. They found out that Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese while Therese is 5 months older than Aivo. Then, Leon is 2 months older than Aivo. How much older in months is Jolyn than Leon?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine the age difference between Aivo and Therese. We know that Therese is 5 months older than Aivo. Next, we need to determine the age difference between Jolyn and Therese. We know that Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese. Then, we need to determine the age difference between Leon and Aivo. We know that Leon is 2 months older than Aivo. To find the age difference between Jolyn and Leon, we need to add up the age differences between Jolyn and Therese, Therese and Aivo, and Aivo and Leon. (2 months + 5 months + 2 months) = 9 months Therefore, Jolyn is 9 months older than Leon. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Tonya is buying Christmas gifts for her sisters. She has 2 sisters and wants to spend the exact same amount on each. She buys her younger sister 4 dolls that cost $15 each. She plans to buy lego sets for her older sister. They cost $20 each. How many lego sets does she buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much Tonya spent on dolls for her younger sister. She bought 4 dolls that cost $15 each, so she spent: 4 x $15 = $60 Since Tonya wants to spend the same amount on each sister, she needs to spend $60 on lego sets for her older sister as well. Each lego set costs $20, so she needs to buy: $60 \u00f7 $20 = 3 lego sets Therefore, Tonya needs to buy 3 lego sets for her older sister. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Jill spends time every day talking to her boyfriend on the phone.  The first day of the week she spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend.  Each of the following days she spends twice as much time talking on the phone as the day before. After the 5th day her parents take the phone away from her because she was on it too long.  How much time did Jill spend talking to her boyfriend that week?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Jill spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend. On the second day, she spends twice as much time as the first day, which is 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 minutes. On the third day, she spends twice as much time as the second day, which is 2*10=<<2*10=20>>20 minutes. On the fourth day, she spends twice as much time as the third day, which is 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 minutes. On the fifth day, she spends twice as much time as the fourth day, which is 2*40=<<2*40=80>>80 minutes. Therefore, Jill spends a total of 5+10+20+40+80=<<5+10+20+40+80=155>>155 minutes talking to her boyfriend that week. The answer is 155.\n\n\nQ: Marco has $24. Mary has $15. If Marco gives Mary half of what he has, Mary will have more than Marco. But Mary spends $5. How much more money does Mary have than Marco?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much money Marco gives to Mary. Since Marco has $24, half of that would be $12. So, Marco gives $12 to Mary. After receiving $12 from Marco, Mary will have $15 + $12 = $27. However, Mary spends $5, so we need to subtract that from her total. $27 - $5 = $22. Therefore, Mary has $22 more than Marco. The answer is 22.\n\n\n"
