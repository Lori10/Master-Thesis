  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Two-thirds of the class have brown eyes. Half of the students with brown eyes have black hair. If there are 6 students in the class with brown eyes and black hair, how many students are there in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that two-thirds of the class have brown eyes. Let's represent the total number of students in the class as \"x\". Then, we can write: (2/3)x = number of students with brown eyes Next, we know that half of the students with brown eyes have black hair. So, we can take half of the number of students with brown eyes to find the number of students with both brown eyes and black hair: (1/2)(2/3)x = 6 Simplifying this equation, we get: (1/3)x = 6 Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: x = 18 Therefore, there are 18 students in total. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: In a school, the number of participants in the 2018 Science Quiz Bowl was 150. There were 20 more than twice the number of participants in 2019 as there were in 2018. In 2020, the number of participants was 40 less than half the number of participants in 2019. How many more participants were there in 2019 than in 2020?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many participants there were in 2019. We know that there were 20 more than twice the number of participants in 2018, so we can set up an equation: 2019 participants = 20 + 2 * 2018 participants 2019 participants = 20 + 2 * 150 2019 participants = 320 Next, we need to find out how many participants there were in 2020. We know that the number of participants in 2020 was 40 less than half the number of participants in 2019, so we can set up another equation: 2020 participants = 0.5 * 2019 participants - 40 2020 participants = 0.5 * 320 - 40 2020 participants = 80 Finally, we can find out how many more participants there were in 2019 than in 2020: 2019 participants - 2020 participants = 320 - 80 = 240 Therefore, there were 240 more participants in 2019 than in 2020. The answer is 2020.\n\n\nQ: Ryan works in an office that has an even number of men and women working there.  Ryan participates in a meeting composed of 4 men and 6 women who are pulled from the office floor.   This reduces the number of women working on the office floor by 20%.  How many people work at Ryan's office?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the number of men and women in the office is even. Let's call this number \"x\". Next, we know that 4 men and 6 women were pulled from the office floor for the meeting. This means that there are now x-4 men and x-6 women still working on the office floor. We also know that the number of women on the office floor decreased by 20%. This means that the new number of women on the office floor is 0.8(x-6). Since we know that the number of men and women in the office is even, we can set up an equation: x-4 + 0.8(x-6) = x Simplifying this equation: 0.8x - 1.2 = 0 0.8x = 1.2 x = 1.2/0.8 x = 1.5 Since we know that x is an even number, the closest even number to 1.5 is 2. Therefore, there are 2 men and 2 women working at Ryan's office. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: There are 50 marbles in a box which has a mixture of white, red and blue marbles. There were originally 20 white marbles and an equal number of red and blue marbles. Jack removes a number of marbles equal to double the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles. How many marbles are left in the box?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 20 white marbles and an equal number of red and blue marbles. So, we can say that there are 20 white, 15 red, and 15 blue marbles in the box. Next, we need to find the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles. In this case, the difference is 20 - 15 = 5. Then, we need to double that difference, which gives us 5 x 2 = 10. Jack removes 10 marbles from the box. So, the number of marbles left in the box is 50 - 10 = 40 marbles. The answer is 40.\n\n\nQ: Forty percent of the students have elected to learn from home during the pandemic. The remaining students are divided into two equal groups, only one of which is physically in school on any day. What percent of students are present in school?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Let's assume that there are 100 students in total. Step 2: 40% of the students have elected to learn from home during the pandemic. So, the number of students learning from home is 40% of 100, which is 40. Step 3: The remaining students are 60 (100 - 40). Step 4: The remaining students are divided into two equal groups, so each group has 30 students. Step 5: Only one of the two groups is physically in school on any day. So, the number of students present in school is 30. Step 6: To find the percentage of students present in school, we need to divide the number of students present in school by the total number of students and multiply by 100. 30/100 x 100 = 30% Therefore, 30% of students are present in school. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: 1,800 fish swim westward, 3,200 swim eastward, and 500 swim north. What is the number of fish left in the sea, if fishers catch 2/5 of the fish that swam eastward and 3/4 of the fish that swam westward?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many fish were caught by the fishers. 2/5 of 3,200 fish that swam eastward is: (2/5) x 3,200 = 1,280 fish 3/4 of 1,800 fish that swam westward is: (3/4) x 1,800 = 1,350 fish So, the total number of fish caught by the fishers is: 1,280 + 1,350 = 2,630 fish Now, we need to subtract the number of fish caught by the fishers from the total number of fish: 1,800 + 3,200 + 500 - 2,630 = 2,870 fish Therefore, there are 2,870 fish left in the sea. The answer is 2870.\n\n\nQ: Jason, Ryan, and Jeffery went fishing at the lake. Ryan caught three times the number of fish that Jason caught. Jefferey caught twice the number of fish that Ryan got.  If Jeffery caught 60 fish, how many fish did all of them catch in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Jeffery caught 60 fish. Next, we know that Jeffery caught twice the number of fish that Ryan caught. So, Ryan must have caught 60/2 = 30 fish. Finally, we know that Ryan caught three times the number of fish that Jason caught. So, Jason must have caught 30/3 = 10 fish. Therefore, the total number of fish caught by all of them is 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 fish. The answer is 100.\n\n\n"
