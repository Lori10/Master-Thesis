  "formatted_prompt": "Q: An airline company owns 5 airplanes. Every airplane they own has 20 rows with 7 seats in each row. Each airplane makes 2 flights a day. How many passengers can the airline company accommodate each day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many seats are in one airplane. We can do this by multiplying the number of rows by the number of seats in each row: 20 rows x 7 seats per row = 140 seats per airplane Next, we need to find out how many passengers can fly on one airplane in a day. Since each airplane makes 2 flights a day, we can multiply the number of seats per airplane by 2: 140 seats per airplane x 2 flights per day = 280 passengers per airplane per day Finally, we need to find out how many passengers the airline company can accommodate in a day with all 5 airplanes: 280 passengers per airplane per day x 5 airplanes = 1,400 passengers per day Therefore, the airline company can accommodate 1,400 passengers each day. The answer is 1400.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: A train leaves its departure station with 6 coal cars, 12 iron cars, and 2 wood cars. Between each station, there are 6 miles, and it takes 25 minutes to travel between them. At each station, the train can deposit up to 2 coal cars, 3 iron cars, and 1 wood car. How many minutes will it take to deliver all the cars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find the total number of cars the train has: 6 coal cars + 12 iron cars + 2 wood cars = 20 cars Next, let's find the maximum number of cars the train can deposit at each station: 2 coal cars + 3 iron cars + 1 wood car = 6 cars To deliver all 20 cars, the train will need to make multiple trips between stations. For each trip, the train can deposit 6 cars. So, the number of trips the train will need to make is: 20 cars \u00f7 6 cars per trip = 3.33 trips Since the train cannot make a partial trip, it will need to make 4 trips. Each trip takes 25 minutes, so the total time it will take to deliver all the cars is: 4 trips x 25 minutes per trip = 100 minutes The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Carson runs a carpool for five of his friends. The five of them cover all the gas expenses to compensate Carson for his time. Their total commute is 21 miles one way, gas costs $2.50/gallon, Carson's car gets 30 miles/gallon, and they commute to work 5 days a week, 4 weeks a month. How much does each person pay toward gas monthly?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per day. Since they commute 21 miles one way, their round trip is 21 x 2 = 42 miles. Next, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per week. They commute 42 miles per day, and they commute 5 days a week, so they commute 42 x 5 = 210 miles per week. Then, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per month. They commute 210 miles per week, and they commute 4 weeks a month, so they commute 210 x 4 = 840 miles per month. Now, we need to find out how many gallons of gas they need per month. Carson's car gets 30 miles per gallon, and they commute 840 miles per month, so they need 840/30 = 28 gallons of gas per month. Finally, we need to find out how much each person pays toward gas monthly. The total cost of gas is $2.50 per gallon, and they need 28 gallons of gas per month, so the total cost of gas is 2.5 x 28 = $70 per month. Since there are 6 people in the carpool (Carson and his 5 friends), each person pays 70/6 = $11.67 toward gas monthly. The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: Francine drives 140km to work each day. If she does not go to work 3 days every week, find the total distance she drives to work for 4 weeks in kilometers.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days Francine goes to work in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 x 7 = 28 days. If Francine does not go to work 3 days every week, then she goes to work 7 - 3 = 4 days every week. So in 4 weeks, she goes to work 4 x 4 = 16 days. Now we can find the total distance she drives to work in 4 weeks by multiplying the distance she drives to work each day by the number of days she goes to work in 4 weeks. Total distance = 140 km/day x 16 days = 2240 km Therefore, Francine drives a total of 2240 kilometers to work in 4 weeks. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Dylan's mother is throwing a baby shower for her best friend. She is expecting 40 guests, of whom she has cleared the parking lot to park in to, leaving only her car and her husband's jeep in the parking lot. The 40 guests, though, arrive in only 10 cars that they park in the parking lot.  If each car has 4 wheels, how many car wheels are there in the parking lot, including both of Dylan's parent's car wheels?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many wheels the 10 cars have in total. Since each car has 4 wheels, we can multiply 10 by 4 to get: 10 x 4 = 40 So, the 10 cars have a total of 40 wheels. Next, we need to add the wheels of Dylan's parent's cars. Since we know they have one car and one jeep, we can calculate the total number of wheels by adding the number of wheels for each vehicle. A car has 4 wheels and a jeep has 4 wheels, so we can add: 4 + 4 = 8 Therefore, there are a total of 40 + 8 = 48 wheels in the parking lot, including both of Dylan's parent's car wheels. The answer is 48.\n\n\nQ: A group of 30 tourists sets out on a walking tour of the rainforest. Two tourists are eaten by anacondas, then half the remaining tourists try to pet poisonous dart frogs and get poisoned. If only 1/7 of the poisoned tourists recovered, how many tourists are left at the end of the tour?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Start with 30 tourists. Step 2: Two tourists are eaten by anacondas, so we subtract 2 from 30 to get 28 tourists remaining. Step 3: Half of the remaining tourists try to pet poisonous dart frogs and get poisoned. Half of 28 is 14, so we subtract 14 from 28 to get 14 tourists remaining. Step 4: Only 1/7 of the poisoned tourists recovered. 1/7 of 14 is 2, so we add 2 to the 14 tourists remaining to get 16 tourists at the end of the tour. Therefore, there are 16 tourists left at the end of the tour. The answer is 16.\n\n\nQ: A bicycle shop owner adds 3 bikes to her stock every week. After 1 month, she had sold 18 bikes but still had 45 bikes in stock. How many bikes did she have originally?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's figure out how many weeks are in a month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of bikes added each week (3) by the number of weeks in a month (4) to find out how many bikes were added in total: 3 bikes/week x 4 weeks/month = 12 bikes/month Next, we can subtract the number of bikes sold (18) from the number of bikes in stock after 1 month (45) to find out how many bikes were in stock before any were sold: 45 bikes - 18 bikes = 27 bikes Finally, we can add the number of bikes added in total (12) to the number of bikes in stock before any were sold (27) to find out how many bikes the shop owner originally had: 27 bikes + 12 bikes = 39 bikes Therefore, the shop owner originally had 39 bikes in stock. The answer is 39.\n\n\n"
