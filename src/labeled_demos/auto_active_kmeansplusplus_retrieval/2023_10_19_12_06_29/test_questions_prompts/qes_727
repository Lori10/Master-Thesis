  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Lorie has 2 pieces of $100 bills. He requested to change one piece of the $100 bills into $50 bills. Half of the remaining $100 bill is changed to $10 bills while the rest is changed to $5 bills. How many pieces of bills will she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Lorie has 2 pieces of $100 bills, which means she has a total of $200. Next, she changes one piece of the $100 bill into $50 bills. One piece of $100 bill is equal to 2 pieces of $50 bills, so she now has a total of $200 - $100 + $100 = $200. Half of the remaining $100 bill is changed to $10 bills. Half of $100 is $50, so she changes $50 into $10 bills. $50 divided by $10 is 5, so she now has 5 pieces of $10 bills. The rest of the remaining $100 bill is changed to $5 bills. The remaining amount is $50, and $50 divided by $5 is 10, so she now has 10 pieces of $5 bills. Therefore, Lorie now has a total of 2 pieces of $50 bills, 5 pieces of $10 bills, and 10 pieces of $5 bills, which is a total of 17 pieces of bills. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: At Penny\u2019s bakery, her famous blueberry cheesecakes are $7 a slice.  Each cheesecake pie is cut into 6 thick slices.  If she sells 7 cheesecake pies, how much money does she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of cheesecake Penny has in total. Since each cheesecake pie is cut into 6 slices, we can multiply 6 by the number of cheesecake pies she sold: 6 slices/pie x 7 pies = 42 slices So Penny sold 42 slices of blueberry cheesecake. Next, we need to find out how much money she made from selling those 42 slices. Each slice costs $7, so we can multiply 7 by the number of slices: $7/slice x 42 slices = $294 Therefore, Penny made $294 from selling 7 cheesecake pies. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Marco has $24. Mary has $15. If Marco gives Mary half of what he has, Mary will have more than Marco. But Mary spends $5. How much more money does Mary have than Marco?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much money Marco gives to Mary. Since Marco has $24, half of that would be $12. So, Marco gives $12 to Mary. After receiving $12 from Marco, Mary will have $15 + $12 = $27. However, Mary spends $5, so we need to subtract that from her total. $27 - $5 = $22. Therefore, Mary has $22 more than Marco. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Dani brings two and half dozen cupcakes for her 2nd-grade class.  There are 27 students (including Dani), 1 teacher, and 1 teacher\u2019s aid.  If 3 students called in sick that day, how many cupcakes are left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Dani brought in total. Two and a half dozen cupcakes is equal to 30 cupcakes (since a dozen is 12). Next, we need to figure out how many people will be receiving cupcakes. There are 27 students, 1 teacher, and 1 teacher's aid, for a total of 29 people. However, 3 students called in sick, so we need to subtract them from the total. 29 - 3 = 26 people receiving cupcakes. Now, we need to subtract 26 cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes Dani brought. 30 - 26 = 4 cupcakes left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Michael has $42. Michael gives away half the money to his brother. His brother then buys 3 dollars worth of candy. If his brother has $35 left, how much money, in dollars, did his brother have at first?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Michael had $42. Next, he gave away half of that money to his brother, which is $21. His brother then spent $3 on candy, leaving him with $35. To figure out how much money his brother had at first, we need to work backwards. If his brother had $35 after spending $3 on candy, then he had $38 before buying the candy. And if his brother received $21 from Michael, then he must have had $17 to begin with. Therefore, his brother had $17 at first. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Janet has 24 dresses.  Half of them have pockets.  Of those, a third have 2 pockets and the rest have 3 pockets.  How many total pockets do her dresses have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many dresses have pockets. We know that half of the dresses have pockets, so: 24 / 2 = 12 dresses have pockets Next, we need to find out how many of those 12 dresses have 2 pockets. We know that a third of the dresses with pockets have 2 pockets, so: 12 / 3 = 4 dresses have 2 pockets That means the remaining dresses with pockets (12 - 4 = 8) have 3 pockets each. Now we can calculate the total number of pockets: 4 dresses with 2 pockets = 4 x 2 = 8 pockets 8 dresses with 3 pockets = 8 x 3 = 24 pockets So the total number of pockets is: 8 + 24 = 32 pockets Therefore, Janet's dresses have a total of 32 pockets. The answer is 32.\n\n\nQ: There are 50 oysters on the rocks at La Push Park and 72 crabs by the beach. Eric, who loves walking by the beach, makes a note of this and goes home. The next day, he realizes only half the number of Oysters were on the rocks, and only 2/3 the number of crabs as the previous day are on the beach. How many oysters and crabs did he count in total in the two days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Eric counted 50 oysters and 72 crabs, so the total number of oysters and crabs he counted on the first day is: 50 + 72 = 122 On the second day, Eric realized only half the number of oysters were on the rocks, which means there were: 50 / 2 = 25 oysters on the rocks on the second day And only 2/3 the number of crabs as the previous day were on the beach, which means there were: 72 x 2/3 = 48 crabs on the beach on the second day So the total number of oysters and crabs Eric counted on the second day is: 25 + 48 = 73 Therefore, the total number of oysters and crabs Eric counted in total in the two days is: 122 + 73 = 195 The answer is 195.\n\n\nQ: Five people are planning a party. Sonja will buy a loaf of French bread ($3 a loaf) and a platter of cold cuts ($23). Barbara will buy the soda ($1 per person) and two boxes of crackers ($2 per box). Mario and Rick will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles ($3 per package). Danica will supply a package of paper plates for $4. How much more will Sonja spend than the rest of the office put together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of Barbara's contribution. She will buy soda for 5 people, which will cost $5 (1 dollar per person). She will also buy two boxes of crackers, which will cost $4 (2 dollars per box). Therefore, Barbara's total contribution will be $9. Next, let's calculate the total cost of Mario and Rick's contribution. They will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles, which will cost $6 in total (3 dollars per package). Now, let's add up the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's. Barbara's contribution is $9, Mario and Rick's contribution is $6, and Danica's contribution is $4. Therefore, the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's is $19. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of Sonja's contribution. She will buy a loaf of French bread for $3 and a platter of cold cuts for $23. Therefore, Sonja's total contribution will be $26. To find out how much more Sonja will spend than the rest of the office put together, we need to subtract the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's from Sonja's total contribution. $26 (Sonja's contribution) - $19 (total cost of everyone else's contribution) = $7 Therefore, Sonja will spend $7 more than the rest of the office put together. The answer is 7.\n\n\n"
