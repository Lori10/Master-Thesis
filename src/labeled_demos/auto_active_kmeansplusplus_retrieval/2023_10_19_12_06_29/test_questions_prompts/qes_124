  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Herman likes to feed the birds in December, January and February.  He feeds them 1/2 cup in the morning and 1/2 cup in the afternoon.  How many cups of food will he need for all three months?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days there are in December, January, and February. December has 31 days, January has 31 days, and February has 28 days (or 29 in a leap year). Next, we need to find out how many times Herman feeds the birds in a day. He feeds them 1/2 cup in the morning and 1/2 cup in the afternoon, so he feeds them a total of 1 cup per day. Now we can calculate how much food he needs for all three months. In one month, he feeds the birds for 31 days, so he needs 31 cups of food (1 cup per day). For all three months, he needs 31 cups x 3 months = 93 cups of food. The answer is 93.\n\n\nQ: Giselle had 20 female doves in a birdhouse. After a month, the doves laid 3 eggs each. If 3/4 of the eggs hatched, calculate the total number of doves Giselle has now.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many eggs were laid in total. Since each dove laid 3 eggs, we can multiply the number of doves by 3: 20 doves x 3 eggs/dove = 60 eggs Next, we need to find out how many of those eggs hatched. We know that 3/4 of the eggs hatched, so we can multiply the total number of eggs by 3/4: 60 eggs x 3/4 = 45 eggs hatched Finally, we need to add the number of original doves (20) to the number of hatched eggs (45) to find the total number of doves: 20 doves + 45 doves = 65 doves Therefore, Giselle now has 65 doves. The answer is 65.\n\n\nQ: Sandra eats 3 beignets every morning.  How many beignets will she eat in 16 weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many beignets Sandra eats in one week. To do this, we can multiply the number of beignets she eats in one day (3) by the number of days in a week (7): 3 beignets/day x 7 days/week = 21 beignets/week So Sandra eats 21 beignets in one week. Next, we need to find out how many beignets she will eat in 16 weeks. To do this, we can multiply the number of beignets she eats in one week (21) by the number of weeks (16): 21 beignets/week x 16 weeks = 336 beignets Therefore, Sandra will eat 336 beignets in 16 weeks. The answer is 16.\n\n\nQ: A snail kite is a kind of bird that eats apple snails. On the first day, a snail kite ate 3 snails. Then it eats 2 more snails than it did the day before. How many apple snails in all did a snail kite eat for 5 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, the snail kite ate 3 snails. On the second day, it ate 2 more snails than the day before, so it ate 3 + 2 = 5 snails. On the third day, it ate 2 more snails than the day before, so it ate 5 + 2 = 7 snails. On the fourth day, it ate 2 more snails than the day before, so it ate 7 + 2 = 9 snails. On the fifth day, it ate 2 more snails than the day before, so it ate 9 + 2 = 11 snails. To find the total number of snails the snail kite ate for 5 days, we add up the number of snails it ate each day: 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 35. Therefore, the snail kite ate 35 apple snails in all for 5 days. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Gilbert, the bearded dragon, eats 4 crickets per week when the temperature averages 90 degrees F per day, but he eats twice as many crickets per week when the temperature averages 100 degrees F.  How many crickets will he eat over 15 weeks if the temperature averages 90 degrees F for 80% of the time, and 100 degrees F for the remainder of the time?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many weeks Gilbert will be eating 4 crickets per week. Since the temperature averages 90 degrees F for 80% of the time, that means he will be eating 4 crickets per week for 80% of 15 weeks, which is 12 weeks. Next, we need to find out how many weeks Gilbert will be eating twice as many crickets per week. Since the temperature averages 100 degrees F for the remaining 20% of the time, that means he will be eating twice as many crickets per week for 20% of 15 weeks, which is 3 weeks. Now we can calculate how many crickets Gilbert will eat in total. For the 12 weeks he eats 4 crickets per week, he will eat a total of 4 x 12 = 48 crickets. For the 3 weeks he eats twice as many crickets per week, he will eat a total of 2 x 4 = 8 crickets per week, or 8 x 3 = 24 crickets in total. Adding these two totals together, Gilbert will eat a total of 48 + 24 = 72 crickets over 15 weeks. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: There are 50 oysters on the rocks at La Push Park and 72 crabs by the beach. Eric, who loves walking by the beach, makes a note of this and goes home. The next day, he realizes only half the number of Oysters were on the rocks, and only 2/3 the number of crabs as the previous day are on the beach. How many oysters and crabs did he count in total in the two days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Eric counted 50 oysters and 72 crabs, so the total number of oysters and crabs he counted on the first day is: 50 + 72 = 122 On the second day, Eric realized only half the number of oysters were on the rocks, which means there were: 50 / 2 = 25 oysters on the rocks on the second day And only 2/3 the number of crabs as the previous day were on the beach, which means there were: 72 x 2/3 = 48 crabs on the beach on the second day So the total number of oysters and crabs Eric counted on the second day is: 25 + 48 = 73 Therefore, the total number of oysters and crabs Eric counted in total in the two days is: 122 + 73 = 195 The answer is 195.\n\n\nQ: Farmer Brown raises emus, large birds. His flock has a total of 60 heads and legs. How many emus are in his flock?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine how many legs an emu has. Emus are birds, so they have two legs. Next, we need to determine how many legs are in the entire flock. If there are x emus in the flock, then there are 2x legs in total. We know that the total number of heads and legs is 60. So, we can set up an equation: 2x + x = 60 Simplifying: 3x = 60 x = 20 Therefore, there are 20 emus in Farmer Brown's flock. The answer is 20.\n\n\n"
