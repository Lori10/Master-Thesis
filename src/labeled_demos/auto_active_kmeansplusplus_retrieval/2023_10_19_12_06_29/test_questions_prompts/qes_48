  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Betsy is sewing a quilt.  The quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side.  Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together.  How many more squares does she need to sew together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many squares Betsy has already sewn together. If the quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side, then the total number of squares in the quilt is: 16 x 16 = 256 squares If Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together, then she has sewn: 0.25 x 256 = 64 squares Now we need to find out how many more squares she needs to sew together. To do this, we can subtract the number of squares she has already sewn from the total number of squares in the quilt: 256 - 64 = 192 squares So Betsy still needs to sew together 192 squares to complete the quilt. The answer is 192.\n\n\nQ: Janet has 24 dresses.  Half of them have pockets.  Of those, a third have 2 pockets and the rest have 3 pockets.  How many total pockets do her dresses have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many dresses have pockets. We know that half of the dresses have pockets, so: 24 / 2 = 12 dresses have pockets Next, we need to find out how many of those 12 dresses have 2 pockets. We know that a third of the dresses with pockets have 2 pockets, so: 12 / 3 = 4 dresses have 2 pockets That means the remaining dresses with pockets (12 - 4 = 8) have 3 pockets each. Now we can calculate the total number of pockets: 4 dresses with 2 pockets = 4 x 2 = 8 pockets 8 dresses with 3 pockets = 8 x 3 = 24 pockets So the total number of pockets is: 8 + 24 = 32 pockets Therefore, Janet's dresses have a total of 32 pockets. The answer is 32.\n\n\nQ: There are 50 marbles in a box which has a mixture of white, red and blue marbles. There were originally 20 white marbles and an equal number of red and blue marbles. Jack removes a number of marbles equal to double the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles. How many marbles are left in the box?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 20 white marbles and an equal number of red and blue marbles. So, we can say that there are 20 white, 15 red, and 15 blue marbles in the box. Next, we need to find the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles. In this case, the difference is 20 - 15 = 5. Then, we need to double that difference, which gives us 5 x 2 = 10. Jack removes 10 marbles from the box. So, the number of marbles left in the box is 50 - 10 = 40 marbles. The answer is 40.\n\n\nQ: Two-thirds of the class have brown eyes. Half of the students with brown eyes have black hair. If there are 6 students in the class with brown eyes and black hair, how many students are there in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that two-thirds of the class have brown eyes. Let's represent the total number of students in the class as \"x\". Then, we can write: (2/3)x = number of students with brown eyes Next, we know that half of the students with brown eyes have black hair. So, we can take half of the number of students with brown eyes to find the number of students with both brown eyes and black hair: (1/2)(2/3)x = 6 Simplifying this equation, we get: (1/3)x = 6 Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: x = 18 Therefore, there are 18 students in total. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: On a moonless night, three fireflies danced in the evening breeze.  They were joined by four less than a dozen more fireflies, before two of the fireflies flew away.  How many fireflies remained?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there were three fireflies dancing. Then, four less than a dozen (which is 12) more fireflies joined them. So, we can add 12-4=8 fireflies to the original three, making a total of 11 fireflies. Next, two of the fireflies flew away, so we need to subtract 2 from the 11 fireflies. Therefore, the final answer is 11-2=9 fireflies remained. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: James has a small tree outside his window with 30 branches with 90 twigs per branch. 30% of the twigs sprout 4 leaves and the rest sprout 5 leaves. How many leaves are on the tree total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of twigs on the tree. We know that there are 30 branches with 90 twigs per branch, so: 30 branches x 90 twigs per branch = 2700 twigs Next, we need to find how many twigs sprout 4 leaves and how many sprout 5 leaves. We know that 30% of the twigs sprout 4 leaves, so: 30% of 2700 twigs = 0.3 x 2700 = 810 twigs sprout 4 leaves The remaining twigs sprout 5 leaves: 2700 twigs - 810 twigs = 1890 twigs sprout 5 leaves Now we can find the total number of leaves on the tree. Each twig that sprouts 4 leaves contributes 4 leaves, and each twig that sprouts 5 leaves contributes 5 leaves. So: 810 twigs x 4 leaves per twig = 3240 leaves from twigs that sprout 4 leaves 1890 twigs x 5 leaves per twig = 9450 leaves from twigs that sprout 5 leaves The total number of leaves on the tree is: 3240 leaves + 9450 leaves = 12690 leaves Therefore, there are 12690 leaves on the tree in total. The answer is 12690.\n\n\n"
