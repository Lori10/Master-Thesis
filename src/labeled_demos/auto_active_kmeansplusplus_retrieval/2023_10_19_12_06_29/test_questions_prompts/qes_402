  "test_question": "Q: Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20. This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5 and the resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12. What was the final value of the number train?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A train leaves its departure station with 6 coal cars, 12 iron cars, and 2 wood cars. Between each station, there are 6 miles, and it takes 25 minutes to travel between them. At each station, the train can deposit up to 2 coal cars, 3 iron cars, and 1 wood car. How many minutes will it take to deliver all the cars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find the total number of cars the train has: 6 coal cars + 12 iron cars + 2 wood cars = 20 cars Next, let's find the maximum number of cars the train can deposit at each station: 2 coal cars + 3 iron cars + 1 wood car = 6 cars To deliver all 20 cars, the train will need to make multiple trips between stations. For each trip, the train can deposit 6 cars. So, the number of trips the train will need to make is: 20 cars \u00f7 6 cars per trip = 3.33 trips Since the train cannot make a partial trip, it will need to make 4 trips. Each trip takes 25 minutes, so the total time it will take to deliver all the cars is: 4 trips x 25 minutes per trip = 100 minutes The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Sally, Sam, and Steve went to play with their marbles. In the beginning, Sam has twice as many marbles as Steve while Sally has 5 less than Sam. After Sam has given Sally and Steve 3 marbles each, Sam has 8 marbles left. How many marbles does Steve have now?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Sam had in the beginning. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve, so let's call the number of marbles Steve had \"x\". This means that Sam had 2x marbles. Next, we know that Sally had 5 less marbles than Sam, so Sally had 2x - 5 marbles. After Sam gave 3 marbles each to Sally and Steve, he was left with 8 marbles. This means that he gave away a total of 6 marbles (3 to Sally and 3 to Steve), so he must have started with 14 marbles (8 + 6 = 14). Now we can use this information to figure out how many marbles Steve has. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve in the beginning, so if Sam had 14 marbles, Steve must have had 7 marbles (14 \u00f7 2 = 7). After Sam gave Steve 3 marbles, Steve now has 10 marbles (7 + 3 = 10). The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Hanna has twice as many erasers as Rachel.  Rachel has three less than one-half as many erasers as Tanya has red erasers.  If Tanya has 20 erasers, and half of them are red, how many erasers does Hanna have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red erasers Tanya has. We know that half of her erasers are red, so: 20/2 = 10 red erasers Next, we need to figure out how many erasers Rachel has. We know that Rachel has three less than one-half as many erasers as Tanya has red erasers, so: (1/2) * 20 - 3 = 7 erasers Finally, we need to find out how many erasers Hanna has, since we know she has twice as many as Rachel. Therefore: 2 * 7 = 14 erasers So, Hanna has 14 erasers. The answer is 14.\n\n\nQ: There are 50 marbles in a box which has a mixture of white, red and blue marbles. There were originally 20 white marbles and an equal number of red and blue marbles. Jack removes a number of marbles equal to double the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles. How many marbles are left in the box?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 20 white marbles and an equal number of red and blue marbles. So, we can say that there are 20 white, 15 red, and 15 blue marbles in the box. Next, we need to find the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles. In this case, the difference is 20 - 15 = 5. Then, we need to double that difference, which gives us 5 x 2 = 10. Jack removes 10 marbles from the box. So, the number of marbles left in the box is 50 - 10 = 40 marbles. The answer is 40.\n\n\nQ: Michael has $42. Michael gives away half the money to his brother. His brother then buys 3 dollars worth of candy. If his brother has $35 left, how much money, in dollars, did his brother have at first?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Michael had $42. Next, he gave away half of that money to his brother, which is $21. His brother then spent $3 on candy, leaving him with $35. To figure out how much money his brother had at first, we need to work backwards. If his brother had $35 after spending $3 on candy, then he had $38 before buying the candy. And if his brother received $21 from Michael, then he must have had $17 to begin with. Therefore, his brother had $17 at first. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Miriam currently has 30 marbles, but she used to have more. Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, gave her sister twice that amount and gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has. How many marbles did Miriam start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, so she now has 30 - 60 = -30 marbles. This doesn't make sense, so we know that Miriam must have started with more than 60 marbles. Next, we know that Miriam gave her sister twice the amount she gave her brother, so her sister received 2 * 60 = 120 marbles. We also know that Miriam gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has, so Savanna received 3 * 30 = 90 marbles. In total, Miriam gave away 60 + 120 + 90 = 270 marbles. If Miriam started with x marbles, we can set up the equation: x - 270 = 30 Solving for x, we get: x = 300 Therefore, Miriam started with 300 marbles. The answer is 300.\n\n\nQ: Seth bought some boxes of oranges. He gave a box to his mother. He then gave away half of the remaining boxes. If Seth has 4 boxes of oranges left, how many boxes did he buy in the first place?\nA: Let's think step by step. 1. Seth gave a box to his mother, so he had x-1 boxes left. 2. He then gave away half of the remaining boxes, which means he gave away (x-1)/2 boxes. 3. After giving away half of the remaining boxes, he had 4 boxes left. So, we can set up an equation: (x-1)/2 = x-4 4. Solving for x, we can simplify the equation: x-1 = 2(x-4) -> x-1 = 2x-8 -> x = 7 Therefore, Seth bought 7 boxes of oranges in the first place. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Grady has 20 red numbered cubes and 15 blue numbered cubes. He gives his friend Gage 2/5 of his red numbered cubes and 1/3 of the blue numbered cubes. If Gage had 10 red numbered cubes and 12 blue numbered cubes, find the total number of cubes Gage has?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red numbered cubes Grady gave to Gage. Grady gave 2/5 of his 20 red numbered cubes, which is: 2/5 x 20 = 8 red numbered cubes Next, we need to find out how many blue numbered cubes Grady gave to Gage. Grady gave 1/3 of his 15 blue numbered cubes, which is: 1/3 x 15 = 5 blue numbered cubes Now we know that Gage has 10 red numbered cubes and 12 blue numbered cubes, which means he received 8 red numbered cubes and 5 blue numbered cubes from Grady. To find the total number of cubes Gage has, we can add up all the cubes: 10 (red numbered cubes) + 12 (blue numbered cubes) + 8 (red numbered cubes from Grady) + 5 (blue numbered cubes from Grady) = 35 cubes Therefore, Gage has a total of 35 cubes. The answer is 35.\n\n\n"
