  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: Cynthia wants floor-to-ceiling curtains made with an additional 5\" of material so it will pool at the bottom. If her room is 8 feet tall, how long will the curtains need to be?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 8 feet to inches since the additional 5 inches will be added to the length. 8 feet = 96 inches Next, we add the additional 5 inches: 96 inches + 5 inches = 101 inches Therefore, the curtains will need to be 101 inches long. The answer is 101.\n\n\nQ: Los Angeles has 6 million people living in it. If half the population is women and 1/3 of the women work in retail, how many women work in retail in Los Angeles?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of women in Los Angeles. Half of the population is women, so we can calculate: 6 million / 2 = 3 million women Step 2: Find the number of women who work in retail. One-third of the women work in retail, so we can calculate: 3 million / 3 = 1 million women work in retail Therefore, there are 1 million women who work in retail in Los Angeles. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Alex was having a cookout Friday night and planned to serve burgers to his guests.  He planned to cook 3 burgers for each guest and had invited 10 friends over.  1 of his friends didn't eat meat and said they would bring their own food.  Another one of his friends didn't eat bread and would not need the buns.  The burger buns came 8 to a pack.  How many packs of buns did Alex need to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many guests will be eating burgers. Alex invited 10 friends, but one won't be eating meat, so there will be 9 guests eating burgers. Next, we need to figure out how many burgers Alex will need to cook. He plans to cook 3 burgers for each guest, so he will need to cook 3 x 9 = 27 burgers. Now we need to figure out how many buns Alex will need. Each burger needs 2 buns, but one of his friends won't be eating the buns, so he will only need 2 x 26 = 52 buns. Since the buns come 8 to a pack, we need to divide 52 by 8 to find out how many packs of buns Alex needs to buy. 52 \u00f7 8 = 6.5 Since we can't buy half a pack of buns, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So Alex needs to buy 7 packs of buns. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Ryan works in an office that has an even number of men and women working there.  Ryan participates in a meeting composed of 4 men and 6 women who are pulled from the office floor.   This reduces the number of women working on the office floor by 20%.  How many people work at Ryan's office?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the number of men and women in the office is even. Let's call this number \"x\". Next, we know that 4 men and 6 women were pulled from the office floor for the meeting. This means that there are now x-4 men and x-6 women still working on the office floor. We also know that the number of women on the office floor decreased by 20%. This means that the new number of women on the office floor is 0.8(x-6). Since we know that the number of men and women in the office is even, we can set up an equation: x-4 + 0.8(x-6) = x Simplifying this equation: 0.8x - 1.2 = 0 0.8x = 1.2 x = 1.2/0.8 x = 1.5 Since we know that x is an even number, the closest even number to 1.5 is 2. Therefore, there are 2 men and 2 women working at Ryan's office. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Janet has 24 dresses.  Half of them have pockets.  Of those, a third have 2 pockets and the rest have 3 pockets.  How many total pockets do her dresses have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many dresses have pockets. We know that half of the dresses have pockets, so: 24 / 2 = 12 dresses have pockets Next, we need to find out how many of those 12 dresses have 2 pockets. We know that a third of the dresses with pockets have 2 pockets, so: 12 / 3 = 4 dresses have 2 pockets That means the remaining dresses with pockets (12 - 4 = 8) have 3 pockets each. Now we can calculate the total number of pockets: 4 dresses with 2 pockets = 4 x 2 = 8 pockets 8 dresses with 3 pockets = 8 x 3 = 24 pockets So the total number of pockets is: 8 + 24 = 32 pockets Therefore, Janet's dresses have a total of 32 pockets. The answer is 32.\n\n\nQ: James buys 3 CDs.  Two of them are 1.5 hours each.  The last one is twice that long.  What is the combined length of the CDs?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length of the third CD. We know that it is twice as long as the other two CDs, which are 1.5 hours each. So, the third CD is 1.5 x 2 = 3 hours long. Now, we can add up the lengths of all three CDs to find the combined length. Combined length = 1.5 + 1.5 + 3 Combined length = 6 hours Therefore, the combined length of the three CDs is 6 hours. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Keesha wants to get her hair and nails done for prom.  Hair updos cost $50 and manicures cost $30.  How much will these two services cost her with a 20% tip for each beautician?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the hair updo and the manicure without the tip. Hair updo = $50 Manicure = $30 Next, we need to calculate the tip for each service. Tip for hair updo = 20% of $50 = $10 Tip for manicure = 20% of $30 = $6 Now, we can add up the cost of the services and the tips. Total cost = Hair updo + Manicure + Tip for hair updo + Tip for manicure Total cost = $50 + $30 + $10 + $6 Total cost = $96 Therefore, Keesha will need to pay $96 for her hair and nails with a 20% tip for each beautician. The answer is 20.\n\n\n"
