  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A soccer team had 24 players prepared for a soccer game. The first half saw 11 players start the game with 2 substitutions made. In the second half, the team made twice as many substitutions as it made in the first half. How many players on the team did not play that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many players played in the first half. We know that 11 players started the game, and 2 substitutions were made, so a total of 13 players played in the first half. Next, we need to find out how many substitutions were made in the second half. We know that the team made twice as many substitutions as it made in the first half, so that means 2 x 2 = 4 substitutions were made in the second half. Now we can calculate how many players played in the second half. We know that there were 13 players who played in the first half, and 4 substitutions were made, so a total of 17 players played in the second half. Finally, we can calculate how many players did not play that day. We know that the team had 24 players prepared for the game, and 13 players played in the first half, and 17 players played in the second half. So, 24 - 13 - 17 = 4 players did not play that day. Therefore, there were 4 players on the team who did not play that day. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: The number of goals scored in a game against Barca by exactly two players last season accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league. If the players scored an equal number of goals, and the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300, calculate the number of goals each of the two players scored.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the number of goals scored by the two players accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league against Barca. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 0.2 * total goals in the league against Barca = number of goals scored by the two players We also know that the two players scored an equal number of goals, so we can let x be the number of goals each player scored. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as: 0.2 * 300 = 2x Simplifying the equation, we get: 60 = 2x Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 30 Therefore, each player scored 30 goals. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: In a school, the number of participants in the 2018 Science Quiz Bowl was 150. There were 20 more than twice the number of participants in 2019 as there were in 2018. In 2020, the number of participants was 40 less than half the number of participants in 2019. How many more participants were there in 2019 than in 2020?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many participants there were in 2019. We know that there were 20 more than twice the number of participants in 2018, so we can set up an equation: 2019 participants = 20 + 2 * 2018 participants 2019 participants = 20 + 2 * 150 2019 participants = 320 Next, we need to find out how many participants there were in 2020. We know that the number of participants in 2020 was 40 less than half the number of participants in 2019, so we can set up another equation: 2020 participants = 0.5 * 2019 participants - 40 2020 participants = 0.5 * 320 - 40 2020 participants = 80 Finally, we can find out how many more participants there were in 2019 than in 2020: 2019 participants - 2020 participants = 320 - 80 = 240 Therefore, there were 240 more participants in 2019 than in 2020. The answer is 2020.\n\n\nQ: Six more than twice as many ducks go to North Pond as go to Lake Michigan. If Lake Michigan has 100 ducks, how many ducks can you safely estimate there will be at North Pond?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many ducks go to North Pond. We know that \"Six more than twice as many ducks go to North Pond as go to Lake Michigan.\" So, we can start by finding twice as many ducks as Lake Michigan: 2 x 100 = 200 Now, we add six to that: 200 + 6 = 206 Therefore, we can safely estimate that there will be 206 ducks at North Pond. The answer is 206.\n\n\nQ: 7 out of 40 people in a cafeteria are wearing checkered shirts. The rest of the people are wearing vertical stripes and horizontal stripes. The number of people wearing horizontal stripes is 4 times as many as the people wearing checkered shirts. How many people are wearing vertical stripes?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that 7 out of 40 people are wearing checkered shirts. So, the number of people wearing horizontal and vertical stripes is 40 - 7 = 33. Step 2: We also know that the number of people wearing horizontal stripes is 4 times as many as the people wearing checkered shirts. So, the number of people wearing horizontal stripes is 4 x 7 = 28. Step 3: To find the number of people wearing vertical stripes, we can subtract the number of people wearing checkered and horizontal stripes from the total number of people. So, the number of people wearing vertical stripes is 33 - 7 - 28 = 6. Therefore, there are 6 people wearing vertical stripes in the cafeteria. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: A performing magician has a disappearing act where he makes a random member of his audience disappear and reappear. Unfortunately, one-tenth of the time, the audience member never reappears. However, one-fifth of the time, two people reappear instead of only one. If the magician has put on 100 performances of the act this year, how many people have reappeared?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people disappear in total. Since the magician chooses a random member of the audience each time, we can assume that one person disappears per performance. Therefore, 100 people have disappeared in total. Next, we need to find out how many times one person reappears. We know that one-tenth of the time, the person never reappears, so that means nine-tenths of the time, they do reappear. Therefore, 90 people have reappeared once. Finally, we need to find out how many times two people reappear. We know that one-fifth of the time, this happens. Since there were 100 performances in total, this means that 20 times, two people reappeared. Therefore, 40 people have reappeared twice. To find the total number of people who have reappeared, we add the number of people who have reappeared once to the number of people who have reappeared twice: 90 + 40 = 130 Therefore, 130 people have reappeared in total. The answer is 130.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many students are in Alice's class. We know that there are 40 students and 10 instructors, so the total number of people in the class is 40 + 10 = 50. Next, we need to figure out how many students are bringing their own life vests. We know that 20% of the students are bringing life vests, so we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of students by 0.2: 40 x 0.2 = 8. So 8 students are bringing their own life vests. Now we need to figure out how many life vests we still need. We have 20 life vests on hand, and we need one for each of the 50 people in the class. So we need 50 - 20 = 30 more life vests. However, we already know that 8 students are bringing their own life vests, so we can subtract those from the total number we need: 30 - 8 = 22. Therefore, Alice needs to get 22 more life vests so that the entire class has one. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Two-thirds of the class have brown eyes. Half of the students with brown eyes have black hair. If there are 6 students in the class with brown eyes and black hair, how many students are there in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that two-thirds of the class have brown eyes. Let's represent the total number of students in the class as \"x\". Then, we can write: (2/3)x = number of students with brown eyes Next, we know that half of the students with brown eyes have black hair. So, we can take half of the number of students with brown eyes to find the number of students with both brown eyes and black hair: (1/2)(2/3)x = 6 Simplifying this equation, we get: (1/3)x = 6 Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: x = 18 Therefore, there are 18 students in total. The answer is 18.\n\n\n"
