  "test_question": "Q: John makes himself a 6 egg omelet with 2 oz of cheese and an equal amount of ham.  Eggs are 75 calories each.  Cheese is 120 calories per ounce.  Ham is 40 calories per ounce.  How many calories is the omelet?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: James takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces.  He splits the pieces between 4 people.  If an orange has 80 calories how many calories does each person get?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pieces James has in total. He takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces, so he has 5 x 8 = 40 pieces in total. Next, we need to divide the pieces between 4 people. To do this, we can divide the total number of pieces by 4: 40 \u00f7 4 = 10 pieces per person. Finally, we need to find out how many calories each person gets. We know that one orange has 80 calories, so each piece has 80 \u00f7 8 = 10 calories. Therefore, each person gets 10 x 10 = 100 calories. So each person gets 100 calories. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Brandon can catch 6 squirrels or two rabbits in 1 hour. Each squirrel has 300 calories and each rabbit has 800 calories. How many more calories will he get per hour if he catches squirrels instead of rabbits?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many calories Brandon can get from catching squirrels in one hour. We know that each squirrel has 300 calories, and he can catch 6 squirrels in one hour. So, the total number of calories he can get from catching squirrels in one hour is: 300 calories/squirrel x 6 squirrels = 1800 calories Next, we need to find out how many calories Brandon can get from catching rabbits in one hour. We know that each rabbit has 800 calories, and he can catch 2 rabbits in one hour. So, the total number of calories he can get from catching rabbits in one hour is: 800 calories/rabbit x 2 rabbits = 1600 calories Finally, we need to find out how many more calories Brandon will get per hour if he catches squirrels instead of rabbits. We can do this by subtracting the number of calories he can get from catching rabbits from the number of calories he can get from catching squirrels: 1800 calories - 1600 calories = 200 calories Therefore, Brandon will get 200 more calories per hour if he catches squirrels instead of rabbits. The answer is 200.\n\n\nQ: Phoebe has two pizzas to share with her and three friends. One has pepperoni and the other has cheese. They both have 16 slices. They all eat the same amount. One friend eats only pepperoni, while the rest have an equal number of slices of each. At the end, there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese, how many slices does each person eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 2 pizzas with 16 slices each, so there are a total of 32 slices. Next, we know that one friend only eats pepperoni, so they eat one slice from the pepperoni pizza. That leaves 31 slices, with 15 slices from each pizza. We also know that there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese left. So, the remaining 15 slices are divided equally among the remaining 3 friends, which means each of them eats 5 slices. Therefore, each person eats 1 slice of pepperoni and 5 slices of cheese. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: John drinks 2 energy drinks. 1 of them is a 12-ounce drink with 250 grams of caffeine.  The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce but only 2 ounces.  He then takes a caffeine pill that has as much caffeine as his 2 drinks combined.  How much caffeine did he consume?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much caffeine is in the 12-ounce energy drink. We know that it has 250 grams of caffeine, so we can convert that to ounces by dividing by 28.35 (the number of grams in an ounce): 250 / 28.35 = 8.82 ounces of caffeine in the 12-ounce drink Next, we need to find out how much caffeine is in the second energy drink. We know that it is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce than the first drink, so we can multiply the caffeine per ounce in the first drink (8.82 / 12 = 0.735 ounces per ounce) by 3: 0.735 * 3 = 2.205 ounces per ounce in the second drink Since the second drink is only 2 ounces, we can multiply the caffeine per ounce by 2 to find out how much caffeine is in the second drink: 2.205 * 2 = 4.41 ounces of caffeine in the second drink Now we can add up the caffeine in both drinks: 8.82 + 4.41 = 13.23 ounces of caffeine in both drinks Finally, we need to add the caffeine in the caffeine pill. We know that the pill has as much caffeine as both drinks combined, so we can add 13.23 ounces to itself: 13.23 + 13.23 = 26.46 ounces of caffeine in total Therefore, John consumed 26.46 ounces of caffeine in total. The answer is 26.\n\n\nQ: John takes a pill every 6 hours.  How many pills does he take a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 24 hours in a day, so John takes 24/6 = 4 pills per day. In a week, there are 7 days, so John takes 4 x 7 = 28 pills per week. The answer is 28.\n\n\nQ: There are 50 oysters on the rocks at La Push Park and 72 crabs by the beach. Eric, who loves walking by the beach, makes a note of this and goes home. The next day, he realizes only half the number of Oysters were on the rocks, and only 2/3 the number of crabs as the previous day are on the beach. How many oysters and crabs did he count in total in the two days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Eric counted 50 oysters and 72 crabs, so the total number of oysters and crabs he counted on the first day is: 50 + 72 = 122 On the second day, Eric realized only half the number of oysters were on the rocks, which means there were: 50 / 2 = 25 oysters on the rocks on the second day And only 2/3 the number of crabs as the previous day were on the beach, which means there were: 72 x 2/3 = 48 crabs on the beach on the second day So the total number of oysters and crabs Eric counted on the second day is: 25 + 48 = 73 Therefore, the total number of oysters and crabs Eric counted in total in the two days is: 122 + 73 = 195 The answer is 195.\n\n\nQ: Giselle had 20 female doves in a birdhouse. After a month, the doves laid 3 eggs each. If 3/4 of the eggs hatched, calculate the total number of doves Giselle has now.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many eggs were laid in total. Since each dove laid 3 eggs, we can multiply the number of doves by 3: 20 doves x 3 eggs/dove = 60 eggs Next, we need to find out how many of those eggs hatched. We know that 3/4 of the eggs hatched, so we can multiply the total number of eggs by 3/4: 60 eggs x 3/4 = 45 eggs hatched Finally, we need to add the number of original doves (20) to the number of hatched eggs (45) to find the total number of doves: 20 doves + 45 doves = 65 doves Therefore, Giselle now has 65 doves. The answer is 65.\n\n\nQ: Last night Kannon had 3 apples, a banana, and 4 oranges for dinner. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, and twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today. How many fruits would she have eaten so far in the two meals?\nA: Let's think step by step. Last night Kannon had 3 apples, 1 banana, and 4 oranges, so she had a total of 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 fruits. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, which means she will have 3 + 4 = 7 apples today. She is also planning to have 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, which means she will have 1 x 10 = 10 bananas today. Finally, she is planning to have twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today, which means she will have 7 x 2 = 14 oranges today. Therefore, in total, Kannon will have eaten 7 + 10 + 14 = 31 fruits in the two meals. The answer is 31.\n\n\n"
