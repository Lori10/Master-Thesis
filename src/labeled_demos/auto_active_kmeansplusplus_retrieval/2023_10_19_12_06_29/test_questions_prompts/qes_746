  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Blanche, Rose and Dorothy liked to collect sea glass when they went to the beach.  Blanche found 12 pieces of green and 3 pieces of red sea glass.  Rose found 9 pieces of red and 11 pieces of blue sea glass.  If Dorothy found twice as many pieces of red glass as Blanche and Rose and three times as much blue sea glass as Rose, how many pieces did Dorothy have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many pieces of red sea glass Blanche and Rose found combined. Blanche found 3 pieces of red sea glass and Rose found 9 pieces of red sea glass, so together they found 3 + 9 = 12 pieces of red sea glass. Next, let's find out how many pieces of blue sea glass Rose found. Rose found 11 pieces of blue sea glass. Now, let's use the information given to find out how many pieces of red and blue sea glass Dorothy found. We know that Dorothy found twice as many pieces of red sea glass as Blanche and Rose combined, which is 2 * 12 = 24 pieces of red sea glass. We also know that Dorothy found three times as much blue sea glass as Rose, which is 3 * 11 = 33 pieces of blue sea glass. Finally, we can add up all the pieces of sea glass that Dorothy found: 24 pieces of red sea glass + 33 pieces of blue sea glass = 57 pieces of sea glass in total. Therefore, Dorothy found 57 pieces of sea glass. The answer is 57.\n\n\nQ: Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. If Mabel has 85 marbles, how many more marbles does Mabel have than Amanda?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Katrina has. We know that Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 85 marbles, so we can set up an equation: Mabel's marbles = 5 x Katrina's marbles 85 = 5 x Katrina's marbles Katrina's marbles = 17 Now we know that Katrina has 17 marbles. We also know that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. So we can set up another equation: Amanda's marbles = 2 x Katrina's marbles + 12 Amanda's marbles = 2 x 17 + 12 Amanda's marbles = 46 So Amanda has 46 marbles. Finally, we can figure out how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda: Mabel's marbles - Amanda's marbles = 85 - 46 Mabel's marbles - Amanda's marbles = 39 Therefore, Mabel has 39 more marbles than Amanda. The answer is 39.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Don can paint 3 tiles a minute, Ken can paint 2 more tiles a minute than Don and Laura can paint twice as many tiles as Ken. Kim can paint 3 fewer tiles than Laura can in a minute. How many tiles can Don, Ken, Laura and Kim paint in 15 minutes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many tiles each person can paint in one minute. Don can paint 3 tiles a minute. Ken can paint 2 more tiles a minute than Don, so Ken can paint 3 + 2 = 5 tiles a minute. Laura can paint twice as many tiles as Ken, so Laura can paint 5 x 2 = 10 tiles a minute. Kim can paint 3 fewer tiles than Laura can in a minute, so Kim can paint 10 - 3 = 7 tiles a minute. Now that we know how many tiles each person can paint in one minute, we can multiply that by 15 to find out how many tiles they can paint in 15 minutes. Don can paint 3 x 15 = 45 tiles in 15 minutes. Ken can paint 5 x 15 = 75 tiles in 15 minutes. Laura can paint 10 x 15 = 150 tiles in 15 minutes. Kim can paint 7 x 15 = 105 tiles in 15 minutes. Therefore, Don can paint 45 tiles, Ken can paint 75 tiles, Laura can paint 150 tiles, and Kim can paint 105 tiles in 15 minutes. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Jerry is sweeping up pieces of broken glass in the parking lot. He sweeps up 20 amber pieces, 35 green pieces, and some clear pieces. If the green pieces are 25% of the total glass he sweeps up, how many pieces were clear?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the green pieces are 25% of the total glass, so we can set up an equation: 35 = 0.25x where x is the total number of pieces of glass Jerry sweeps up. We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.25: x = 140 So Jerry sweeps up a total of 140 pieces of glass. We also know that he sweeps up 20 amber pieces and 35 green pieces, so the number of clear pieces must be: 140 - 20 - 35 = 85 Therefore, Jerry swept up 85 clear pieces of glass. The answer is 85.\n\n\nQ: Hanna has twice as many erasers as Rachel.  Rachel has three less than one-half as many erasers as Tanya has red erasers.  If Tanya has 20 erasers, and half of them are red, how many erasers does Hanna have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red erasers Tanya has. We know that half of her erasers are red, so: 20/2 = 10 red erasers Next, we need to figure out how many erasers Rachel has. We know that Rachel has three less than one-half as many erasers as Tanya has red erasers, so: (1/2) * 20 - 3 = 7 erasers Finally, we need to find out how many erasers Hanna has, since we know she has twice as many as Rachel. Therefore: 2 * 7 = 14 erasers So, Hanna has 14 erasers. The answer is 14.\n\n\nQ: Cleo and Ignacio placed 30 of their marbles in a jar on a Monday. They took 3/5 of the marbles from the jar the next day and divided them equally. On the third day, Cleo took 1/2 of the marbles remaining in the jars. How many marbles did Cleo have on the third day?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many marbles were taken from the jar on the second day. 3/5 of 30 marbles = (3/5) x 30 = 18 marbles So, 18 marbles were taken from the jar on the second day. Step 2: Find out how many marbles were left in the jar after the second day. 30 - 18 = 12 marbles So, 12 marbles were left in the jar after the second day. Step 3: Find out how many marbles Cleo took on the third day. 1/2 of 12 marbles = (1/2) x 12 = 6 marbles So, Cleo took 6 marbles on the third day. Step 4: Find out how many marbles Cleo had on the third day. Cleo had 6 marbles on the third day. Therefore, Cleo had 6 marbles on the third day. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Nori had 4 boxes of crayons with 8 crayons in each box. She gave 5 crayons to Mae and also give some crayons to Lea. How many more crayons did she give to Lea than Mae if she has only 15 crayons left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many crayons Nori had in total. 4 boxes x 8 crayons per box = 32 crayons Next, we need to subtract the 5 crayons Nori gave to Mae. 32 crayons - 5 crayons = 27 crayons We know that Nori has 15 crayons left, so we can subtract that from the 27 crayons to find out how many crayons she gave to Lea. 27 crayons - 15 crayons = 12 crayons Therefore, Nori gave 12 crayons to Lea. To find out how many more crayons Nori gave to Lea than Mae, we can subtract the 5 crayons from Mae from the 12 crayons given to Lea. 12 crayons - 5 crayons = 7 crayons So Nori gave 7 more crayons to Lea than Mae. The answer is 7.\n\n\n"
