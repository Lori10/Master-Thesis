  "formatted_prompt": "Q: At the zoo, there are 5 different types of animals. Seeing each animal type takes around 6 minutes. How much time would it take to see each animal type if the zoo decided to import 4 new species?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many animal types there will be in total after the zoo imports 4 new species. 5 (original animal types) + 4 (new species) = 9 (total animal types) Next, we need to find out how long it takes to see each animal type. 6 minutes per animal type x 9 animal types = 54 minutes Therefore, it would take 54 minutes to see each animal type if the zoo decided to import 4 new species. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: A factory uses robots to manufacture batteries. For each battery that is made, it takes a robot 6 minutes to gather the materials for the battery and 9 minutes to create the battery. If the factory has 10 robots working on batteries at the same time, how many batteries can the robots manufacture in 5 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 5 hours to minutes. 5 hours = 5 x 60 = 300 minutes Next, we need to find out how long it takes for one robot to make one battery. 6 minutes to gather materials + 9 minutes to create battery = 15 minutes per battery Now we can calculate how many batteries one robot can make in 300 minutes. 300 minutes \u00f7 15 minutes per battery = 20 batteries Finally, we can multiply the number of batteries one robot can make by the number of robots working. 20 batteries per robot x 10 robots = 200 batteries Therefore, the robots can manufacture 200 batteries in 5 hours. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: There are 50 oysters on the rocks at La Push Park and 72 crabs by the beach. Eric, who loves walking by the beach, makes a note of this and goes home. The next day, he realizes only half the number of Oysters were on the rocks, and only 2/3 the number of crabs as the previous day are on the beach. How many oysters and crabs did he count in total in the two days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Eric counted 50 oysters and 72 crabs, so the total number of oysters and crabs he counted on the first day is: 50 + 72 = 122 On the second day, Eric realized only half the number of oysters were on the rocks, which means there were: 50 / 2 = 25 oysters on the rocks on the second day And only 2/3 the number of crabs as the previous day were on the beach, which means there were: 72 x 2/3 = 48 crabs on the beach on the second day So the total number of oysters and crabs Eric counted on the second day is: 25 + 48 = 73 Therefore, the total number of oysters and crabs Eric counted in total in the two days is: 122 + 73 = 195 The answer is 195.\n\n\nQ: A snail kite is a kind of bird that eats apple snails. On the first day, a snail kite ate 3 snails. Then it eats 2 more snails than it did the day before. How many apple snails in all did a snail kite eat for 5 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, the snail kite ate 3 snails. On the second day, it ate 2 more snails than the day before, so it ate 3 + 2 = 5 snails. On the third day, it ate 2 more snails than the day before, so it ate 5 + 2 = 7 snails. On the fourth day, it ate 2 more snails than the day before, so it ate 7 + 2 = 9 snails. On the fifth day, it ate 2 more snails than the day before, so it ate 9 + 2 = 11 snails. To find the total number of snails the snail kite ate for 5 days, we add up the number of snails it ate each day: 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 35. Therefore, the snail kite ate 35 apple snails in all for 5 days. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: James writes a comic every other day for 4 years. If there was no leap year, how many comics has he written?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days there are in 4 years. Since there are 365 days in a year, we can multiply 365 by 4 to get: 365 x 4 = 1460 days Next, we need to figure out how many comics James writes in every other day. Since he writes a comic every other day, we can divide the total number of days by 2 to get: 1460 / 2 = 730 comics Therefore, James has written 730 comics in 4 years if there was no leap year. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: The white rabbit can hop 15 meters in one minute. The brown rabbit hops 12 meters per minute. What is the total distance the two rabbits will hop in 5 minutes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how far the white rabbit can hop in 5 minutes. To do this, we can multiply its speed by the time: 15 meters/minute x 5 minutes = 75 meters So the white rabbit can hop 75 meters in 5 minutes. Next, we need to find out how far the brown rabbit can hop in 5 minutes. Again, we can multiply its speed by the time: 12 meters/minute x 5 minutes = 60 meters So the brown rabbit can hop 60 meters in 5 minutes. To find the total distance the two rabbits will hop in 5 minutes, we simply add their distances: 75 meters + 60 meters = 135 meters Therefore, the two rabbits will hop a total distance of 135 meters in 5 minutes. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Betty and Dora started making some cupcakes at the same time. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour and Dora makes 8 every hour. If Betty took a two-hour break, what is the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Betty made in the first 3 hours before taking a break. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour, so in 3 hours, she would make: 10 cupcakes/hour x 3 hours = 30 cupcakes Next, we need to find out how many cupcakes Dora made in the same 5 hours. Dora makes 8 cupcakes every hour, so in 5 hours, she would make: 8 cupcakes/hour x 5 hours = 40 cupcakes Now we need to find the difference between the number of cupcakes they made. Betty made 30 cupcakes before taking a break, and Dora made 40 cupcakes in the same 5 hours. So the difference between the number of cupcakes they made is: 40 cupcakes - 30 cupcakes = 10 cupcakes Therefore, the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours is 10 cupcakes. The answer is 10.\n\n\n"
