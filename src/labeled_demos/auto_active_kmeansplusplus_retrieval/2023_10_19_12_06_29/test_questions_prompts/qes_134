  "formatted_prompt": "Q: John buys 500 newspapers.  Each newspaper sells for $2.  He sells 80% of them.  He buys them all for 75% less than the price at which he sells them.  How much profit does he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much John buys the newspapers for. He buys them for 75% less than the price at which he sells them, which means he buys them for 25% of the selling price. 25% of the selling price = 0.25 x 2 = $0.50 So, John buys each newspaper for $0.50. Next, let's calculate how much John earns from selling the newspapers. He sells 80% of the 500 newspapers, which is: 0.8 x 500 = 400 newspapers He sells each newspaper for $2, so his total earnings are: 400 x 2 = $800 Now, let's calculate how much John spent on buying the newspapers: 500 x 0.50 = $250 Therefore, John's profit is: $800 - $250 = $550 So, John makes a profit of $550. The answer is 550.\n\n\nQ: Grant spends $200.00 a year to have the newspaper delivered daily to his house.  Juanita buys the newspaper daily.  Monday through Saturday, she spends $0.50 and on Sunday she spends $2.00.  How much more money does Juanita spend buying the newspaper yearly than Grant?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper daily from Monday to Saturday: $0.50 x 6 = $3.00 Now, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper on Sundays: $2.00 x 1 = $2.00 Next, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper weekly: $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00 Finally, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper yearly: $5.00 x 52 = $260.00 Now, let's calculate the difference between what Juanita spends and what Grant spends: $260.00 - $200.00 = $60.00 Therefore, Juanita spends $60.00 more buying the newspaper yearly than Grant. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: James writes a comic every other day for 4 years. If there was no leap year, how many comics has he written?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days there are in 4 years. Since there are 365 days in a year, we can multiply 365 by 4 to get: 365 x 4 = 1460 days Next, we need to figure out how many comics James writes in every other day. Since he writes a comic every other day, we can divide the total number of days by 2 to get: 1460 / 2 = 730 comics Therefore, James has written 730 comics in 4 years if there was no leap year. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour. Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour.  Oliver can read 40 pages.  How many pages can Carter read in 1 hour?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Oliver can read 40 pages in 1 hour. Next, we know that Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour, so Lucy can read 40 + 20 = 60 pages in 1 hour. Finally, we know that Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour, so Carter can read 60 / 2 = 30 pages in 1 hour. Therefore, Carter can read 30 pages in 1 hour. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Carl has a goal of selling 96 cupcakes in 2 days. Carl needs to give 24 cupcakes to Bonnie as payment for using her storefront. How many cupcakes must Carl sell per day to reach his goal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to subtract the 24 cupcakes that Carl needs to give to Bonnie from his goal of selling 96 cupcakes. 96 - 24 = 72 So Carl needs to sell 72 cupcakes in 2 days. To find out how many cupcakes he needs to sell per day, we can divide 72 by 2: 72 \u00f7 2 = 36 Therefore, Carl needs to sell 36 cupcakes per day to reach his goal of selling 96 cupcakes in 2 days, after giving 24 cupcakes to Bonnie. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: Enrique has 2 132 contracts that he needs to shred.  His paper shredder will only allow him to shred 6 pages at a time.  How many times will he shred 6 units of paper until all of the contracts are shredded?\nA: Let's think step by step. Enrique has 2 contracts, each with 132 pages. So, he has a total of 2 x 132 = 264 pages to shred. Enrique can shred 6 pages at a time. To find out how many times he needs to shred 6 pages to shred all 264 pages, we can divide 264 by 6: 264 \u00f7 6 = 44 So, Enrique will need to shred 6 pages 44 times to shred all 264 pages. The answer is 264.\n\n\nQ: On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much milk one cow produces in a week. We can do this by dividing the total amount of milk produced in 5 weeks (2160 liters) by the number of weeks (5) and the number of cows (x): 2160 = 6x * 108 * 5 2160 = 540x x = 4 Therefore, there are 4 cows on the farm. The answer is 4.\n\n\n"
