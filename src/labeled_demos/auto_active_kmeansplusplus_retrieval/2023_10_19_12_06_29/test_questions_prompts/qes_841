  "formatted_prompt": "Q: John buys game loot boxes for $5 each.  The average value of items inside is $3.5.   He spends $40 on loot boxes.  What is the average amount he lost?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many loot boxes John bought. We can do this by dividing the total amount he spent by the cost of each loot box: 40 / 5 = 8 So John bought 8 loot boxes. Next, we need to find out the total value of the items inside all the loot boxes. We can do this by multiplying the average value of each box by the number of boxes: 3.5 x 8 = 28 So the total value of the items inside all the loot boxes is $28. Finally, we can find out the average amount John lost by subtracting the total value of the items from the total amount he spent: 40 - 28 = 12 So John lost an average of $12 on each loot box. The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: James buys $3000 worth of stuff from Amazon.  He has to return a TV that cost $700 and a bike that cost $500.  He also sells another bike that cost 20% more than the bike he returned for 80% of what he bought it for.  He then buys a toaster for $100.  How much is he out of pocket for everything?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, James spent $3000 on Amazon. Then he returned a TV that cost $700 and a bike that cost $500. So, he spent $3000 - $700 - $500 = $1800. Next, he sold a bike that cost 20% more than the bike he returned. If the returned bike cost $500, then the bike he sold cost 1.2 * $500 = $600. He sold it for 80% of what he bought it for, which is 0.8 * $600 = $480. Now, let's add up all the transactions. James spent $1800 on Amazon, sold a bike for $480, and bought a toaster for $100. So, he is out of pocket for $1800 - $480 + $100 = $1420. Therefore, James is out of pocket for $1420. The answer is 1420.\n\n\nQ: John buys 500 newspapers.  Each newspaper sells for $2.  He sells 80% of them.  He buys them all for 75% less than the price at which he sells them.  How much profit does he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much John buys the newspapers for. He buys them for 75% less than the price at which he sells them, which means he buys them for 25% of the selling price. 25% of the selling price = 0.25 x 2 = $0.50 So, John buys each newspaper for $0.50. Next, let's calculate how much John earns from selling the newspapers. He sells 80% of the 500 newspapers, which is: 0.8 x 500 = 400 newspapers He sells each newspaper for $2, so his total earnings are: 400 x 2 = $800 Now, let's calculate how much John spent on buying the newspapers: 500 x 0.50 = $250 Therefore, John's profit is: $800 - $250 = $550 So, John makes a profit of $550. The answer is 550.\n\n\nQ: Jim buys a wedding ring for $10,000.  He gets his wife a ring that is twice that much and sells the first one for half its value.  How much is he out of pocket?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Jim buys a wedding ring for $10,000. Next, we know that he gets his wife a ring that is twice that much, which means he spends $20,000 on her ring. Now, he sells the first ring for half its value, which means he sells it for $5,000. To find out how much Jim is out of pocket, we need to add up all of his expenses and subtract any income he received from selling the first ring. So, Jim's total expenses are $10,000 + $20,000 = $30,000. His income from selling the first ring is $5,000. Therefore, Jim is out of pocket $30,000 - $5,000 = $25,000. The answer is 25000.\n\n\nQ: Michael has $42. Michael gives away half the money to his brother. His brother then buys 3 dollars worth of candy. If his brother has $35 left, how much money, in dollars, did his brother have at first?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Michael had $42. Next, he gave away half of that money to his brother, which is $21. His brother then spent $3 on candy, leaving him with $35. To figure out how much money his brother had at first, we need to work backwards. If his brother had $35 after spending $3 on candy, then he had $38 before buying the candy. And if his brother received $21 from Michael, then he must have had $17 to begin with. Therefore, his brother had $17 at first. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: A factory decides to stop making cars and start making motorcycles instead. When it made cars, per month, it cost $100 for materials, they could make 4 cars, and they sold each car for $50. Now that they make motorcycles it costs $250 for materials, but they sell 8 of them for $50 each. How much more profit do they make per month selling motorcycles instead of cars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the profit made per car: Revenue per car = $50 Cost per car = $100/4 = $25 Profit per car = Revenue per car - Cost per car = $50 - $25 = $25 Now, let's calculate the profit made per motorcycle: Revenue per motorcycle = $50 x 8 = $400 Cost per motorcycle = $250 Profit per motorcycle = Revenue per motorcycle - Cost per motorcycle = $400 - $250 = $150 Finally, let's calculate the difference in profit between making cars and making motorcycles: Profit difference = Profit per motorcycle - Profit per car = $150 - $25 = $125 Therefore, the factory makes $125 more profit per month by making motorcycles instead of cars. The answer is 125.\n\n\nQ: John is performing in 3 plays.  Each play has 5 Acts.  He wears 2 wigs per act.  Each wig cost $5.  He drops one of the plays and sells all of the wigs for that play for $4.  How much money did he spend?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many wigs John needs in total. Since he performs in 3 plays and each play has 5 acts, he needs 3 x 5 = 15 wigs in total. Next, we need to find out how much he spent on all the wigs. Since he wears 2 wigs per act, he needs 2 x 15 = 30 wigs in total. Each wig costs $5, so he spent 30 x $5 = $150 on all the wigs. Now, we need to find out how much money he made by selling the wigs from one of the plays. He sold all the wigs for $4 each, so he made 15 x $4 = $60. Finally, we need to subtract the money he made from the money he spent to find out how much money he spent in total. $150 - $60 = $90. Therefore, John spent $90 on all the wigs. The answer is 90.\n\n\nQ: Adam has just bought some new books so he has decided to clean up his bookcase. After he adds his new books to his bookshelf he realizes that he has bought enough books to finish completely filling his bookcase with 2 books left over. Before his shopping trip, Adam had 56 books in his bookcase. If his bookcase has 4 shelves and averages 20 books per shelf, how many books did Adam buy on his shopping trip?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many books can fit on Adam's bookcase. We know that he has 4 shelves and each shelf can hold an average of 20 books, so the total capacity of his bookcase is: 4 shelves x 20 books per shelf = 80 books Next, we need to figure out how many books Adam had before his shopping trip. We know that he had 56 books in his bookcase before he bought any new books. Now, we can use the information given in the problem to figure out how many books Adam bought on his shopping trip. We know that he bought enough books to completely fill his bookcase with 2 books left over. This means that he bought: 80 books - 2 books left over = 78 books Therefore, Adam bought 78 books on his shopping trip. The answer is 78.\n\n\n"
