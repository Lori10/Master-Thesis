  "test_question": "Q: John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.  He also buys twice as many bottles of cognac that cost 50% more per bottle.  How much does he spend on everything?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Five people are planning a party. Sonja will buy a loaf of French bread ($3 a loaf) and a platter of cold cuts ($23). Barbara will buy the soda ($1 per person) and two boxes of crackers ($2 per box). Mario and Rick will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles ($3 per package). Danica will supply a package of paper plates for $4. How much more will Sonja spend than the rest of the office put together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of Barbara's contribution. She will buy soda for 5 people, which will cost $5 (1 dollar per person). She will also buy two boxes of crackers, which will cost $4 (2 dollars per box). Therefore, Barbara's total contribution will be $9. Next, let's calculate the total cost of Mario and Rick's contribution. They will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles, which will cost $6 in total (3 dollars per package). Now, let's add up the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's. Barbara's contribution is $9, Mario and Rick's contribution is $6, and Danica's contribution is $4. Therefore, the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's is $19. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of Sonja's contribution. She will buy a loaf of French bread for $3 and a platter of cold cuts for $23. Therefore, Sonja's total contribution will be $26. To find out how much more Sonja will spend than the rest of the office put together, we need to subtract the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's from Sonja's total contribution. $26 (Sonja's contribution) - $19 (total cost of everyone else's contribution) = $7 Therefore, Sonja will spend $7 more than the rest of the office put together. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Frank's laundry detergent is double concentrated and will wash 80 loads of laundry.  His detergent is usually $25.00 a bottle but they're having a sale.  If he buys 2 bottles, both bottles will drop to $20.00 a bottle.  How much does he spend, in cents, per load of laundry, if he buys 2 bottles of detergent?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the cost of one bottle of detergent during the sale: $25.00 - $20.00 = $5.00 discount per bottle $25.00 - $5.00 = $20.00 per bottle during the sale Since Frank buys 2 bottles during the sale, he spends: 2 bottles x $20.00 per bottle = $40.00 Now, let's calculate the cost per load of laundry: $40.00 for 2 bottles x 80 loads per bottle = 160 loads $40.00 for 160 loads = $0.25 per load Therefore, Frank spends 25 cents per load of laundry if he buys 2 bottles of detergent during the sale. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Samuel is going to the cinema with his brother, Kevin. They both have a total budget of $20 for their outing. Samuel buys his $14 ticket, then spends $6 on drinks and food. Kevin buys his ticket, then spends $2 on drinks. They have both used their entire budget. How much did Kevin spend on food?\nA: Let's think step by step. Samuel spent $14 on his ticket and $6 on food and drinks, which means he spent a total of $20. This means that Kevin must have spent $0 on food and drinks, since they both used their entire budget of $20. Therefore, Kevin spent $6 on his ticket and $2 on drinks, which means he spent a total of $8. Since he didn't spend any money on food, the answer is $0. The answer is 0.\n\n\nQ: John buys 500 newspapers.  Each newspaper sells for $2.  He sells 80% of them.  He buys them all for 75% less than the price at which he sells them.  How much profit does he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much John buys the newspapers for. He buys them for 75% less than the price at which he sells them, which means he buys them for 25% of the selling price. 25% of the selling price = 0.25 x 2 = $0.50 So, John buys each newspaper for $0.50. Next, let's calculate how much John earns from selling the newspapers. He sells 80% of the 500 newspapers, which is: 0.8 x 500 = 400 newspapers He sells each newspaper for $2, so his total earnings are: 400 x 2 = $800 Now, let's calculate how much John spent on buying the newspapers: 500 x 0.50 = $250 Therefore, John's profit is: $800 - $250 = $550 So, John makes a profit of $550. The answer is 550.\n\n\nQ: A gallon of whole milk that normally costs $3 is now sold at $2. A box of cereal was sold at a discount of $1. How much will you save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the discount for each gallon of whole milk. The discount is $3 - $2 = $1 per gallon. So, if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk, you will save 3 x $1 = $3. Next, let's calculate the discount for each box of cereal. The discount is $1 per box. So, if you buy 5 boxes of cereal, you will save 5 x $1 = $5. Therefore, the total amount you will save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal is $3 + $5 = $8. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: John buys game loot boxes for $5 each.  The average value of items inside is $3.5.   He spends $40 on loot boxes.  What is the average amount he lost?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many loot boxes John bought. We can do this by dividing the total amount he spent by the cost of each loot box: 40 / 5 = 8 So John bought 8 loot boxes. Next, we need to find out the total value of the items inside all the loot boxes. We can do this by multiplying the average value of each box by the number of boxes: 3.5 x 8 = 28 So the total value of the items inside all the loot boxes is $28. Finally, we can find out the average amount John lost by subtracting the total value of the items from the total amount he spent: 40 - 28 = 12 So John lost an average of $12 on each loot box. The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: Marco has $24. Mary has $15. If Marco gives Mary half of what he has, Mary will have more than Marco. But Mary spends $5. How much more money does Mary have than Marco?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much money Marco gives to Mary. Since Marco has $24, half of that would be $12. So, Marco gives $12 to Mary. After receiving $12 from Marco, Mary will have $15 + $12 = $27. However, Mary spends $5, so we need to subtract that from her total. $27 - $5 = $22. Therefore, Mary has $22 more than Marco. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: A laboratory needs flasks, test tubes, and safety gear to carry out its experiments. They were given a $325 budget for the month. They bought $150 worth of flasks, spent two-thirds of that amount on test tubes, and used half of the test tube cost on safety gear. How many dollars of their budget remained?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that they spent $150 on flasks. Next, we need to find out how much they spent on test tubes. We know they spent two-thirds of the flask cost on test tubes, so: $150 x 2/3 = $100 So they spent $100 on test tubes. Finally, we need to find out how much they spent on safety gear. We know they spent half of the test tube cost on safety gear, so: $100 / 2 = $50 So they spent $50 on safety gear. To find out how much of their budget remained, we need to subtract the total amount spent from the initial budget: $325 - $150 - $100 - $50 = $25 Therefore, they have $25 of their budget remaining. The answer is 25.\n\n\n"
