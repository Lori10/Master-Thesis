  "test_question": "Q: Two friends are playing pick-up sticks. While playing, they noticed that there are 9 red sticks, and 5 more blue sticks than red. Also, the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. How many sticks do they have?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: There are 50 marbles in a box which has a mixture of white, red and blue marbles. There were originally 20 white marbles and an equal number of red and blue marbles. Jack removes a number of marbles equal to double the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles. How many marbles are left in the box?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 20 white marbles and an equal number of red and blue marbles. So, we can say that there are 20 white, 15 red, and 15 blue marbles in the box. Next, we need to find the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles. In this case, the difference is 20 - 15 = 5. Then, we need to double that difference, which gives us 5 x 2 = 10. Jack removes 10 marbles from the box. So, the number of marbles left in the box is 50 - 10 = 40 marbles. The answer is 40.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Grady has 20 red numbered cubes and 15 blue numbered cubes. He gives his friend Gage 2/5 of his red numbered cubes and 1/3 of the blue numbered cubes. If Gage had 10 red numbered cubes and 12 blue numbered cubes, find the total number of cubes Gage has?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red numbered cubes Grady gave to Gage. Grady gave 2/5 of his 20 red numbered cubes, which is: 2/5 x 20 = 8 red numbered cubes Next, we need to find out how many blue numbered cubes Grady gave to Gage. Grady gave 1/3 of his 15 blue numbered cubes, which is: 1/3 x 15 = 5 blue numbered cubes Now we know that Gage has 10 red numbered cubes and 12 blue numbered cubes, which means he received 8 red numbered cubes and 5 blue numbered cubes from Grady. To find the total number of cubes Gage has, we can add up all the cubes: 10 (red numbered cubes) + 12 (blue numbered cubes) + 8 (red numbered cubes from Grady) + 5 (blue numbered cubes from Grady) = 35 cubes Therefore, Gage has a total of 35 cubes. The answer is 35.\n\n\nQ: There are 5 green candies, 3 blue candies, and 4 red candies in a bag. If Violet randomly picks a candy from the bag, how likely is it that it's blue?\nA: Let's think step by step. There are a total of 5 + 3 + 4 = 12 candies in the bag. The probability of picking a blue candy is the number of blue candies divided by the total number of candies: P(blue) = 3/12 Simplifying this fraction, we get: P(blue) = 1/4 Therefore, the probability of picking a blue candy is 1/4 or 25%. The answer is 25.\n\n\nQ: On a moonless night, three fireflies danced in the evening breeze.  They were joined by four less than a dozen more fireflies, before two of the fireflies flew away.  How many fireflies remained?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there were three fireflies dancing. Then, four less than a dozen (which is 12) more fireflies joined them. So, we can add 12-4=8 fireflies to the original three, making a total of 11 fireflies. Next, two of the fireflies flew away, so we need to subtract 2 from the 11 fireflies. Therefore, the final answer is 11-2=9 fireflies remained. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Sally, Sam, and Steve went to play with their marbles. In the beginning, Sam has twice as many marbles as Steve while Sally has 5 less than Sam. After Sam has given Sally and Steve 3 marbles each, Sam has 8 marbles left. How many marbles does Steve have now?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Sam had in the beginning. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve, so let's call the number of marbles Steve had \"x\". This means that Sam had 2x marbles. Next, we know that Sally had 5 less marbles than Sam, so Sally had 2x - 5 marbles. After Sam gave 3 marbles each to Sally and Steve, he was left with 8 marbles. This means that he gave away a total of 6 marbles (3 to Sally and 3 to Steve), so he must have started with 14 marbles (8 + 6 = 14). Now we can use this information to figure out how many marbles Steve has. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve in the beginning, so if Sam had 14 marbles, Steve must have had 7 marbles (14 \u00f7 2 = 7). After Sam gave Steve 3 marbles, Steve now has 10 marbles (7 + 3 = 10). The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Hanna has twice as many erasers as Rachel.  Rachel has three less than one-half as many erasers as Tanya has red erasers.  If Tanya has 20 erasers, and half of them are red, how many erasers does Hanna have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red erasers Tanya has. We know that half of her erasers are red, so: 20/2 = 10 red erasers Next, we need to figure out how many erasers Rachel has. We know that Rachel has three less than one-half as many erasers as Tanya has red erasers, so: (1/2) * 20 - 3 = 7 erasers Finally, we need to find out how many erasers Hanna has, since we know she has twice as many as Rachel. Therefore: 2 * 7 = 14 erasers So, Hanna has 14 erasers. The answer is 14.\n\n\nQ: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Bertha started with two balls and gave one to her partner, so she has one ball left. Next, we need to figure out how many balls she loses and how many wear out. In 20 games, she loses 20/5 = 4 balls and 20/10 = 2 balls wear out. Finally, we need to figure out how many balls she buys. In 20 games, she buys 20/4 = 5 canisters of three balls, which is a total of 5*3 = 15 balls. So, in total, Bertha has 1 (starting ball) - 4 (lost balls) - 2 (worn out balls) + 15 (bought balls) = 10 tennis balls. The answer is 10.\n\n\n"
