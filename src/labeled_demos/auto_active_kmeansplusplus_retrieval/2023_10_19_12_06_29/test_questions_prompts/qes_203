  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Dani brings two and half dozen cupcakes for her 2nd-grade class.  There are 27 students (including Dani), 1 teacher, and 1 teacher\u2019s aid.  If 3 students called in sick that day, how many cupcakes are left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Dani brought in total. Two and a half dozen cupcakes is equal to 30 cupcakes (since a dozen is 12). Next, we need to figure out how many people will be receiving cupcakes. There are 27 students, 1 teacher, and 1 teacher's aid, for a total of 29 people. However, 3 students called in sick, so we need to subtract them from the total. 29 - 3 = 26 people receiving cupcakes. Now, we need to subtract 26 cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes Dani brought. 30 - 26 = 4 cupcakes left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Talia is playing football with her friends. The park they're playing at is 5 miles from Talia's house. After their game, Talia is planning to go to the grocery store 3 miles away from the park and 8 miles from her home. Starting and ending at Talia's house, how many miles does Talia drive that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Talia drives 5 miles from her house to the park. Then, she drives 3 miles from the park to the grocery store. Finally, she drives 8 miles from the grocery store back to her house. To find the total distance Talia drives that day, we can add up these three distances: 5 miles + 3 miles + 8 miles = 16 miles Therefore, Talia drives a total of 16 miles that day. The answer is 16.\n\n\nQ: Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Phill cuts the pizza in half, which gives him 2 slices. Then he cuts both halves in half, which gives him 4 slices. And then he cuts each slice in half again, which gives him 8 slices in total. Next, Phill passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends, which means he gives away 3 slices in total. He also passes out 2 slices to 2 of his friends, which means he gives away 4 slices in total. Therefore, Phill has given away a total of 7 slices of pizza. If he started with 8 slices, then he has 1 slice left for himself. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Jenny lives 5000 feet from her school, and every day she walks home.  One day as she was walking home from school, she dropped 1 kernel of popcorn per 25 feet she walked.  Later that evening, a squirrel came and ate one-quarter of the popcorn Jenny had dropped on her way home.  If Jenny walks to school the following morning and counts the popcorn on the ground, what is the total number of popcorn kernels she will find remaining on the ground?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many kernels of popcorn Jenny dropped on her way home. To do this, we can divide the distance she walked (5000 feet) by the distance per kernel (25 feet per kernel): 5000 feet / 25 feet per kernel = 200 kernels of popcorn Next, we need to find out how many kernels of popcorn the squirrel ate. To do this, we can multiply the total number of kernels by one-quarter: 200 kernels x 1/4 = 50 kernels of popcorn eaten by the squirrel Finally, we can subtract the number of kernels eaten by the squirrel from the total number of kernels dropped by Jenny to find the number of kernels remaining on the ground: 200 kernels - 50 kernels = 150 kernels of popcorn remaining on the ground Therefore, Jenny will find 150 kernels of popcorn remaining on the ground when she walks to school the following morning. The answer is 150.\n\n\nQ: Emery's family decides to travel for a weekend trip. They drive the first 100 miles in 1 hour. They stop at a McDonald's and then continue the rest of the journey for 300 miles. What's the total number of hours they traveled?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, they drove 100 miles in 1 hour. Then, they stopped at McDonald's, which we don't know how long it took. Finally, they continued the rest of the journey for 300 miles. So, the total distance they traveled is 100 + 300 = 400 miles. We know they drove the first 100 miles in 1 hour, but we don't know how long they stopped at McDonald's. Let's call that time \"x\". Then, they drove the remaining 300 miles. Let's call the time it took to drive that distance \"y\". So, the total time they traveled is: 1 hour (for the first 100 miles) + x (for the time they stopped at McDonald's) + y (for the remaining 300 miles) We don't know x or y, but we do know that the total time they traveled is the sum of those three values. Therefore, the answer is: Total time = 1 + x + y hours. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: There are 5 green candies, 3 blue candies, and 4 red candies in a bag. If Violet randomly picks a candy from the bag, how likely is it that it's blue?\nA: Let's think step by step. There are a total of 5 + 3 + 4 = 12 candies in the bag. The probability of picking a blue candy is the number of blue candies divided by the total number of candies: P(blue) = 3/12 Simplifying this fraction, we get: P(blue) = 1/4 Therefore, the probability of picking a blue candy is 1/4 or 25%. The answer is 25.\n\n\nQ: Dylan's mother is throwing a baby shower for her best friend. She is expecting 40 guests, of whom she has cleared the parking lot to park in to, leaving only her car and her husband's jeep in the parking lot. The 40 guests, though, arrive in only 10 cars that they park in the parking lot.  If each car has 4 wheels, how many car wheels are there in the parking lot, including both of Dylan's parent's car wheels?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many wheels the 10 cars have in total. Since each car has 4 wheels, we can multiply 10 by 4 to get: 10 x 4 = 40 So, the 10 cars have a total of 40 wheels. Next, we need to add the wheels of Dylan's parent's cars. Since we know they have one car and one jeep, we can calculate the total number of wheels by adding the number of wheels for each vehicle. A car has 4 wheels and a jeep has 4 wheels, so we can add: 4 + 4 = 8 Therefore, there are a total of 40 + 8 = 48 wheels in the parking lot, including both of Dylan's parent's car wheels. The answer is 48.\n\n\nQ: Cleo and Ignacio placed 30 of their marbles in a jar on a Monday. They took 3/5 of the marbles from the jar the next day and divided them equally. On the third day, Cleo took 1/2 of the marbles remaining in the jars. How many marbles did Cleo have on the third day?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many marbles were taken from the jar on the second day. 3/5 of 30 marbles = (3/5) x 30 = 18 marbles So, 18 marbles were taken from the jar on the second day. Step 2: Find out how many marbles were left in the jar after the second day. 30 - 18 = 12 marbles So, 12 marbles were left in the jar after the second day. Step 3: Find out how many marbles Cleo took on the third day. 1/2 of 12 marbles = (1/2) x 12 = 6 marbles So, Cleo took 6 marbles on the third day. Step 4: Find out how many marbles Cleo had on the third day. Cleo had 6 marbles on the third day. Therefore, Cleo had 6 marbles on the third day. The answer is 6.\n\n\n"
