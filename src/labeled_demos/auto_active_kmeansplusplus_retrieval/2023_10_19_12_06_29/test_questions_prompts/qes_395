  "formatted_prompt": "Q: James gets paid $0.50/mile to drive a truck carrying hazardous waste. He has to pay $4.00/gallon for gas and his truck gets 20 miles per gallon. How much profit does he make from a 600 mile trip?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how many gallons of gas James will need for the trip. To do this, we divide the total distance by the truck's gas mileage: 600 miles \u00f7 20 miles per gallon = 30 gallons of gas Next, we need to calculate how much James will spend on gas: 30 gallons x $4.00 per gallon = $120.00 Now we can calculate how much James will earn from the trip: 600 miles x $0.50 per mile = $300.00 Finally, we can calculate James' profit by subtracting the cost of gas from his earnings: $300.00 - $120.00 = $180.00 Therefore, James will make a profit of $180.00 from a 600 mile trip. The answer is 600.\n\n\nQ: Mitch has saved $20000 to finance his boating hobby. A new boat costs $1500 per foot in length. If Mitch needs to keep $500 for a license and registration, and three times that amount for docking fees, how many feet is the longest boat he can buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to subtract the amount Mitch needs to keep for license and registration and docking fees from his total savings: $20,000 - $500 - (3 x $500) = $18,500 Next, we need to divide this amount by the cost per foot of the boat: $18,500 \u00f7 $1500/ft = 12.33 ft Since we can't buy a fraction of a foot, we need to round down to the nearest whole number: The longest boat Mitch can buy is 12 feet long. The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: John adopts a dog from a shelter.  The dog ends up having health problems and this requires 3 vet appointments,  which cost $400 each.  After the first appointment, John paid $100 for pet insurance that covers 80% of the subsequent visits.  How much did he pay in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, John paid $400 for the first vet appointment. Then, he paid $100 for pet insurance that covers 80% of the subsequent visits. This means that for the next two vet appointments, he will only have to pay 20% of the cost. So for the second and third vet appointments, John will pay: 20% of $400 = $80 Therefore, the total cost for the three vet appointments will be: $400 (first appointment) + $80 (second appointment) + $80 (third appointment) = $560 So John paid a total of $560 for the three vet appointments. The answer is 560.\n\n\nQ: Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how much money Carl will earn in four weeks. If he earns $0.50 every time, and he buys a candy bar each time, that means he's spending $0.50 each week. But he's also earning $0.75 each week for taking out his neighbor's trash. So his net earnings each week are $0.75 - $0.50 = $0.25. Over four weeks, that's a total of $0.25 x 4 = $1. So Carl will have $1 to spend on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.50, he can buy 2 candy bars with his earnings. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Harris feeds his dog 1 large organic carrot over the course of 1 day.  There are 5 carrots in a 1 pound bag and each bag costs $2.00.  In one year, how much will Harris spend on carrots?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many pounds of carrots Harris will need in a year. Since he feeds his dog 1 carrot per day, he will need 365 carrots in a year. Next, we need to figure out how many bags of carrots he will need. If there are 5 carrots in a bag, then he will need 365/5 = 73 bags of carrots in a year. Finally, we can calculate the cost of the carrots. Each bag costs $2.00, so 73 bags will cost 73 x $2.00 = $146.00. Therefore, Harris will spend $146.00 on carrots in one year. The answer is 146.\n\n\nQ: Maria wants to paint a picture and needs some tools to do that. She wants to buy a set of brushes for $20 and some canvas for three times more than the brushes. The paint costs Maria $8 per liter, and she needs at least 5 liters. How much money will she earn on the painting if she will be able to sell it for $200?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much Maria will spend on canvas. We know that the canvas will cost three times more than the brushes, which are $20. So, 3 x $20 = $60 for the canvas. Next, let's calculate how much Maria will spend on paint. She needs at least 5 liters, and each liter costs $8. So, 5 x $8 = $40 for the paint. Now, let's add up all of Maria's expenses: $20 for brushes + $60 for canvas + $40 for paint = $120 total expenses. If Maria sells the painting for $200, she will earn $200 - $120 = $80 profit. The answer is 80.\n\n\nQ: Grant spends $200.00 a year to have the newspaper delivered daily to his house.  Juanita buys the newspaper daily.  Monday through Saturday, she spends $0.50 and on Sunday she spends $2.00.  How much more money does Juanita spend buying the newspaper yearly than Grant?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper daily from Monday to Saturday: $0.50 x 6 = $3.00 Now, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper on Sundays: $2.00 x 1 = $2.00 Next, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper weekly: $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00 Finally, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper yearly: $5.00 x 52 = $260.00 Now, let's calculate the difference between what Juanita spends and what Grant spends: $260.00 - $200.00 = $60.00 Therefore, Juanita spends $60.00 more buying the newspaper yearly than Grant. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Carson runs a carpool for five of his friends. The five of them cover all the gas expenses to compensate Carson for his time. Their total commute is 21 miles one way, gas costs $2.50/gallon, Carson's car gets 30 miles/gallon, and they commute to work 5 days a week, 4 weeks a month. How much does each person pay toward gas monthly?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per day. Since they commute 21 miles one way, their round trip is 21 x 2 = 42 miles. Next, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per week. They commute 42 miles per day, and they commute 5 days a week, so they commute 42 x 5 = 210 miles per week. Then, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per month. They commute 210 miles per week, and they commute 4 weeks a month, so they commute 210 x 4 = 840 miles per month. Now, we need to find out how many gallons of gas they need per month. Carson's car gets 30 miles per gallon, and they commute 840 miles per month, so they need 840/30 = 28 gallons of gas per month. Finally, we need to find out how much each person pays toward gas monthly. The total cost of gas is $2.50 per gallon, and they need 28 gallons of gas per month, so the total cost of gas is 2.5 x 28 = $70 per month. Since there are 6 people in the carpool (Carson and his 5 friends), each person pays 70/6 = $11.67 toward gas monthly. The answer is 12.\n\n\n"
