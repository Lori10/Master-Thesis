  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Johnny is buying planks of wood to build some tables. Each table needs a plank of wood for each of the legs and 5 planks of wood for the surface. If Johnny wants to build 5 tables, how many planks of wood does he need?\nA: Let's think step by step. Each table needs 4 planks of wood for the legs (assuming it's a standard table with 4 legs). So for 5 tables, Johnny needs 5 x 4 = 20 planks of wood for the legs. Each table also needs 5 planks of wood for the surface, so for 5 tables, Johnny needs 5 x 5 = 25 planks of wood for the surfaces. Therefore, Johnny needs a total of 20 + 25 = 45 planks of wood to build 5 tables. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: James wants to build a ladder to climb a very tall tree.  Each rung of the ladder is 18 inches long and they are 6 inches apart.  If he needs to climb 50 feet how many feet of wood will he need for the rungs?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 50 feet to inches since the length of the rungs is given in inches. 50 feet = 600 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches) Next, we need to figure out how many rungs James will need. We know that each rung is 18 inches long and they are 6 inches apart. So, the total length of each \"rung + gap\" is 24 inches. To find the number of rungs, we can divide the total height of the ladder (600 inches) by the length of each \"rung + gap\" (24 inches). 600 inches \u00f7 24 inches = 25 rungs Finally, we can calculate the total length of wood needed for the rungs by multiplying the length of each rung (18 inches) by the number of rungs (25). 18 inches x 25 rungs = 450 inches To convert this back to feet, we divide by 12: 450 inches \u00f7 12 inches/foot = 37.5 feet So James will need 37.5 feet of wood for the rungs of his ladder. The answer is 38.\n\n\nQ: If a rectangle has a width of 42 inches and an area of 1638, how many rectangles of the same size would reach a length of 390 inches?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length of the rectangle with a width of 42 inches and an area of 1638. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width. Area = length x width 1638 = length x 42 Dividing both sides by 42: length = 1638/42 length = 39 So the length of the rectangle is 39 inches. Next, we need to find how many of these rectangles with a length of 39 inches can fit into a length of 390 inches. We can divide the total length by the length of one rectangle: 390/39 = 10 So 10 rectangles of the same size would reach a length of 390 inches. The answer is 390.\n\n\nQ: Cynthia wants floor-to-ceiling curtains made with an additional 5\" of material so it will pool at the bottom. If her room is 8 feet tall, how long will the curtains need to be?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 8 feet to inches since the additional 5 inches will be added to the length. 8 feet = 96 inches Next, we add the additional 5 inches: 96 inches + 5 inches = 101 inches Therefore, the curtains will need to be 101 inches long. The answer is 101.\n\n\nQ: Betsy is sewing a quilt.  The quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side.  Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together.  How many more squares does she need to sew together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many squares Betsy has already sewn together. If the quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side, then the total number of squares in the quilt is: 16 x 16 = 256 squares If Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together, then she has sewn: 0.25 x 256 = 64 squares Now we need to find out how many more squares she needs to sew together. To do this, we can subtract the number of squares she has already sewn from the total number of squares in the quilt: 256 - 64 = 192 squares So Betsy still needs to sew together 192 squares to complete the quilt. The answer is 192.\n\n\nQ: A 1165 cm long rope is cut into 154 pieces. 150 of the pieces are equally sized and the remaining pieces are 100mm each. Find the length of each of the equal pieces in millimeters.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total length of the 100mm pieces. There are 154 pieces in total, and 150 of them are equal in size. So, the remaining 4 pieces must be the 100mm pieces. 4 pieces x 100mm/piece = 400mm Now, we can subtract the length of the 100mm pieces from the total length of the rope: 1165cm - 40cm = 1125cm We know that the 150 equal pieces are the same size, so we can divide the remaining length by 150 to find the length of each piece: 1125cm \u00f7 150 pieces = 7.5cm/piece Finally, we need to convert centimeters to millimeters: 7.5cm/piece x 10mm/cm = 75mm/piece Therefore, each of the equal pieces is 75 millimeters long. The answer is 75.\n\n\nQ: Alex was having a cookout Friday night and planned to serve burgers to his guests.  He planned to cook 3 burgers for each guest and had invited 10 friends over.  1 of his friends didn't eat meat and said they would bring their own food.  Another one of his friends didn't eat bread and would not need the buns.  The burger buns came 8 to a pack.  How many packs of buns did Alex need to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many guests will be eating burgers. Alex invited 10 friends, but one won't be eating meat, so there will be 9 guests eating burgers. Next, we need to figure out how many burgers Alex will need to cook. He plans to cook 3 burgers for each guest, so he will need to cook 3 x 9 = 27 burgers. Now we need to figure out how many buns Alex will need. Each burger needs 2 buns, but one of his friends won't be eating the buns, so he will only need 2 x 26 = 52 buns. Since the buns come 8 to a pack, we need to divide 52 by 8 to find out how many packs of buns Alex needs to buy. 52 \u00f7 8 = 6.5 Since we can't buy half a pack of buns, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So Alex needs to buy 7 packs of buns. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Adam has just bought some new books so he has decided to clean up his bookcase. After he adds his new books to his bookshelf he realizes that he has bought enough books to finish completely filling his bookcase with 2 books left over. Before his shopping trip, Adam had 56 books in his bookcase. If his bookcase has 4 shelves and averages 20 books per shelf, how many books did Adam buy on his shopping trip?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many books can fit on Adam's bookcase. We know that he has 4 shelves and each shelf can hold an average of 20 books, so the total capacity of his bookcase is: 4 shelves x 20 books per shelf = 80 books Next, we need to figure out how many books Adam had before his shopping trip. We know that he had 56 books in his bookcase before he bought any new books. Now, we can use the information given in the problem to figure out how many books Adam bought on his shopping trip. We know that he bought enough books to completely fill his bookcase with 2 books left over. This means that he bought: 80 books - 2 books left over = 78 books Therefore, Adam bought 78 books on his shopping trip. The answer is 78.\n\n\n"
