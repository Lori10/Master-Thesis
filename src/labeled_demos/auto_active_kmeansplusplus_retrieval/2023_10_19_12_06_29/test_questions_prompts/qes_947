  "test_question": "Q: A farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from a cow. Since he has 3 cows, how many more cows does he need to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much milk one cow produces in a week. We can do this by dividing the total amount of milk produced in 5 weeks (2160 liters) by the number of weeks (5) and the number of cows (x): 2160 = 6x * 108 * 5 2160 = 540x x = 4 Therefore, there are 4 cows on the farm. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Ivar owns a stable. He recently has 3 horses and each horse consumes 5 liters of water for drinking and 2 liters for bathing per day. If he added 5 horses, how many liters of water does Ivar need for all the horses for 28 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total amount of water consumed by one horse per day. Each horse consumes 5 liters of water for drinking and 2 liters for bathing per day, so the total amount of water consumed by one horse per day is 5 + 2 = 7 liters. Next, we need to calculate the total amount of water consumed by all the horses per day. Ivar has 3 horses, so the total amount of water consumed by all the horses per day is 3 x 7 = 21 liters. If he added 5 more horses, he would have a total of 3 + 5 = 8 horses. So, the total amount of water consumed by all the horses per day with 8 horses is 8 x 7 = 56 liters. Finally, we need to calculate the total amount of water needed for all the horses for 28 days. The total amount of water needed for all the horses for 28 days is 28 x 56 = 1,568 liters. Therefore, Ivar needs 1,568 liters of water for all the horses for 28 days. The answer is 28.\n\n\nQ: A gallon of whole milk that normally costs $3 is now sold at $2. A box of cereal was sold at a discount of $1. How much will you save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the discount for each gallon of whole milk. The discount is $3 - $2 = $1 per gallon. So, if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk, you will save 3 x $1 = $3. Next, let's calculate the discount for each box of cereal. The discount is $1 per box. So, if you buy 5 boxes of cereal, you will save 5 x $1 = $5. Therefore, the total amount you will save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal is $3 + $5 = $8. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Janet uses her horses' manure as fertilizer. One horse produces 5 gallons of fertilizer per day. Once Janet has collected enough fertilizer, she'll spread it over 20 acres of farmland. Each acre needs 400 gallons of fertilizer and Janet can spread fertilizer over 4 acres per day. If Janet has 80 horses, how long will it take until all her fields are fertilized?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much fertilizer is needed for all 20 acres. Since each acre needs 400 gallons of fertilizer, we can multiply 20 acres by 400 gallons per acre to get: 20 acres x 400 gallons per acre = 8,000 gallons of fertilizer Next, we need to figure out how many days it will take Janet to spread all the fertilizer. Since she can spread fertilizer over 4 acres per day, we can divide the total number of acres by 4 to get: 20 acres \u00f7 4 acres per day = 5 days So it will take Janet 5 days to spread all the fertilizer. Now we need to figure out how much fertilizer she can collect each day. Since each horse produces 5 gallons of fertilizer per day, and she has 80 horses, we can multiply 5 gallons per horse by 80 horses to get: 5 gallons per horse x 80 horses = 400 gallons of fertilizer per day So Janet can collect 400 gallons of fertilizer per day. Finally, we can divide the total amount of fertilizer needed by the amount of fertilizer she can collect per day to get: 8,000 gallons of fertilizer \u00f7 400 gallons per day = 20 days So it will take Janet 20 days to collect enough fertilizer to fertilize all her fields. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: A water tower that serves four neighborhoods around it holds 1200 barrels of water and is filled to the top each week. If one neighborhood uses 150 barrels of water in a week, the second neighborhood uses twice as many barrels of water as the first neighborhood in a week, and the third neighborhood uses one hundred more barrels of water than the second neighborhood in a week, how many barrels are left for the fourth neighborhood?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many barrels of water the second neighborhood uses in a week. We know that the first neighborhood uses 150 barrels, so the second neighborhood uses twice as many, which is 150 x 2 = 300 barrels. Next, we need to find out how many barrels of water the third neighborhood uses in a week. We know that the third neighborhood uses 100 more barrels than the second neighborhood, so that's 300 + 100 = 400 barrels. Now, we can add up the barrels of water used by the first three neighborhoods: 150 + 300 + 400 = 850 barrels. We know that the water tower holds 1200 barrels of water and is filled to the top each week, so to find out how many barrels are left for the fourth neighborhood, we can subtract the barrels used by the first three neighborhoods from the total capacity of the water tower: 1200 - 850 = 350 barrels. Therefore, the fourth neighborhood has 350 barrels of water left for the week. The answer is 350.\n\n\nQ: Carla is making smoothies. If she uses 500 ml of watermelon puree and 100 ml of cream, how many 150 ml servings can she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine the total volume of each serving. To do this, we add the volume of watermelon puree and cream: 500 ml + 100 ml = 600 ml Next, we need to divide the total volume by the volume of each serving: 600 ml \u00f7 150 ml/serving = 4 servings Therefore, Carla can make 4 servings of smoothies with 500 ml of watermelon puree and 100 ml of cream. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of 18 watermelons. Since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, the total weight of 18 watermelons would be: 23 x 18 = 414 pounds Next, we need to find the total amount of money Farmer Kent would make by selling these watermelons. Since he sells them for $2 a pound, we can multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 414 x $2 = $828 Therefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight. The answer is 18.\n\n\n"
