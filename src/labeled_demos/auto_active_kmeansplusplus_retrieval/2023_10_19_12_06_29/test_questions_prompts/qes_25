  "formatted_prompt": "Q: John buys 500 newspapers.  Each newspaper sells for $2.  He sells 80% of them.  He buys them all for 75% less than the price at which he sells them.  How much profit does he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much John buys the newspapers for. He buys them for 75% less than the price at which he sells them, which means he buys them for 25% of the selling price. 25% of the selling price = 0.25 x 2 = $0.50 So, John buys each newspaper for $0.50. Next, let's calculate how much John earns from selling the newspapers. He sells 80% of the 500 newspapers, which is: 0.8 x 500 = 400 newspapers He sells each newspaper for $2, so his total earnings are: 400 x 2 = $800 Now, let's calculate how much John spent on buying the newspapers: 500 x 0.50 = $250 Therefore, John's profit is: $800 - $250 = $550 So, John makes a profit of $550. The answer is 550.\n\n\nQ: Fran\u00e7oise sells pots of lily of the valley to fund humanitarian work. She buys them at \u20ac12 each and sells them at a 25% higher cost. How much will she give back to the association by selling 150 pots of lily of the valley?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the selling price of each pot of lily of the valley. Fran\u00e7oise sells them at a 25% higher cost than the buying price of \u20ac12, so we need to add 25% of \u20ac12 to \u20ac12: 25% of \u20ac12 = 0.25 x \u20ac12 = \u20ac3 Selling price = \u20ac12 + \u20ac3 = \u20ac15 Now we know that Fran\u00e7oise sells each pot of lily of the valley for \u20ac15. To calculate how much she will give back to the association by selling 150 pots, we need to multiply the selling price by the number of pots sold: \u20ac15 x 150 = \u20ac2250 Therefore, Fran\u00e7oise will give back \u20ac2250 to the association by selling 150 pots of lily of the valley. The answer is 150.\n\n\nQ: A factory decides to stop making cars and start making motorcycles instead. When it made cars, per month, it cost $100 for materials, they could make 4 cars, and they sold each car for $50. Now that they make motorcycles it costs $250 for materials, but they sell 8 of them for $50 each. How much more profit do they make per month selling motorcycles instead of cars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the profit made per car: Revenue per car = $50 Cost per car = $100/4 = $25 Profit per car = Revenue per car - Cost per car = $50 - $25 = $25 Now, let's calculate the profit made per motorcycle: Revenue per motorcycle = $50 x 8 = $400 Cost per motorcycle = $250 Profit per motorcycle = Revenue per motorcycle - Cost per motorcycle = $400 - $250 = $150 Finally, let's calculate the difference in profit between making cars and making motorcycles: Profit difference = Profit per motorcycle - Profit per car = $150 - $25 = $125 Therefore, the factory makes $125 more profit per month by making motorcycles instead of cars. The answer is 125.\n\n\nQ: Apples used to cost $1.6 per pound.  The price got raised 25%.  How much does it cost to buy 2 pounds of apples for each person in a 4 member family?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Calculate the new price of apples after the 25% increase. The price increase is 25% of $1.6, which is (25/100) x $1.6 = $0.4. So, the new price of apples is $1.6 + $0.4 = $2. Step 2: Calculate the cost of buying 2 pounds of apples for each person in the family. Since there are 4 members in the family, we need to buy 2 x 4 = 8 pounds of apples in total. The cost of buying 1 pound of apples is $2, so the cost of buying 8 pounds of apples is 8 x $2 = $16. Therefore, it would cost $16 to buy 2 pounds of apples for each person in a 4 member family. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: A local restaurant is offering an 8 piece fried chicken bucket and 2 sides for $12.00 that will feed 6 people.  If Monty was having a family reunion for 36 family members, how much will it cost him to buy enough chicken and sides to feed everyone one serving?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many servings of chicken and sides Monty needs to feed 36 people. Since the restaurant's 8 piece fried chicken bucket feeds 6 people, we can calculate that Monty needs 6 buckets of chicken to feed 36 people. Next, we need to figure out how many sides Monty needs. The restaurant offers 2 sides with each 8 piece chicken bucket, so Monty needs 6 x 2 = 12 sides. Now, we can calculate the total cost. Monty is paying $12.00 for 6 people, so he needs to pay 6/6 = 1 dollar per person. To feed 36 people, Monty needs to pay 36 x 1 = $36.00 for the chicken and sides. The answer is 36.\n\n\nQ: John is performing in 3 plays.  Each play has 5 Acts.  He wears 2 wigs per act.  Each wig cost $5.  He drops one of the plays and sells all of the wigs for that play for $4.  How much money did he spend?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many wigs John needs in total. Since he performs in 3 plays and each play has 5 acts, he needs 3 x 5 = 15 wigs in total. Next, we need to find out how much he spent on all the wigs. Since he wears 2 wigs per act, he needs 2 x 15 = 30 wigs in total. Each wig costs $5, so he spent 30 x $5 = $150 on all the wigs. Now, we need to find out how much money he made by selling the wigs from one of the plays. He sold all the wigs for $4 each, so he made 15 x $4 = $60. Finally, we need to subtract the money he made from the money he spent to find out how much money he spent in total. $150 - $60 = $90. Therefore, John spent $90 on all the wigs. The answer is 90.\n\n\nQ: A gallon of whole milk that normally costs $3 is now sold at $2. A box of cereal was sold at a discount of $1. How much will you save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the discount for each gallon of whole milk. The discount is $3 - $2 = $1 per gallon. So, if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk, you will save 3 x $1 = $3. Next, let's calculate the discount for each box of cereal. The discount is $1 per box. So, if you buy 5 boxes of cereal, you will save 5 x $1 = $5. Therefore, the total amount you will save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal is $3 + $5 = $8. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of 18 watermelons. Since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, the total weight of 18 watermelons would be: 23 x 18 = 414 pounds Next, we need to find the total amount of money Farmer Kent would make by selling these watermelons. Since he sells them for $2 a pound, we can multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 414 x $2 = $828 Therefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight. The answer is 18.\n\n\n"
