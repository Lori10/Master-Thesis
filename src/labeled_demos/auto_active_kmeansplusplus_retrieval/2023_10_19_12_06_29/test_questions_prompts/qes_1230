  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Johnny is buying planks of wood to build some tables. Each table needs a plank of wood for each of the legs and 5 planks of wood for the surface. If Johnny wants to build 5 tables, how many planks of wood does he need?\nA: Let's think step by step. Each table needs 4 planks of wood for the legs (assuming it's a standard table with 4 legs). So for 5 tables, Johnny needs 5 x 4 = 20 planks of wood for the legs. Each table also needs 5 planks of wood for the surface, so for 5 tables, Johnny needs 5 x 5 = 25 planks of wood for the surfaces. Therefore, Johnny needs a total of 20 + 25 = 45 planks of wood to build 5 tables. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: 7 out of 40 people in a cafeteria are wearing checkered shirts. The rest of the people are wearing vertical stripes and horizontal stripes. The number of people wearing horizontal stripes is 4 times as many as the people wearing checkered shirts. How many people are wearing vertical stripes?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that 7 out of 40 people are wearing checkered shirts. So, the number of people wearing horizontal and vertical stripes is 40 - 7 = 33. Step 2: We also know that the number of people wearing horizontal stripes is 4 times as many as the people wearing checkered shirts. So, the number of people wearing horizontal stripes is 4 x 7 = 28. Step 3: To find the number of people wearing vertical stripes, we can subtract the number of people wearing checkered and horizontal stripes from the total number of people. So, the number of people wearing vertical stripes is 33 - 7 - 28 = 6. Therefore, there are 6 people wearing vertical stripes in the cafeteria. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Dylan's mother is throwing a baby shower for her best friend. She is expecting 40 guests, of whom she has cleared the parking lot to park in to, leaving only her car and her husband's jeep in the parking lot. The 40 guests, though, arrive in only 10 cars that they park in the parking lot.  If each car has 4 wheels, how many car wheels are there in the parking lot, including both of Dylan's parent's car wheels?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many wheels the 10 cars have in total. Since each car has 4 wheels, we can multiply 10 by 4 to get: 10 x 4 = 40 So, the 10 cars have a total of 40 wheels. Next, we need to add the wheels of Dylan's parent's cars. Since we know they have one car and one jeep, we can calculate the total number of wheels by adding the number of wheels for each vehicle. A car has 4 wheels and a jeep has 4 wheels, so we can add: 4 + 4 = 8 Therefore, there are a total of 40 + 8 = 48 wheels in the parking lot, including both of Dylan's parent's car wheels. The answer is 48.\n\n\nQ: James has a small tree outside his window with 30 branches with 90 twigs per branch. 30% of the twigs sprout 4 leaves and the rest sprout 5 leaves. How many leaves are on the tree total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of twigs on the tree. We know that there are 30 branches with 90 twigs per branch, so: 30 branches x 90 twigs per branch = 2700 twigs Next, we need to find how many twigs sprout 4 leaves and how many sprout 5 leaves. We know that 30% of the twigs sprout 4 leaves, so: 30% of 2700 twigs = 0.3 x 2700 = 810 twigs sprout 4 leaves The remaining twigs sprout 5 leaves: 2700 twigs - 810 twigs = 1890 twigs sprout 5 leaves Now we can find the total number of leaves on the tree. Each twig that sprouts 4 leaves contributes 4 leaves, and each twig that sprouts 5 leaves contributes 5 leaves. So: 810 twigs x 4 leaves per twig = 3240 leaves from twigs that sprout 4 leaves 1890 twigs x 5 leaves per twig = 9450 leaves from twigs that sprout 5 leaves The total number of leaves on the tree is: 3240 leaves + 9450 leaves = 12690 leaves Therefore, there are 12690 leaves on the tree in total. The answer is 12690.\n\n\nQ: Farmer Brown raises emus, large birds. His flock has a total of 60 heads and legs. How many emus are in his flock?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine how many legs an emu has. Emus are birds, so they have two legs. Next, we need to determine how many legs are in the entire flock. If there are x emus in the flock, then there are 2x legs in total. We know that the total number of heads and legs is 60. So, we can set up an equation: 2x + x = 60 Simplifying: 3x = 60 x = 20 Therefore, there are 20 emus in Farmer Brown's flock. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Alex was having a cookout Friday night and planned to serve burgers to his guests.  He planned to cook 3 burgers for each guest and had invited 10 friends over.  1 of his friends didn't eat meat and said they would bring their own food.  Another one of his friends didn't eat bread and would not need the buns.  The burger buns came 8 to a pack.  How many packs of buns did Alex need to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many guests will be eating burgers. Alex invited 10 friends, but one won't be eating meat, so there will be 9 guests eating burgers. Next, we need to figure out how many burgers Alex will need to cook. He plans to cook 3 burgers for each guest, so he will need to cook 3 x 9 = 27 burgers. Now we need to figure out how many buns Alex will need. Each burger needs 2 buns, but one of his friends won't be eating the buns, so he will only need 2 x 26 = 52 buns. Since the buns come 8 to a pack, we need to divide 52 by 8 to find out how many packs of buns Alex needs to buy. 52 \u00f7 8 = 6.5 Since we can't buy half a pack of buns, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So Alex needs to buy 7 packs of buns. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: There are 50 oysters on the rocks at La Push Park and 72 crabs by the beach. Eric, who loves walking by the beach, makes a note of this and goes home. The next day, he realizes only half the number of Oysters were on the rocks, and only 2/3 the number of crabs as the previous day are on the beach. How many oysters and crabs did he count in total in the two days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Eric counted 50 oysters and 72 crabs, so the total number of oysters and crabs he counted on the first day is: 50 + 72 = 122 On the second day, Eric realized only half the number of oysters were on the rocks, which means there were: 50 / 2 = 25 oysters on the rocks on the second day And only 2/3 the number of crabs as the previous day were on the beach, which means there were: 72 x 2/3 = 48 crabs on the beach on the second day So the total number of oysters and crabs Eric counted on the second day is: 25 + 48 = 73 Therefore, the total number of oysters and crabs Eric counted in total in the two days is: 122 + 73 = 195 The answer is 195.\n\n\nQ: An airline company owns 5 airplanes. Every airplane they own has 20 rows with 7 seats in each row. Each airplane makes 2 flights a day. How many passengers can the airline company accommodate each day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many seats are in one airplane. We can do this by multiplying the number of rows by the number of seats in each row: 20 rows x 7 seats per row = 140 seats per airplane Next, we need to find out how many passengers can fly on one airplane in a day. Since each airplane makes 2 flights a day, we can multiply the number of seats per airplane by 2: 140 seats per airplane x 2 flights per day = 280 passengers per airplane per day Finally, we need to find out how many passengers the airline company can accommodate in a day with all 5 airplanes: 280 passengers per airplane per day x 5 airplanes = 1,400 passengers per day Therefore, the airline company can accommodate 1,400 passengers each day. The answer is 1400.\n\n\n"
