  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Janice can type 6 sentences per minute. Today at work, Janice continued working on a paper she started typing yesterday. She typed for 20 minutes, took a break, and typed 15 minutes longer. She then had to erase 40 sentences she had typed incorrectly. After a meeting, she typed for 18 minutes more. In all, the paper had 536 sentences by the end of today. How many sentences did she start with today?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many sentences Janice typed in the first 20 minutes: 6 sentences/minute x 20 minutes = 120 sentences Next, let's find out how many sentences Janice typed in the additional 15 minutes: 6 sentences/minute x 15 minutes = 90 sentences Now, let's subtract the 40 sentences she had to erase: 120 sentences + 90 sentences - 40 sentences = 170 sentences So, Janice typed 170 sentences before the meeting. We know that the paper had 536 sentences by the end of the day, so we can subtract the 170 sentences Janice typed before the meeting to find out how many sentences she started with: 536 sentences - 170 sentences = 366 sentences Therefore, Janice started with 366 sentences today. The answer is 366.\n\n\nQ: Peter and Kristin are to read 20 fantasy novels each in a week. Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin. If Peter reads one book in 18 hours, how long will Kristin read half of her books?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Peter to read one book. We know that he can read one book in 18 hours, so we can write: Peter's reading speed = 1 book / 18 hours Next, we need to find out how long it takes Kristin to read one book. We know that Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin, so we can write: Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * Peter's reading speed Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * (1 book / 18 hours) Kristin's reading speed = 1 book / 54 hours Now we can use Kristin's reading speed to find out how long it takes her to read half of her books. We know that she needs to read 20 books in a week, so she needs to read 10 books in half a week (3.5 days). We can write: Time to read 10 books = 10 books * (1 book / 54 hours) * (24 hours / 1 day) * (3.5 days) Time to read 10 books = 14 hours and 27 minutes Therefore, it will take Kristin 14 hours and 27 minutes to read half of her books. The answer is 27.\n\n\nQ: Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour. Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour.  Oliver can read 40 pages.  How many pages can Carter read in 1 hour?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Oliver can read 40 pages in 1 hour. Next, we know that Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour, so Lucy can read 40 + 20 = 60 pages in 1 hour. Finally, we know that Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour, so Carter can read 60 / 2 = 30 pages in 1 hour. Therefore, Carter can read 30 pages in 1 hour. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Some friends went hiking for 3.5 hours. They traveled 21 kilometers in that time. Birgit was 4 minutes/km faster than the average time. If Birgit kept the same pace, how many minutes would it take her to go 8 kilometers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the average speed of the group. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken: Average speed = distance/time = 21 km/3.5 hours = 6 km/hour Next, we need to find Birgit's speed. We know that she was 4 minutes/km faster than the average time, which means she completed each kilometer in (60-4) = 56 minutes. So her speed was: Birgit's speed = 1 km/56 minutes = 0.018 km/minute Finally, we need to find how long it would take Birgit to travel 8 kilometers at this speed. We can use the formula: Time = distance/speed Time = 8 km / 0.018 km/minute = 444.44 minutes So it would take Birgit approximately 444.44 minutes to travel 8 kilometers at the same pace. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Jill spends time every day talking to her boyfriend on the phone.  The first day of the week she spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend.  Each of the following days she spends twice as much time talking on the phone as the day before. After the 5th day her parents take the phone away from her because she was on it too long.  How much time did Jill spend talking to her boyfriend that week?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Jill spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend. On the second day, she spends twice as much time as the first day, which is 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 minutes. On the third day, she spends twice as much time as the second day, which is 2*10=<<2*10=20>>20 minutes. On the fourth day, she spends twice as much time as the third day, which is 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 minutes. On the fifth day, she spends twice as much time as the fourth day, which is 2*40=<<2*40=80>>80 minutes. Therefore, Jill spends a total of 5+10+20+40+80=<<5+10+20+40+80=155>>155 minutes talking to her boyfriend that week. The answer is 155.\n\n\nQ: Kwame studied for the history test for 2.5 hours. Connor studied for 1.5 hours and Lexia studied for 97 minutes. How many minutes more did Kwame and Connor study than Lexia?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert Kwame's study time from hours to minutes. We know that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, so: Kwame = 2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes Next, we need to convert Connor's study time from hours to minutes as well: Connor = 1.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 90 minutes Finally, we can add Kwame and Connor's study times together and subtract Lexia's study time to find the difference: Total study time = Kwame + Connor = 150 minutes + 90 minutes = 240 minutes Difference = Total study time - Lexia's study time = 240 minutes - 97 minutes = 143 minutes Therefore, Kwame and Connor studied 143 minutes more than Lexia. The answer is 143.\n\n\nQ: The white rabbit can hop 15 meters in one minute. The brown rabbit hops 12 meters per minute. What is the total distance the two rabbits will hop in 5 minutes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how far the white rabbit can hop in 5 minutes. To do this, we can multiply its speed by the time: 15 meters/minute x 5 minutes = 75 meters So the white rabbit can hop 75 meters in 5 minutes. Next, we need to find out how far the brown rabbit can hop in 5 minutes. Again, we can multiply its speed by the time: 12 meters/minute x 5 minutes = 60 meters So the brown rabbit can hop 60 meters in 5 minutes. To find the total distance the two rabbits will hop in 5 minutes, we simply add their distances: 75 meters + 60 meters = 135 meters Therefore, the two rabbits will hop a total distance of 135 meters in 5 minutes. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: A car driving cross-country traveled 180 miles in 4 hours. At this rate of speed, how many miles further will the car travel in the next 3 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the car's speed in miles per hour (mph). To do this, we divide the distance traveled by the time taken: Speed = Distance \u00f7 Time Speed = 180 miles \u00f7 4 hours Speed = 45 mph Now that we know the car's speed, we can use it to calculate how far it will travel in the next 3 hours: Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time Distance = 45 mph \u00d7 3 hours Distance = 135 miles Therefore, the car will travel 135 miles further in the next 3 hours. The answer is 3.\n\n\n"
