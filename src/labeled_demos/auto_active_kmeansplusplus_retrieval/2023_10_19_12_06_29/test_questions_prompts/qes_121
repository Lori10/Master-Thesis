  "test_question": "Q: John decides to buy new phones for him, his 2 kids, and his wife.  Each phone after the first 2 is half price.  If the phone price is $600 how much did he pay for them all?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: John buys 500 newspapers.  Each newspaper sells for $2.  He sells 80% of them.  He buys them all for 75% less than the price at which he sells them.  How much profit does he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much John buys the newspapers for. He buys them for 75% less than the price at which he sells them, which means he buys them for 25% of the selling price. 25% of the selling price = 0.25 x 2 = $0.50 So, John buys each newspaper for $0.50. Next, let's calculate how much John earns from selling the newspapers. He sells 80% of the 500 newspapers, which is: 0.8 x 500 = 400 newspapers He sells each newspaper for $2, so his total earnings are: 400 x 2 = $800 Now, let's calculate how much John spent on buying the newspapers: 500 x 0.50 = $250 Therefore, John's profit is: $800 - $250 = $550 So, John makes a profit of $550. The answer is 550.\n\n\nQ: Michael has $42. Michael gives away half the money to his brother. His brother then buys 3 dollars worth of candy. If his brother has $35 left, how much money, in dollars, did his brother have at first?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Michael had $42. Next, he gave away half of that money to his brother, which is $21. His brother then spent $3 on candy, leaving him with $35. To figure out how much money his brother had at first, we need to work backwards. If his brother had $35 after spending $3 on candy, then he had $38 before buying the candy. And if his brother received $21 from Michael, then he must have had $17 to begin with. Therefore, his brother had $17 at first. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Apples used to cost $1.6 per pound.  The price got raised 25%.  How much does it cost to buy 2 pounds of apples for each person in a 4 member family?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Calculate the new price of apples after the 25% increase. The price increase is 25% of $1.6, which is (25/100) x $1.6 = $0.4. So, the new price of apples is $1.6 + $0.4 = $2. Step 2: Calculate the cost of buying 2 pounds of apples for each person in the family. Since there are 4 members in the family, we need to buy 2 x 4 = 8 pounds of apples in total. The cost of buying 1 pound of apples is $2, so the cost of buying 8 pounds of apples is 8 x $2 = $16. Therefore, it would cost $16 to buy 2 pounds of apples for each person in a 4 member family. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Jim buys a wedding ring for $10,000.  He gets his wife a ring that is twice that much and sells the first one for half its value.  How much is he out of pocket?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Jim buys a wedding ring for $10,000. Next, we know that he gets his wife a ring that is twice that much, which means he spends $20,000 on her ring. Now, he sells the first ring for half its value, which means he sells it for $5,000. To find out how much Jim is out of pocket, we need to add up all of his expenses and subtract any income he received from selling the first ring. So, Jim's total expenses are $10,000 + $20,000 = $30,000. His income from selling the first ring is $5,000. Therefore, Jim is out of pocket $30,000 - $5,000 = $25,000. The answer is 25000.\n\n\nQ: Marco has $24. Mary has $15. If Marco gives Mary half of what he has, Mary will have more than Marco. But Mary spends $5. How much more money does Mary have than Marco?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much money Marco gives to Mary. Since Marco has $24, half of that would be $12. So, Marco gives $12 to Mary. After receiving $12 from Marco, Mary will have $15 + $12 = $27. However, Mary spends $5, so we need to subtract that from her total. $27 - $5 = $22. Therefore, Mary has $22 more than Marco. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Jill spends time every day talking to her boyfriend on the phone.  The first day of the week she spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend.  Each of the following days she spends twice as much time talking on the phone as the day before. After the 5th day her parents take the phone away from her because she was on it too long.  How much time did Jill spend talking to her boyfriend that week?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Jill spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend. On the second day, she spends twice as much time as the first day, which is 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 minutes. On the third day, she spends twice as much time as the second day, which is 2*10=<<2*10=20>>20 minutes. On the fourth day, she spends twice as much time as the third day, which is 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 minutes. On the fifth day, she spends twice as much time as the fourth day, which is 2*40=<<2*40=80>>80 minutes. Therefore, Jill spends a total of 5+10+20+40+80=<<5+10+20+40+80=155>>155 minutes talking to her boyfriend that week. The answer is 155.\n\n\nQ: Ayla has a customer care job whose primary role is to hear complaints from customers and advise them on the best way to solve their problems. She talks with each customer for a limited amount of time, and each phone call is charged five cents per minute. If each call lasts 1 hour, what's the phone bill at the end of the month if she manages to talk to 50 customers a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many minutes are in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, each call lasts 60 minutes. Next, we need to find out how many minutes Ayla spends on the phone each week. If she talks to 50 customers a week, and each call lasts 60 minutes, then she spends 50 x 60 = 3000 minutes on the phone each week. Now we can calculate the cost of the phone bill. Each minute costs five cents, so 3000 minutes will cost 3000 x $0.05 = $150. Therefore, the phone bill at the end of the month will be $150 x 4 = $600 if Ayla manages to talk to 50 customers a week. The answer is 50.\n\n\nQ: A math teacher had $100 to buy three different types of calculators. A basic calculator costs $8. A scientific calculator costs twice the price as the basic while a graphing calculator costs thrice the price as the scientific. How much change did she receive after buying those three different types of calculators?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many calculators of each type the teacher can buy with $100. Let's start with the basic calculator. Each basic calculator costs $8, so the teacher can buy 100/8 = 12.5 basic calculators. Since we can't buy half a calculator, we'll round down to 12 basic calculators. Next, let's figure out how many scientific calculators the teacher can buy. Each scientific calculator costs twice as much as a basic calculator, so it costs $8 x 2 = $16. With $100, the teacher can buy 100/16 = 6.25 scientific calculators. Again, we'll round down to 6 scientific calculators. Finally, let's figure out how many graphing calculators the teacher can buy. Each graphing calculator costs three times as much as a scientific calculator, so it costs $16 x 3 = $48. With $100, the teacher can buy 100/48 = 2.08 graphing calculators. We'll round down to 2 graphing calculators. So in total, the teacher can buy 12 basic calculators, 6 scientific calculators, and 2 graphing calculators. The cost of the basic calculators is 12 x $8 = $96. The cost of the scientific calculators is 6 x $16 = $96. The cost of the graphing calculators is 2 x $48 = $96. So the total cost of all the calculators is $96 + $96 + $96 = $288. The teacher started with $100, so she received $100 - $288 = -$188 in change. However, since she didn't have enough money to buy all the calculators she wanted, she actually owes $188. The answer is 188.\n\n\n"
