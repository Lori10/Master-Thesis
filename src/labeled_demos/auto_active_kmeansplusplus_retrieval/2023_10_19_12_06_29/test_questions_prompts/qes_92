  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Farmer Brown raises emus, large birds. His flock has a total of 60 heads and legs. How many emus are in his flock?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine how many legs an emu has. Emus are birds, so they have two legs. Next, we need to determine how many legs are in the entire flock. If there are x emus in the flock, then there are 2x legs in total. We know that the total number of heads and legs is 60. So, we can set up an equation: 2x + x = 60 Simplifying: 3x = 60 x = 20 Therefore, there are 20 emus in Farmer Brown's flock. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much milk one cow produces in a week. We can do this by dividing the total amount of milk produced in 5 weeks (2160 liters) by the number of weeks (5) and the number of cows (x): 2160 = 6x * 108 * 5 2160 = 540x x = 4 Therefore, there are 4 cows on the farm. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: At the zoo, there are 5 different types of animals. Seeing each animal type takes around 6 minutes. How much time would it take to see each animal type if the zoo decided to import 4 new species?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many animal types there will be in total after the zoo imports 4 new species. 5 (original animal types) + 4 (new species) = 9 (total animal types) Next, we need to find out how long it takes to see each animal type. 6 minutes per animal type x 9 animal types = 54 minutes Therefore, it would take 54 minutes to see each animal type if the zoo decided to import 4 new species. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Jeff has a shelter where he currently takes care of 20 cats. On Monday he found 2 kittens in a box and took them to the shelter. On Tuesday he found 1 more cat with a leg injury. On Wednesday 3 people adopted 2 cats each. How many cats does Jeff currently have in his shelter?\nA: Let's think step by step. Jeff had 20 cats in his shelter. On Monday he found 2 kittens and took them to the shelter, so he now has 20 + 2 = 22 cats. On Tuesday he found 1 more cat with a leg injury, so he now has 22 + 1 = 23 cats. On Wednesday, 3 people adopted 2 cats each, which means a total of 3 x 2 = 6 cats were adopted. Therefore, Jeff currently has 23 - 6 = 17 cats in his shelter. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Dylan's mother is throwing a baby shower for her best friend. She is expecting 40 guests, of whom she has cleared the parking lot to park in to, leaving only her car and her husband's jeep in the parking lot. The 40 guests, though, arrive in only 10 cars that they park in the parking lot.  If each car has 4 wheels, how many car wheels are there in the parking lot, including both of Dylan's parent's car wheels?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many wheels the 10 cars have in total. Since each car has 4 wheels, we can multiply 10 by 4 to get: 10 x 4 = 40 So, the 10 cars have a total of 40 wheels. Next, we need to add the wheels of Dylan's parent's cars. Since we know they have one car and one jeep, we can calculate the total number of wheels by adding the number of wheels for each vehicle. A car has 4 wheels and a jeep has 4 wheels, so we can add: 4 + 4 = 8 Therefore, there are a total of 40 + 8 = 48 wheels in the parking lot, including both of Dylan's parent's car wheels. The answer is 48.\n\n\nQ: On a moonless night, three fireflies danced in the evening breeze.  They were joined by four less than a dozen more fireflies, before two of the fireflies flew away.  How many fireflies remained?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there were three fireflies dancing. Then, four less than a dozen (which is 12) more fireflies joined them. So, we can add 12-4=8 fireflies to the original three, making a total of 11 fireflies. Next, two of the fireflies flew away, so we need to subtract 2 from the 11 fireflies. Therefore, the final answer is 11-2=9 fireflies remained. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Six more than twice as many ducks go to North Pond as go to Lake Michigan. If Lake Michigan has 100 ducks, how many ducks can you safely estimate there will be at North Pond?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many ducks go to North Pond. We know that \"Six more than twice as many ducks go to North Pond as go to Lake Michigan.\" So, we can start by finding twice as many ducks as Lake Michigan: 2 x 100 = 200 Now, we add six to that: 200 + 6 = 206 Therefore, we can safely estimate that there will be 206 ducks at North Pond. The answer is 206.\n\n\n"
