  "test_question": "Q: A wooden bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. A delivery truck filled with identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will pass over the bridge. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A train leaves its departure station with 6 coal cars, 12 iron cars, and 2 wood cars. Between each station, there are 6 miles, and it takes 25 minutes to travel between them. At each station, the train can deposit up to 2 coal cars, 3 iron cars, and 1 wood car. How many minutes will it take to deliver all the cars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find the total number of cars the train has: 6 coal cars + 12 iron cars + 2 wood cars = 20 cars Next, let's find the maximum number of cars the train can deposit at each station: 2 coal cars + 3 iron cars + 1 wood car = 6 cars To deliver all 20 cars, the train will need to make multiple trips between stations. For each trip, the train can deposit 6 cars. So, the number of trips the train will need to make is: 20 cars \u00f7 6 cars per trip = 3.33 trips Since the train cannot make a partial trip, it will need to make 4 trips. Each trip takes 25 minutes, so the total time it will take to deliver all the cars is: 4 trips x 25 minutes per trip = 100 minutes The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of 18 watermelons. Since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, the total weight of 18 watermelons would be: 23 x 18 = 414 pounds Next, we need to find the total amount of money Farmer Kent would make by selling these watermelons. Since he sells them for $2 a pound, we can multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 414 x $2 = $828 Therefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Hammond carves life-sized statues out of marble. His latest set of four statues started with an 80-pound block of marble. The first statue he carved weighed 10 pounds. The second statue weighed 18. The remaining two statues weighed the same amount. The marble he discarded after carving it off the statues weighed 22 pounds. How much did each of the remaining statues Hammond carved weigh?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total weight of the first two statues. The first statue weighed 10 pounds and the second statue weighed 18 pounds, so the total weight of the first two statues is 10 + 18 = 28 pounds. Step 2: Find the weight of the discarded marble. The discarded marble weighed 22 pounds. Step 3: Find the weight of the remaining marble. The weight of the remaining marble is the difference between the weight of the original block of marble and the weight of the discarded marble. So, the weight of the remaining marble is 80 - 22 = 58 pounds. Step 4: Find the weight of each of the remaining statues. The remaining two statues weighed the same amount, so we can divide the weight of the remaining marble by 2 to find the weight of each statue. 58 / 2 = 29 pounds. Therefore, each of the remaining statues Hammond carved weighed 29 pounds. The answer is 29.\n\n\nQ: Parker went to the gym and found 4 twenty pounds dumbbells set up for weightlifting. He added two more dumbbells to the setup and started his exercises. How many pounds of dumbbells is Parker using for his exercises?\nA: Let's think step by step. Parker started with 4 twenty pounds dumbbells, which means he was using 4 x 20 = 80 pounds of dumbbells for his exercises. Then he added two more dumbbells, but we don't know how much each of them weighs. Let's call the weight of each new dumbbell \"x\". So now Parker is using a total of (4 + 2) dumbbells, which is 6 dumbbells in total. The weight of each dumbbell is either 20 pounds (the original ones) or x pounds (the new ones). Therefore, the total weight of dumbbells that Parker is using for his exercises is: 80 + 2x We don't know the value of x, so we can't calculate the exact weight. But we do know that it's at least 20 pounds (since the original dumbbells were 20 pounds each). The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: In a shipping container, there are 10 crates. Each crate is filled with 6 boxes and each box is filled with 4 washing machines. A worker removes 1 washing machine from each box. There are no other changes. How many washing machines were removed from the shipping container?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many washing machines are in one crate. Since each crate has 6 boxes and each box has 4 washing machines, we can multiply 6 by 4 to get: 6 x 4 = 24 So, there are 24 washing machines in one crate. Next, we need to find out how many washing machines are in the entire shipping container. Since there are 10 crates, we can multiply 24 by 10 to get: 24 x 10 = 240 So, there are 240 washing machines in the shipping container. Finally, we need to find out how many washing machines were removed. Since one washing machine was removed from each box, and there are 6 boxes in each crate, we can multiply 1 by 6 to get: 1 x 6 = 6 So, 6 washing machines were removed from each crate. To find out how many were removed from the entire shipping container, we can multiply 6 by 10 (the number of crates) to get: 6 x 10 = 60 Therefore, 60 washing machines were removed from the shipping container. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: An airline company owns 5 airplanes. Every airplane they own has 20 rows with 7 seats in each row. Each airplane makes 2 flights a day. How many passengers can the airline company accommodate each day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many seats are in one airplane. We can do this by multiplying the number of rows by the number of seats in each row: 20 rows x 7 seats per row = 140 seats per airplane Next, we need to find out how many passengers can fly on one airplane in a day. Since each airplane makes 2 flights a day, we can multiply the number of seats per airplane by 2: 140 seats per airplane x 2 flights per day = 280 passengers per airplane per day Finally, we need to find out how many passengers the airline company can accommodate in a day with all 5 airplanes: 280 passengers per airplane per day x 5 airplanes = 1,400 passengers per day Therefore, the airline company can accommodate 1,400 passengers each day. The answer is 1400.\n\n\nQ: Adam has just bought some new books so he has decided to clean up his bookcase. After he adds his new books to his bookshelf he realizes that he has bought enough books to finish completely filling his bookcase with 2 books left over. Before his shopping trip, Adam had 56 books in his bookcase. If his bookcase has 4 shelves and averages 20 books per shelf, how many books did Adam buy on his shopping trip?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many books can fit on Adam's bookcase. We know that he has 4 shelves and each shelf can hold an average of 20 books, so the total capacity of his bookcase is: 4 shelves x 20 books per shelf = 80 books Next, we need to figure out how many books Adam had before his shopping trip. We know that he had 56 books in his bookcase before he bought any new books. Now, we can use the information given in the problem to figure out how many books Adam bought on his shopping trip. We know that he bought enough books to completely fill his bookcase with 2 books left over. This means that he bought: 80 books - 2 books left over = 78 books Therefore, Adam bought 78 books on his shopping trip. The answer is 78.\n\n\nQ: Johnny is buying planks of wood to build some tables. Each table needs a plank of wood for each of the legs and 5 planks of wood for the surface. If Johnny wants to build 5 tables, how many planks of wood does he need?\nA: Let's think step by step. Each table needs 4 planks of wood for the legs (assuming it's a standard table with 4 legs). So for 5 tables, Johnny needs 5 x 4 = 20 planks of wood for the legs. Each table also needs 5 planks of wood for the surface, so for 5 tables, Johnny needs 5 x 5 = 25 planks of wood for the surfaces. Therefore, Johnny needs a total of 20 + 25 = 45 planks of wood to build 5 tables. The answer is 5.\n\n\n"
