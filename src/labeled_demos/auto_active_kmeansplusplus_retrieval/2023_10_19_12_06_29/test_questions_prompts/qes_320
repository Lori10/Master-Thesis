  "test_question": "Q: James gets a job selling used cars.  He sold 10 cars that cost $25,000 each.  The company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars.  He got a 10% commission on the profits.  How much did he make?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A factory decides to stop making cars and start making motorcycles instead. When it made cars, per month, it cost $100 for materials, they could make 4 cars, and they sold each car for $50. Now that they make motorcycles it costs $250 for materials, but they sell 8 of them for $50 each. How much more profit do they make per month selling motorcycles instead of cars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the profit made per car: Revenue per car = $50 Cost per car = $100/4 = $25 Profit per car = Revenue per car - Cost per car = $50 - $25 = $25 Now, let's calculate the profit made per motorcycle: Revenue per motorcycle = $50 x 8 = $400 Cost per motorcycle = $250 Profit per motorcycle = Revenue per motorcycle - Cost per motorcycle = $400 - $250 = $150 Finally, let's calculate the difference in profit between making cars and making motorcycles: Profit difference = Profit per motorcycle - Profit per car = $150 - $25 = $125 Therefore, the factory makes $125 more profit per month by making motorcycles instead of cars. The answer is 125.\n\n\nQ: James buys $3000 worth of stuff from Amazon.  He has to return a TV that cost $700 and a bike that cost $500.  He also sells another bike that cost 20% more than the bike he returned for 80% of what he bought it for.  He then buys a toaster for $100.  How much is he out of pocket for everything?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, James spent $3000 on Amazon. Then he returned a TV that cost $700 and a bike that cost $500. So, he spent $3000 - $700 - $500 = $1800. Next, he sold a bike that cost 20% more than the bike he returned. If the returned bike cost $500, then the bike he sold cost 1.2 * $500 = $600. He sold it for 80% of what he bought it for, which is 0.8 * $600 = $480. Now, let's add up all the transactions. James spent $1800 on Amazon, sold a bike for $480, and bought a toaster for $100. So, he is out of pocket for $1800 - $480 + $100 = $1420. Therefore, James is out of pocket for $1420. The answer is 1420.\n\n\nQ: John buys 500 newspapers.  Each newspaper sells for $2.  He sells 80% of them.  He buys them all for 75% less than the price at which he sells them.  How much profit does he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much John buys the newspapers for. He buys them for 75% less than the price at which he sells them, which means he buys them for 25% of the selling price. 25% of the selling price = 0.25 x 2 = $0.50 So, John buys each newspaper for $0.50. Next, let's calculate how much John earns from selling the newspapers. He sells 80% of the 500 newspapers, which is: 0.8 x 500 = 400 newspapers He sells each newspaper for $2, so his total earnings are: 400 x 2 = $800 Now, let's calculate how much John spent on buying the newspapers: 500 x 0.50 = $250 Therefore, John's profit is: $800 - $250 = $550 So, John makes a profit of $550. The answer is 550.\n\n\nQ: Jim buys a wedding ring for $10,000.  He gets his wife a ring that is twice that much and sells the first one for half its value.  How much is he out of pocket?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Jim buys a wedding ring for $10,000. Next, we know that he gets his wife a ring that is twice that much, which means he spends $20,000 on her ring. Now, he sells the first ring for half its value, which means he sells it for $5,000. To find out how much Jim is out of pocket, we need to add up all of his expenses and subtract any income he received from selling the first ring. So, Jim's total expenses are $10,000 + $20,000 = $30,000. His income from selling the first ring is $5,000. Therefore, Jim is out of pocket $30,000 - $5,000 = $25,000. The answer is 25000.\n\n\nQ: James gets paid $0.50/mile to drive a truck carrying hazardous waste. He has to pay $4.00/gallon for gas and his truck gets 20 miles per gallon. How much profit does he make from a 600 mile trip?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how many gallons of gas James will need for the trip. To do this, we divide the total distance by the truck's gas mileage: 600 miles \u00f7 20 miles per gallon = 30 gallons of gas Next, we need to calculate how much James will spend on gas: 30 gallons x $4.00 per gallon = $120.00 Now we can calculate how much James will earn from the trip: 600 miles x $0.50 per mile = $300.00 Finally, we can calculate James' profit by subtracting the cost of gas from his earnings: $300.00 - $120.00 = $180.00 Therefore, James will make a profit of $180.00 from a 600 mile trip. The answer is 600.\n\n\nQ: Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how much money Carl will earn in four weeks. If he earns $0.50 every time, and he buys a candy bar each time, that means he's spending $0.50 each week. But he's also earning $0.75 each week for taking out his neighbor's trash. So his net earnings each week are $0.75 - $0.50 = $0.25. Over four weeks, that's a total of $0.25 x 4 = $1. So Carl will have $1 to spend on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.50, he can buy 2 candy bars with his earnings. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Steve makes 40000$ a year as a teacher.  He loses 20 percent to taxes, 10 percent to healthcare, and 800$ to local union dues.  How much money does Steve take home?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Steve loses to taxes. To do this, we can multiply his salary by the tax rate as a decimal: 20% as a decimal is 0.20 Tax = 40000 x 0.20 = 8000$ Next, we need to find out how much money Steve loses to healthcare. We can use the same method as above: 10% as a decimal is 0.10 Healthcare = 40000 x 0.10 = 4000$ Now we need to subtract the taxes, healthcare, and union dues from Steve's salary to find out how much money he takes home: Take home pay = 40000 - 8000 - 4000 - 800 = 27200$ Therefore, Steve takes home 27200$ after taxes, healthcare, and union dues are deducted from his salary. The answer is 27200.\n\n\nQ: Michael has $42. Michael gives away half the money to his brother. His brother then buys 3 dollars worth of candy. If his brother has $35 left, how much money, in dollars, did his brother have at first?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Michael had $42. Next, he gave away half of that money to his brother, which is $21. His brother then spent $3 on candy, leaving him with $35. To figure out how much money his brother had at first, we need to work backwards. If his brother had $35 after spending $3 on candy, then he had $38 before buying the candy. And if his brother received $21 from Michael, then he must have had $17 to begin with. Therefore, his brother had $17 at first. The answer is 17.\n\n\n"
