  "test_question": "Q: Jamaar loves fresh fruit and is headed to the store with $10 he earned mowing lawns. Including tax, peaches and pears are $.5 each, apples are $.75 each, kiwis are $1, and plums cost $.25 each. If he has already purchased 3 peaches, 4 pears, 2 kiwis, and 5 apples, how many plums can he buy?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Apples used to cost $1.6 per pound.  The price got raised 25%.  How much does it cost to buy 2 pounds of apples for each person in a 4 member family?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Calculate the new price of apples after the 25% increase. The price increase is 25% of $1.6, which is (25/100) x $1.6 = $0.4. So, the new price of apples is $1.6 + $0.4 = $2. Step 2: Calculate the cost of buying 2 pounds of apples for each person in the family. Since there are 4 members in the family, we need to buy 2 x 4 = 8 pounds of apples in total. The cost of buying 1 pound of apples is $2, so the cost of buying 8 pounds of apples is 8 x $2 = $16. Therefore, it would cost $16 to buy 2 pounds of apples for each person in a 4 member family. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of 18 watermelons. Since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, the total weight of 18 watermelons would be: 23 x 18 = 414 pounds Next, we need to find the total amount of money Farmer Kent would make by selling these watermelons. Since he sells them for $2 a pound, we can multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 414 x $2 = $828 Therefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how much money Carl will earn in four weeks. If he earns $0.50 every time, and he buys a candy bar each time, that means he's spending $0.50 each week. But he's also earning $0.75 each week for taking out his neighbor's trash. So his net earnings each week are $0.75 - $0.50 = $0.25. Over four weeks, that's a total of $0.25 x 4 = $1. So Carl will have $1 to spend on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.50, he can buy 2 candy bars with his earnings. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: A gallon of whole milk that normally costs $3 is now sold at $2. A box of cereal was sold at a discount of $1. How much will you save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the discount for each gallon of whole milk. The discount is $3 - $2 = $1 per gallon. So, if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk, you will save 3 x $1 = $3. Next, let's calculate the discount for each box of cereal. The discount is $1 per box. So, if you buy 5 boxes of cereal, you will save 5 x $1 = $5. Therefore, the total amount you will save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal is $3 + $5 = $8. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Michael has $42. Michael gives away half the money to his brother. His brother then buys 3 dollars worth of candy. If his brother has $35 left, how much money, in dollars, did his brother have at first?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Michael had $42. Next, he gave away half of that money to his brother, which is $21. His brother then spent $3 on candy, leaving him with $35. To figure out how much money his brother had at first, we need to work backwards. If his brother had $35 after spending $3 on candy, then he had $38 before buying the candy. And if his brother received $21 from Michael, then he must have had $17 to begin with. Therefore, his brother had $17 at first. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Samuel is going to the cinema with his brother, Kevin. They both have a total budget of $20 for their outing. Samuel buys his $14 ticket, then spends $6 on drinks and food. Kevin buys his ticket, then spends $2 on drinks. They have both used their entire budget. How much did Kevin spend on food?\nA: Let's think step by step. Samuel spent $14 on his ticket and $6 on food and drinks, which means he spent a total of $20. This means that Kevin must have spent $0 on food and drinks, since they both used their entire budget of $20. Therefore, Kevin spent $6 on his ticket and $2 on drinks, which means he spent a total of $8. Since he didn't spend any money on food, the answer is $0. The answer is 0.\n\n\nQ: Five people are planning a party. Sonja will buy a loaf of French bread ($3 a loaf) and a platter of cold cuts ($23). Barbara will buy the soda ($1 per person) and two boxes of crackers ($2 per box). Mario and Rick will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles ($3 per package). Danica will supply a package of paper plates for $4. How much more will Sonja spend than the rest of the office put together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of Barbara's contribution. She will buy soda for 5 people, which will cost $5 (1 dollar per person). She will also buy two boxes of crackers, which will cost $4 (2 dollars per box). Therefore, Barbara's total contribution will be $9. Next, let's calculate the total cost of Mario and Rick's contribution. They will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles, which will cost $6 in total (3 dollars per package). Now, let's add up the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's. Barbara's contribution is $9, Mario and Rick's contribution is $6, and Danica's contribution is $4. Therefore, the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's is $19. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of Sonja's contribution. She will buy a loaf of French bread for $3 and a platter of cold cuts for $23. Therefore, Sonja's total contribution will be $26. To find out how much more Sonja will spend than the rest of the office put together, we need to subtract the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's from Sonja's total contribution. $26 (Sonja's contribution) - $19 (total cost of everyone else's contribution) = $7 Therefore, Sonja will spend $7 more than the rest of the office put together. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Jeremy buys 30 watermelons. He eats 3 watermelons per week. Each week he gives 2 to his dad. How many weeks will the watermelons last?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many watermelons Jeremy eats per week and how many he gives to his dad. Jeremy eats 3 watermelons per week and gives 2 to his dad, so he uses a total of 5 watermelons per week. Next, we need to divide the total number of watermelons by the number of watermelons used per week to find out how many weeks the watermelons will last. 30 watermelons \u00f7 5 watermelons per week = 6 weeks Therefore, the watermelons will last for 6 weeks. The answer is 6.\n\n\n"
