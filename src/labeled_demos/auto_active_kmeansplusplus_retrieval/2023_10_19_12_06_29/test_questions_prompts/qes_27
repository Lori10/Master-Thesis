  "test_question": "Q: Dale is selling butterscotch candies to raise money for his club at school. He doesn't have the candies yet and is instead just taking orders. He started off with 100 total that he ordered and wanted to sell, but he ended up selling 150 butterscotch candies. Then he ordered 100 more.

  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Carl has a goal of selling 96 cupcakes in 2 days. Carl needs to give 24 cupcakes to Bonnie as payment for using her storefront. How many cupcakes must Carl sell per day to reach his goal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to subtract the 24 cupcakes that Carl needs to give to Bonnie from his goal of selling 96 cupcakes. 96 - 24 = 72 So Carl needs to sell 72 cupcakes in 2 days. To find out how many cupcakes he needs to sell per day, we can divide 72 by 2: 72 \u00f7 2 = 36 Therefore, Carl needs to sell 36 cupcakes per day to reach his goal of selling 96 cupcakes in 2 days, after giving 24 cupcakes to Bonnie. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how much money Carl will earn in four weeks. If he earns $0.50 every time, and he buys a candy bar each time, that means he's spending $0.50 each week. But he's also earning $0.75 each week for taking out his neighbor's trash. So his net earnings each week are $0.75 - $0.50 = $0.25. Over four weeks, that's a total of $0.25 x 4 = $1. So Carl will have $1 to spend on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.50, he can buy 2 candy bars with his earnings. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Michael has $42. Michael gives away half the money to his brother. His brother then buys 3 dollars worth of candy. If his brother has $35 left, how much money, in dollars, did his brother have at first?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Michael had $42. Next, he gave away half of that money to his brother, which is $21. His brother then spent $3 on candy, leaving him with $35. To figure out how much money his brother had at first, we need to work backwards. If his brother had $35 after spending $3 on candy, then he had $38 before buying the candy. And if his brother received $21 from Michael, then he must have had $17 to begin with. Therefore, his brother had $17 at first. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Dani brings two and half dozen cupcakes for her 2nd-grade class.  There are 27 students (including Dani), 1 teacher, and 1 teacher\u2019s aid.  If 3 students called in sick that day, how many cupcakes are left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Dani brought in total. Two and a half dozen cupcakes is equal to 30 cupcakes (since a dozen is 12). Next, we need to figure out how many people will be receiving cupcakes. There are 27 students, 1 teacher, and 1 teacher's aid, for a total of 29 people. However, 3 students called in sick, so we need to subtract them from the total. 29 - 3 = 26 people receiving cupcakes. Now, we need to subtract 26 cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes Dani brought. 30 - 26 = 4 cupcakes left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Mary wants 144 cupcakes for her party. Mary has already made 36 cherry cupcakes, and 48 berry cupcakes. Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes for the rest. How much of each should she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Mary has already made: 36 cherry + 48 berry = 84 cupcakes Next, we need to figure out how many more cupcakes Mary needs to make: 144 total cupcakes - 84 cupcakes already made = 60 cupcakes Since Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, we can divide the remaining 60 cupcakes by 2: 60 cupcakes \u00f7 2 = 30 cupcakes of each flavor Therefore, Mary should make 30 chocolate cupcakes and 30 vanilla cupcakes to have a total of 144 cupcakes for her party. The answer is 144.\n\n\nQ: Shelby was having a movie party for her birthday. She and her mom made a dozen bags of buttered popcorn and 10 bags of caramel popcorn. Her brother Alan took 3 bags of buttered popcorn and 1 bag of caramel popcorn for his friends. How many bags of popcorn does Shelby have left for the party?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine how many bags of popcorn Shelby had before her brother took some. Shelby had a dozen bags of buttered popcorn, which is equal to 12. She also had 10 bags of caramel popcorn. So, in total, she had 12 + 10 = 22 bags of popcorn. Next, we need to subtract the bags of popcorn that Alan took. Alan took 3 bags of buttered popcorn and 1 bag of caramel popcorn, which is a total of 4 bags. So, Shelby is left with 22 - 4 = 18 bags of popcorn for the party. Therefore, Shelby has 18 bags of popcorn left for the party. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: At Penny\u2019s bakery, her famous blueberry cheesecakes are $7 a slice.  Each cheesecake pie is cut into 6 thick slices.  If she sells 7 cheesecake pies, how much money does she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of cheesecake Penny has in total. Since each cheesecake pie is cut into 6 slices, we can multiply 6 by the number of cheesecake pies she sold: 6 slices/pie x 7 pies = 42 slices So Penny sold 42 slices of blueberry cheesecake. Next, we need to find out how much money she made from selling those 42 slices. Each slice costs $7, so we can multiply 7 by the number of slices: $7/slice x 42 slices = $294 Therefore, Penny made $294 from selling 7 cheesecake pies. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: A flower shop sells bouquets of roses, which each contain 12 roses, and bouquets of daisies, which each contain an equal amount of daisies. The flower shop sells 20 bouquets today. 10 of these were rose bouquets and the remaining 10 bouquets were daisy bouquets. If the flower shop has sold 190 flowers in total today, how many daisies are in each bouquet of daisies?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the flower shop sold 10 bouquets of roses, each containing 12 roses, so they sold a total of 10 x 12 = 120 roses. Next, we know that the flower shop sold 10 bouquets of daisies, and we want to find out how many daisies are in each bouquet. Let's call the number of daisies in each bouquet \"d\". So, the flower shop sold a total of 10 x d = 10d daisies. We also know that the flower shop sold a total of 190 flowers in total today, so: 120 (roses) + 10d (daisies) = 190 Simplifying this equation, we get: 10d = 70 Dividing both sides by 10, we get: d = 7 Therefore, each bouquet of daisies contains 7 daisies. The answer is 7.\n\n\n"
