  "test_question": "Q: John drives to his friend's house 200 miles away.  He drives at a speed of 70 mph.  He had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip.  After he gets there he takes a route home that is 240 miles but he goes 80 mph.  How long did the trip take?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A car driving cross-country traveled 180 miles in 4 hours. At this rate of speed, how many miles further will the car travel in the next 3 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the car's speed in miles per hour (mph). To do this, we divide the distance traveled by the time taken: Speed = Distance \u00f7 Time Speed = 180 miles \u00f7 4 hours Speed = 45 mph Now that we know the car's speed, we can use it to calculate how far it will travel in the next 3 hours: Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time Distance = 45 mph \u00d7 3 hours Distance = 135 miles Therefore, the car will travel 135 miles further in the next 3 hours. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Emery's family decides to travel for a weekend trip. They drive the first 100 miles in 1 hour. They stop at a McDonald's and then continue the rest of the journey for 300 miles. What's the total number of hours they traveled?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, they drove 100 miles in 1 hour. Then, they stopped at McDonald's, which we don't know how long it took. Finally, they continued the rest of the journey for 300 miles. So, the total distance they traveled is 100 + 300 = 400 miles. We know they drove the first 100 miles in 1 hour, but we don't know how long they stopped at McDonald's. Let's call that time \"x\". Then, they drove the remaining 300 miles. Let's call the time it took to drive that distance \"y\". So, the total time they traveled is: 1 hour (for the first 100 miles) + x (for the time they stopped at McDonald's) + y (for the remaining 300 miles) We don't know x or y, but we do know that the total time they traveled is the sum of those three values. Therefore, the answer is: Total time = 1 + x + y hours. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Jessica just got her driving permit. She must complete 50 hours of driving with a parent to get her driver\u2019s license. It takes 20 minutes to drive to school. If she drives to and from school every day, how many school days will it take Jessica to meet the 50-hour driving requirement?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much time Jessica spends driving to and from school each day. She drives to school and back, so that's a total of 2 trips. Each trip takes 20 minutes, so she spends 40 minutes driving to and from school each day. Next, we need to figure out how many minutes of driving Jessica needs to complete in order to reach the 50-hour requirement. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 50 hours is equal to 50 x 60 = 3000 minutes. Now we can divide the total minutes of driving required by the number of minutes Jessica spends driving each day: 3000 / 40 = 75. So Jessica needs to drive for 75 school days in order to complete the 50-hour driving requirement. The answer is 50.\n\n\nQ: James gets paid $0.50/mile to drive a truck carrying hazardous waste. He has to pay $4.00/gallon for gas and his truck gets 20 miles per gallon. How much profit does he make from a 600 mile trip?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how many gallons of gas James will need for the trip. To do this, we divide the total distance by the truck's gas mileage: 600 miles \u00f7 20 miles per gallon = 30 gallons of gas Next, we need to calculate how much James will spend on gas: 30 gallons x $4.00 per gallon = $120.00 Now we can calculate how much James will earn from the trip: 600 miles x $0.50 per mile = $300.00 Finally, we can calculate James' profit by subtracting the cost of gas from his earnings: $300.00 - $120.00 = $180.00 Therefore, James will make a profit of $180.00 from a 600 mile trip. The answer is 600.\n\n\nQ: Talia is playing football with her friends. The park they're playing at is 5 miles from Talia's house. After their game, Talia is planning to go to the grocery store 3 miles away from the park and 8 miles from her home. Starting and ending at Talia's house, how many miles does Talia drive that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Talia drives 5 miles from her house to the park. Then, she drives 3 miles from the park to the grocery store. Finally, she drives 8 miles from the grocery store back to her house. To find the total distance Talia drives that day, we can add up these three distances: 5 miles + 3 miles + 8 miles = 16 miles Therefore, Talia drives a total of 16 miles that day. The answer is 16.\n\n\nQ: Briar is attending a one-week community empowerment event and has to take a cab ride to the event and back home every day. A cab ride costs $2.5 per mile. If the event is 200 miles away from Briar's home, calculate the total amount of money the cab rides cost would be at the end of the event?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total distance Briar will travel during the event. Since Briar has to travel to the event and back home every day, the total distance he will travel in a day is 2 times the distance between his home and the event, which is 2*200 = 400 miles. Next, we need to calculate the total distance Briar will travel during the entire event, which is 400 miles per day multiplied by the number of days in the event. If the event is one week long, then the number of days is 7. Therefore, the total distance Briar will travel during the event is 400*7 = 2800 miles. Finally, we can calculate the total cost of the cab rides by multiplying the total distance by the cost per mile. The cost per mile is $2.5, so the total cost of the cab rides is 2800*$2.5 = $7000. Therefore, the total amount of money the cab rides cost would be at the end of the event is $7000. The answer is 7000.\n\n\nQ: Some friends went hiking for 3.5 hours. They traveled 21 kilometers in that time. Birgit was 4 minutes/km faster than the average time. If Birgit kept the same pace, how many minutes would it take her to go 8 kilometers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the average speed of the group. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken: Average speed = distance/time = 21 km/3.5 hours = 6 km/hour Next, we need to find Birgit's speed. We know that she was 4 minutes/km faster than the average time, which means she completed each kilometer in (60-4) = 56 minutes. So her speed was: Birgit's speed = 1 km/56 minutes = 0.018 km/minute Finally, we need to find how long it would take Birgit to travel 8 kilometers at this speed. We can use the formula: Time = distance/speed Time = 8 km / 0.018 km/minute = 444.44 minutes So it would take Birgit approximately 444.44 minutes to travel 8 kilometers at the same pace. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Carson runs a carpool for five of his friends. The five of them cover all the gas expenses to compensate Carson for his time. Their total commute is 21 miles one way, gas costs $2.50/gallon, Carson's car gets 30 miles/gallon, and they commute to work 5 days a week, 4 weeks a month. How much does each person pay toward gas monthly?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per day. Since they commute 21 miles one way, their round trip is 21 x 2 = 42 miles. Next, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per week. They commute 42 miles per day, and they commute 5 days a week, so they commute 42 x 5 = 210 miles per week. Then, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per month. They commute 210 miles per week, and they commute 4 weeks a month, so they commute 210 x 4 = 840 miles per month. Now, we need to find out how many gallons of gas they need per month. Carson's car gets 30 miles per gallon, and they commute 840 miles per month, so they need 840/30 = 28 gallons of gas per month. Finally, we need to find out how much each person pays toward gas monthly. The total cost of gas is $2.50 per gallon, and they need 28 gallons of gas per month, so the total cost of gas is 2.5 x 28 = $70 per month. Since there are 6 people in the carpool (Carson and his 5 friends), each person pays 70/6 = $11.67 toward gas monthly. The answer is 12.\n\n\n"
