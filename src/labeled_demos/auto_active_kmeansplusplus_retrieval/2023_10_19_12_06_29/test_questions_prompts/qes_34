  "test_question": "Q: John cuts down an 80-foot tree.  He can make logs out of 80% of it. He cuts it into 4-foot logs.  From each of those logs, he cuts 5 planks.  He then sells each plank for $1.2.  How much does he make?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Johnny is buying planks of wood to build some tables. Each table needs a plank of wood for each of the legs and 5 planks of wood for the surface. If Johnny wants to build 5 tables, how many planks of wood does he need?\nA: Let's think step by step. Each table needs 4 planks of wood for the legs (assuming it's a standard table with 4 legs). So for 5 tables, Johnny needs 5 x 4 = 20 planks of wood for the legs. Each table also needs 5 planks of wood for the surface, so for 5 tables, Johnny needs 5 x 5 = 25 planks of wood for the surfaces. Therefore, Johnny needs a total of 20 + 25 = 45 planks of wood to build 5 tables. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: John buys 500 newspapers.  Each newspaper sells for $2.  He sells 80% of them.  He buys them all for 75% less than the price at which he sells them.  How much profit does he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much John buys the newspapers for. He buys them for 75% less than the price at which he sells them, which means he buys them for 25% of the selling price. 25% of the selling price = 0.25 x 2 = $0.50 So, John buys each newspaper for $0.50. Next, let's calculate how much John earns from selling the newspapers. He sells 80% of the 500 newspapers, which is: 0.8 x 500 = 400 newspapers He sells each newspaper for $2, so his total earnings are: 400 x 2 = $800 Now, let's calculate how much John spent on buying the newspapers: 500 x 0.50 = $250 Therefore, John's profit is: $800 - $250 = $550 So, John makes a profit of $550. The answer is 550.\n\n\nQ: Mitch has saved $20000 to finance his boating hobby. A new boat costs $1500 per foot in length. If Mitch needs to keep $500 for a license and registration, and three times that amount for docking fees, how many feet is the longest boat he can buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to subtract the amount Mitch needs to keep for license and registration and docking fees from his total savings: $20,000 - $500 - (3 x $500) = $18,500 Next, we need to divide this amount by the cost per foot of the boat: $18,500 \u00f7 $1500/ft = 12.33 ft Since we can't buy a fraction of a foot, we need to round down to the nearest whole number: The longest boat Mitch can buy is 12 feet long. The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: John is performing in 3 plays.  Each play has 5 Acts.  He wears 2 wigs per act.  Each wig cost $5.  He drops one of the plays and sells all of the wigs for that play for $4.  How much money did he spend?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many wigs John needs in total. Since he performs in 3 plays and each play has 5 acts, he needs 3 x 5 = 15 wigs in total. Next, we need to find out how much he spent on all the wigs. Since he wears 2 wigs per act, he needs 2 x 15 = 30 wigs in total. Each wig costs $5, so he spent 30 x $5 = $150 on all the wigs. Now, we need to find out how much money he made by selling the wigs from one of the plays. He sold all the wigs for $4 each, so he made 15 x $4 = $60. Finally, we need to subtract the money he made from the money he spent to find out how much money he spent in total. $150 - $60 = $90. Therefore, John spent $90 on all the wigs. The answer is 90.\n\n\nQ: James wants to build a ladder to climb a very tall tree.  Each rung of the ladder is 18 inches long and they are 6 inches apart.  If he needs to climb 50 feet how many feet of wood will he need for the rungs?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 50 feet to inches since the length of the rungs is given in inches. 50 feet = 600 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches) Next, we need to figure out how many rungs James will need. We know that each rung is 18 inches long and they are 6 inches apart. So, the total length of each \"rung + gap\" is 24 inches. To find the number of rungs, we can divide the total height of the ladder (600 inches) by the length of each \"rung + gap\" (24 inches). 600 inches \u00f7 24 inches = 25 rungs Finally, we can calculate the total length of wood needed for the rungs by multiplying the length of each rung (18 inches) by the number of rungs (25). 18 inches x 25 rungs = 450 inches To convert this back to feet, we divide by 12: 450 inches \u00f7 12 inches/foot = 37.5 feet So James will need 37.5 feet of wood for the rungs of his ladder. The answer is 38.\n\n\nQ: Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how much money Carl will earn in four weeks. If he earns $0.50 every time, and he buys a candy bar each time, that means he's spending $0.50 each week. But he's also earning $0.75 each week for taking out his neighbor's trash. So his net earnings each week are $0.75 - $0.50 = $0.25. Over four weeks, that's a total of $0.25 x 4 = $1. So Carl will have $1 to spend on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.50, he can buy 2 candy bars with his earnings. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: John buys game loot boxes for $5 each.  The average value of items inside is $3.5.   He spends $40 on loot boxes.  What is the average amount he lost?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many loot boxes John bought. We can do this by dividing the total amount he spent by the cost of each loot box: 40 / 5 = 8 So John bought 8 loot boxes. Next, we need to find out the total value of the items inside all the loot boxes. We can do this by multiplying the average value of each box by the number of boxes: 3.5 x 8 = 28 So the total value of the items inside all the loot boxes is $28. Finally, we can find out the average amount John lost by subtracting the total value of the items from the total amount he spent: 40 - 28 = 12 So John lost an average of $12 on each loot box. The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: James gets paid $0.50/mile to drive a truck carrying hazardous waste. He has to pay $4.00/gallon for gas and his truck gets 20 miles per gallon. How much profit does he make from a 600 mile trip?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how many gallons of gas James will need for the trip. To do this, we divide the total distance by the truck's gas mileage: 600 miles \u00f7 20 miles per gallon = 30 gallons of gas Next, we need to calculate how much James will spend on gas: 30 gallons x $4.00 per gallon = $120.00 Now we can calculate how much James will earn from the trip: 600 miles x $0.50 per mile = $300.00 Finally, we can calculate James' profit by subtracting the cost of gas from his earnings: $300.00 - $120.00 = $180.00 Therefore, James will make a profit of $180.00 from a 600 mile trip. The answer is 600.\n\n\n"
