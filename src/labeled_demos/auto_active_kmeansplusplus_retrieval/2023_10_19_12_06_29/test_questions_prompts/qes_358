  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Lorie has 2 pieces of $100 bills. He requested to change one piece of the $100 bills into $50 bills. Half of the remaining $100 bill is changed to $10 bills while the rest is changed to $5 bills. How many pieces of bills will she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Lorie has 2 pieces of $100 bills, which means she has a total of $200. Next, she changes one piece of the $100 bill into $50 bills. One piece of $100 bill is equal to 2 pieces of $50 bills, so she now has a total of $200 - $100 + $100 = $200. Half of the remaining $100 bill is changed to $10 bills. Half of $100 is $50, so she changes $50 into $10 bills. $50 divided by $10 is 5, so she now has 5 pieces of $10 bills. The rest of the remaining $100 bill is changed to $5 bills. The remaining amount is $50, and $50 divided by $5 is 10, so she now has 10 pieces of $5 bills. Therefore, Lorie now has a total of 2 pieces of $50 bills, 5 pieces of $10 bills, and 10 pieces of $5 bills, which is a total of 17 pieces of bills. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Michael has $42. Michael gives away half the money to his brother. His brother then buys 3 dollars worth of candy. If his brother has $35 left, how much money, in dollars, did his brother have at first?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Michael had $42. Next, he gave away half of that money to his brother, which is $21. His brother then spent $3 on candy, leaving him with $35. To figure out how much money his brother had at first, we need to work backwards. If his brother had $35 after spending $3 on candy, then he had $38 before buying the candy. And if his brother received $21 from Michael, then he must have had $17 to begin with. Therefore, his brother had $17 at first. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Marco has $24. Mary has $15. If Marco gives Mary half of what he has, Mary will have more than Marco. But Mary spends $5. How much more money does Mary have than Marco?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much money Marco gives to Mary. Since Marco has $24, half of that would be $12. So, Marco gives $12 to Mary. After receiving $12 from Marco, Mary will have $15 + $12 = $27. However, Mary spends $5, so we need to subtract that from her total. $27 - $5 = $22. Therefore, Mary has $22 more than Marco. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Bertha started with two balls and gave one to her partner, so she has one ball left. Next, we need to figure out how many balls she loses and how many wear out. In 20 games, she loses 20/5 = 4 balls and 20/10 = 2 balls wear out. Finally, we need to figure out how many balls she buys. In 20 games, she buys 20/4 = 5 canisters of three balls, which is a total of 5*3 = 15 balls. So, in total, Bertha has 1 (starting ball) - 4 (lost balls) - 2 (worn out balls) + 15 (bought balls) = 10 tennis balls. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: John buys 500 newspapers.  Each newspaper sells for $2.  He sells 80% of them.  He buys them all for 75% less than the price at which he sells them.  How much profit does he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much John buys the newspapers for. He buys them for 75% less than the price at which he sells them, which means he buys them for 25% of the selling price. 25% of the selling price = 0.25 x 2 = $0.50 So, John buys each newspaper for $0.50. Next, let's calculate how much John earns from selling the newspapers. He sells 80% of the 500 newspapers, which is: 0.8 x 500 = 400 newspapers He sells each newspaper for $2, so his total earnings are: 400 x 2 = $800 Now, let's calculate how much John spent on buying the newspapers: 500 x 0.50 = $250 Therefore, John's profit is: $800 - $250 = $550 So, John makes a profit of $550. The answer is 550.\n\n\nQ: Steve makes 40000$ a year as a teacher.  He loses 20 percent to taxes, 10 percent to healthcare, and 800$ to local union dues.  How much money does Steve take home?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Steve loses to taxes. To do this, we can multiply his salary by the tax rate as a decimal: 20% as a decimal is 0.20 Tax = 40000 x 0.20 = 8000$ Next, we need to find out how much money Steve loses to healthcare. We can use the same method as above: 10% as a decimal is 0.10 Healthcare = 40000 x 0.10 = 4000$ Now we need to subtract the taxes, healthcare, and union dues from Steve's salary to find out how much money he takes home: Take home pay = 40000 - 8000 - 4000 - 800 = 27200$ Therefore, Steve takes home 27200$ after taxes, healthcare, and union dues are deducted from his salary. The answer is 27200.\n\n\nQ: John buys game loot boxes for $5 each.  The average value of items inside is $3.5.   He spends $40 on loot boxes.  What is the average amount he lost?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many loot boxes John bought. We can do this by dividing the total amount he spent by the cost of each loot box: 40 / 5 = 8 So John bought 8 loot boxes. Next, we need to find out the total value of the items inside all the loot boxes. We can do this by multiplying the average value of each box by the number of boxes: 3.5 x 8 = 28 So the total value of the items inside all the loot boxes is $28. Finally, we can find out the average amount John lost by subtracting the total value of the items from the total amount he spent: 40 - 28 = 12 So John lost an average of $12 on each loot box. The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how much money Carl will earn in four weeks. If he earns $0.50 every time, and he buys a candy bar each time, that means he's spending $0.50 each week. But he's also earning $0.75 each week for taking out his neighbor's trash. So his net earnings each week are $0.75 - $0.50 = $0.25. Over four weeks, that's a total of $0.25 x 4 = $1. So Carl will have $1 to spend on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.50, he can buy 2 candy bars with his earnings. The answer is 2.\n\n\n"
