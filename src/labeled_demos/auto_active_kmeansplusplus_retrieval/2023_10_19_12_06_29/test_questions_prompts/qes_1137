  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A car driving cross-country traveled 180 miles in 4 hours. At this rate of speed, how many miles further will the car travel in the next 3 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the car's speed in miles per hour (mph). To do this, we divide the distance traveled by the time taken: Speed = Distance \u00f7 Time Speed = 180 miles \u00f7 4 hours Speed = 45 mph Now that we know the car's speed, we can use it to calculate how far it will travel in the next 3 hours: Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time Distance = 45 mph \u00d7 3 hours Distance = 135 miles Therefore, the car will travel 135 miles further in the next 3 hours. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Ayla has a customer care job whose primary role is to hear complaints from customers and advise them on the best way to solve their problems. She talks with each customer for a limited amount of time, and each phone call is charged five cents per minute. If each call lasts 1 hour, what's the phone bill at the end of the month if she manages to talk to 50 customers a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many minutes are in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, each call lasts 60 minutes. Next, we need to find out how many minutes Ayla spends on the phone each week. If she talks to 50 customers a week, and each call lasts 60 minutes, then she spends 50 x 60 = 3000 minutes on the phone each week. Now we can calculate the cost of the phone bill. Each minute costs five cents, so 3000 minutes will cost 3000 x $0.05 = $150. Therefore, the phone bill at the end of the month will be $150 x 4 = $600 if Ayla manages to talk to 50 customers a week. The answer is 50.\n\n\nQ: A factory uses robots to manufacture batteries. For each battery that is made, it takes a robot 6 minutes to gather the materials for the battery and 9 minutes to create the battery. If the factory has 10 robots working on batteries at the same time, how many batteries can the robots manufacture in 5 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 5 hours to minutes. 5 hours = 5 x 60 = 300 minutes Next, we need to find out how long it takes for one robot to make one battery. 6 minutes to gather materials + 9 minutes to create battery = 15 minutes per battery Now we can calculate how many batteries one robot can make in 300 minutes. 300 minutes \u00f7 15 minutes per battery = 20 batteries Finally, we can multiply the number of batteries one robot can make by the number of robots working. 20 batteries per robot x 10 robots = 200 batteries Therefore, the robots can manufacture 200 batteries in 5 hours. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Jill spends time every day talking to her boyfriend on the phone.  The first day of the week she spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend.  Each of the following days she spends twice as much time talking on the phone as the day before. After the 5th day her parents take the phone away from her because she was on it too long.  How much time did Jill spend talking to her boyfriend that week?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Jill spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend. On the second day, she spends twice as much time as the first day, which is 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 minutes. On the third day, she spends twice as much time as the second day, which is 2*10=<<2*10=20>>20 minutes. On the fourth day, she spends twice as much time as the third day, which is 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 minutes. On the fifth day, she spends twice as much time as the fourth day, which is 2*40=<<2*40=80>>80 minutes. Therefore, Jill spends a total of 5+10+20+40+80=<<5+10+20+40+80=155>>155 minutes talking to her boyfriend that week. The answer is 155.\n\n\nQ: Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour. Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour.  Oliver can read 40 pages.  How many pages can Carter read in 1 hour?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Oliver can read 40 pages in 1 hour. Next, we know that Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour, so Lucy can read 40 + 20 = 60 pages in 1 hour. Finally, we know that Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour, so Carter can read 60 / 2 = 30 pages in 1 hour. Therefore, Carter can read 30 pages in 1 hour. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: When it rains, the three holes in the garage roof leak water at different rates.  The largest hole leaks at a rate of 3 ounces of water  per minute.  The medium-sized hole leaks water at one-half the rate of the largest hole.  And the smallest hole leaks water at a rate of one-third the rate of the medium-sized hole.  When it rains, what is the combined amount of water, in ounces, that leak from all three holes over a 2-hour time period?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the rate at which the medium-sized hole leaks water. We know that it leaks at one-half the rate of the largest hole, which is 3 ounces per minute. So, the medium-sized hole leaks at a rate of 3/2 = 1.5 ounces per minute. Next, we need to find the rate at which the smallest hole leaks water. We know that it leaks at a rate of one-third the rate of the medium-sized hole, which is 1.5/3 = 0.5 ounces per minute. Now, we can find the total amount of water that leaks from all three holes in one minute. We add up the rates of all three holes: 3 + 1.5 + 0.5 = 5 ounces per minute. Finally, we can find the total amount of water that leaks from all three holes over a 2-hour time period (which is 120 minutes). We multiply the total rate by the time: 5 x 120 = 600 ounces. Therefore, the combined amount of water that leaks from all three holes over a 2-hour time period is 600 ounces. The answer is 600.\n\n\nQ: Some friends went hiking for 3.5 hours. They traveled 21 kilometers in that time. Birgit was 4 minutes/km faster than the average time. If Birgit kept the same pace, how many minutes would it take her to go 8 kilometers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the average speed of the group. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken: Average speed = distance/time = 21 km/3.5 hours = 6 km/hour Next, we need to find Birgit's speed. We know that she was 4 minutes/km faster than the average time, which means she completed each kilometer in (60-4) = 56 minutes. So her speed was: Birgit's speed = 1 km/56 minutes = 0.018 km/minute Finally, we need to find how long it would take Birgit to travel 8 kilometers at this speed. We can use the formula: Time = distance/speed Time = 8 km / 0.018 km/minute = 444.44 minutes So it would take Birgit approximately 444.44 minutes to travel 8 kilometers at the same pace. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: John can play 200 beats per minute.  If he plays 2 hours a day for 3 days how many beats does he play?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many minutes John plays in total. Since he plays for 2 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, he plays for 2 x 60 = 120 minutes per day. Therefore, over 3 days, he plays for a total of 120 x 3 = 360 minutes. Now we need to find out how many beats he plays in total. If he plays 200 beats per minute, then in 360 minutes he plays 200 x 360 = 72,000 beats. So John plays 72,000 beats over the course of 3 days. The answer is 3.\n\n\n"
