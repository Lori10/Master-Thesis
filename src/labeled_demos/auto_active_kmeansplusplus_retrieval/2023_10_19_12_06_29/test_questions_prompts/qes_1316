  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Ayla has a customer care job whose primary role is to hear complaints from customers and advise them on the best way to solve their problems. She talks with each customer for a limited amount of time, and each phone call is charged five cents per minute. If each call lasts 1 hour, what's the phone bill at the end of the month if she manages to talk to 50 customers a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many minutes are in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, each call lasts 60 minutes. Next, we need to find out how many minutes Ayla spends on the phone each week. If she talks to 50 customers a week, and each call lasts 60 minutes, then she spends 50 x 60 = 3000 minutes on the phone each week. Now we can calculate the cost of the phone bill. Each minute costs five cents, so 3000 minutes will cost 3000 x $0.05 = $150. Therefore, the phone bill at the end of the month will be $150 x 4 = $600 if Ayla manages to talk to 50 customers a week. The answer is 50.\n\n\nQ: John adopts a dog from a shelter.  The dog ends up having health problems and this requires 3 vet appointments,  which cost $400 each.  After the first appointment, John paid $100 for pet insurance that covers 80% of the subsequent visits.  How much did he pay in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, John paid $400 for the first vet appointment. Then, he paid $100 for pet insurance that covers 80% of the subsequent visits. This means that for the next two vet appointments, he will only have to pay 20% of the cost. So for the second and third vet appointments, John will pay: 20% of $400 = $80 Therefore, the total cost for the three vet appointments will be: $400 (first appointment) + $80 (second appointment) + $80 (third appointment) = $560 So John paid a total of $560 for the three vet appointments. The answer is 560.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: Doris earns $20 per hour by babysitting. She needs to earn at least $1200 for her monthly expenses. She can babysit for 3 hours every weekday and 5 hours on a Saturday.  How many weeks does it take for Doris to earn enough to cover her monthly expenses?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much Doris earns per week by babysitting. She babysits for 3 hours every weekday, which is a total of 15 hours per week (3 hours x 5 days). She also babysits for 5 hours on a Saturday, which adds another 5 hours to her weekly total. So, in total, she babysits for 20 hours per week. If she earns $20 per hour, then she earns 20 x 20 = $400 per week. To cover her monthly expenses of $1200, she needs to earn 1200 / 400 = 3 weeks of babysitting. Therefore, it takes Doris 3 weeks to earn enough to cover her monthly expenses. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: A factory decides to stop making cars and start making motorcycles instead. When it made cars, per month, it cost $100 for materials, they could make 4 cars, and they sold each car for $50. Now that they make motorcycles it costs $250 for materials, but they sell 8 of them for $50 each. How much more profit do they make per month selling motorcycles instead of cars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the profit made per car: Revenue per car = $50 Cost per car = $100/4 = $25 Profit per car = Revenue per car - Cost per car = $50 - $25 = $25 Now, let's calculate the profit made per motorcycle: Revenue per motorcycle = $50 x 8 = $400 Cost per motorcycle = $250 Profit per motorcycle = Revenue per motorcycle - Cost per motorcycle = $400 - $250 = $150 Finally, let's calculate the difference in profit between making cars and making motorcycles: Profit difference = Profit per motorcycle - Profit per car = $150 - $25 = $125 Therefore, the factory makes $125 more profit per month by making motorcycles instead of cars. The answer is 125.\n\n\nQ: Jamie and Oliver are planning to go on a vacation. A plane ticket costs $24 for each person and a hotel stay costs $12 for each person per day. How much money will they spend on the vacation if they stay for 3 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets for both Jamie and Oliver. Since each ticket costs $24, the total cost of the tickets will be: $24 x 2 = $48 Next, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel stay. Since the cost is $12 per person per day, and they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel stay will be: $12 x 2 x 3 = $72 Finally, we need to add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay to get the total cost of the vacation: $48 + $72 = $120 Therefore, Jamie and Oliver will spend $120 on their vacation. The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: Jenny signs up for dinner theater with 5 of her friends. Each person pays $50 for the ticket and $10 for their entr\u00e9e, and half the people also buy unlimited drink tickets for $30/person. Then the dinner theater is canceled due to COVID, and each person gets a 90% refund. How much money did the group of six friends lose?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total cost per person. Each person pays $50 for the ticket and $10 for their entr\u00e9e, so the total cost per person is $50 + $10 = $60. Half of the people also buy unlimited drink tickets for $30/person, so three people buy drink tickets. The total cost per person for those who bought drink tickets is $60 + $30 = $90. Now we can calculate the total cost for the group of six friends. Since there are three people who bought drink tickets and three who didn't, we can calculate the total cost as follows: Total cost = (3 people x $90/person) + (3 people x $60/person) Total cost = $270 + $180 Total cost = $450 However, the dinner theater was canceled due to COVID, and each person gets a 90% refund. Therefore, the group of six friends will only get back 90% of the total cost, which is: Refund = 90% x $450 Refund = $405 Therefore, the group of six friends lost $450 - $405 = $45 in total. The answer is 45.\n\n\nQ: John buys 500 newspapers.  Each newspaper sells for $2.  He sells 80% of them.  He buys them all for 75% less than the price at which he sells them.  How much profit does he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much John buys the newspapers for. He buys them for 75% less than the price at which he sells them, which means he buys them for 25% of the selling price. 25% of the selling price = 0.25 x 2 = $0.50 So, John buys each newspaper for $0.50. Next, let's calculate how much John earns from selling the newspapers. He sells 80% of the 500 newspapers, which is: 0.8 x 500 = 400 newspapers He sells each newspaper for $2, so his total earnings are: 400 x 2 = $800 Now, let's calculate how much John spent on buying the newspapers: 500 x 0.50 = $250 Therefore, John's profit is: $800 - $250 = $550 So, John makes a profit of $550. The answer is 550.\n\n\n"
