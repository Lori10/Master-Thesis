  "test_question": "Q: Shannon makes herself iced coffee by brewing hot coffee and adding ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees but makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Any added liquid also weakens the coffee. How many milliliters weaker is Shannon\u2019s iced coffee when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Maddie wants to see how much her mom spends on coffee each week. She makes herself 2 cups of coffee per day. Each cup has 1.5 ounces of coffee beans. A bag of coffee costs $8 and contains 10.5 ounces of beans. She uses 1/2 a gallon of milk per week. A gallon of milk costs $4. She doesn't add any sugar to the coffee. How much does she spend on her coffee per week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many ounces of coffee beans Maddie uses per week. She makes 2 cups of coffee per day, so that's 2 x 7 = 14 cups per week. Each cup has 1.5 ounces of coffee beans, so she uses 1.5 x 14 = 21 ounces of coffee beans per week. Next, we need to figure out how many bags of coffee she needs to buy. Each bag of coffee has 10.5 ounces of beans, so she needs 21 / 10.5 = 2 bags of coffee per week. Two bags of coffee cost $8 each, so she spends 2 x $8 = $16 on coffee per week. Finally, we need to calculate the cost of milk. She uses 1/2 a gallon of milk per week, which costs $4 per gallon. So, she spends 1/2 x $4 = $2 on milk per week. Adding the cost of coffee and milk, Maddie spends $16 + $2 = $18 on her coffee per week. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Claudia has 122 ounces of water and is filling up cups. She has 8-ounce glasses, 5-ounce glasses, and 4-ounce glasses. If she fills six 5 ounce glasses and four 8 ounce glasses, how many 4 ounce glasses can she fill with the remaining water?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much water Claudia has used so far. 6 x 5 = 30 ounces (for six 5-ounce glasses) 4 x 8 = 32 ounces (for four 8-ounce glasses) So, Claudia has used 30 + 32 = 62 ounces of water. Now, let's calculate how much water she has left. 122 - 62 = 60 ounces Finally, let's calculate how many 4-ounce glasses she can fill with the remaining water. 60 / 4 = 15 Therefore, Claudia can fill 15 4-ounce glasses with the remaining water. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Martha needs 4 cups of berries and 2 cups of heavy cream to make 1 quart of ice cream.  She wants to make 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream.  At the farmers market, the 2 cup packages of strawberries are $3.00 each and the 2 cup package of raspberries are $5.00 each.  The heavy cream is sold for $4.00 for a 4 cup container.  How much will it cost her to make 1 quart of each ice cream?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how many packages of strawberries and raspberries Martha needs to make 1 quart of each ice cream. Since she needs 4 cups of berries for 1 quart of ice cream, and each package contains 2 cups, she will need 2 packages of strawberries and 2 packages of raspberries for both quarts of ice cream. The cost of the strawberries will be 2 packages x $3.00 per package = $6.00 for 1 quart of strawberry ice cream. The cost of the raspberries will be 2 packages x $5.00 per package = $10.00 for 1 quart of raspberry ice cream. Next, we need to calculate the cost of the heavy cream. Martha needs 2 cups of heavy cream for 1 quart of ice cream, so she will need 4 cups of heavy cream for both quarts of ice cream. The cost of the heavy cream is $4.00 for a 4 cup container, so it will cost $4.00 for both quarts of ice cream. Therefore, the total cost of making 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream is: $6.00 (strawberries) + $10.00 (raspberries) + $4.00 (heavy cream) = $20.00 The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Carla is making smoothies. If she uses 500 ml of watermelon puree and 100 ml of cream, how many 150 ml servings can she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine the total volume of each serving. To do this, we add the volume of watermelon puree and cream: 500 ml + 100 ml = 600 ml Next, we need to divide the total volume by the volume of each serving: 600 ml \u00f7 150 ml/serving = 4 servings Therefore, Carla can make 4 servings of smoothies with 500 ml of watermelon puree and 100 ml of cream. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Betty and Dora started making some cupcakes at the same time. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour and Dora makes 8 every hour. If Betty took a two-hour break, what is the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Betty made in the first 3 hours before taking a break. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour, so in 3 hours, she would make: 10 cupcakes/hour x 3 hours = 30 cupcakes Next, we need to find out how many cupcakes Dora made in the same 5 hours. Dora makes 8 cupcakes every hour, so in 5 hours, she would make: 8 cupcakes/hour x 5 hours = 40 cupcakes Now we need to find the difference between the number of cupcakes they made. Betty made 30 cupcakes before taking a break, and Dora made 40 cupcakes in the same 5 hours. So the difference between the number of cupcakes they made is: 40 cupcakes - 30 cupcakes = 10 cupcakes Therefore, the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours is 10 cupcakes. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Mary wants 144 cupcakes for her party. Mary has already made 36 cherry cupcakes, and 48 berry cupcakes. Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes for the rest. How much of each should she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Mary has already made: 36 cherry + 48 berry = 84 cupcakes Next, we need to figure out how many more cupcakes Mary needs to make: 144 total cupcakes - 84 cupcakes already made = 60 cupcakes Since Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, we can divide the remaining 60 cupcakes by 2: 60 cupcakes \u00f7 2 = 30 cupcakes of each flavor Therefore, Mary should make 30 chocolate cupcakes and 30 vanilla cupcakes to have a total of 144 cupcakes for her party. The answer is 144.\n\n\nQ: Tim drinks 2 bottles that are each 1.5 quarts and an additional 20 ounces a day.  How much water does he drink a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the 1.5 quarts to ounces. 1 quart = 32 ounces So, 1.5 quarts = 1.5 x 32 = 48 ounces Tim drinks 2 bottles, so he drinks 2 x 48 = 96 ounces from the bottles. He also drinks an additional 20 ounces a day, so he drinks a total of 96 + 20 = 116 ounces a day. To find out how much he drinks in a week, we need to multiply 116 by 7 (the number of days in a week). 116 x 7 = 812 Therefore, Tim drinks 812 ounces of water in a week. The answer is 812.\n\n\nQ: John drinks 2 energy drinks. 1 of them is a 12-ounce drink with 250 grams of caffeine.  The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce but only 2 ounces.  He then takes a caffeine pill that has as much caffeine as his 2 drinks combined.  How much caffeine did he consume?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much caffeine is in the 12-ounce energy drink. We know that it has 250 grams of caffeine, so we can convert that to ounces by dividing by 28.35 (the number of grams in an ounce): 250 / 28.35 = 8.82 ounces of caffeine in the 12-ounce drink Next, we need to find out how much caffeine is in the second energy drink. We know that it is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce than the first drink, so we can multiply the caffeine per ounce in the first drink (8.82 / 12 = 0.735 ounces per ounce) by 3: 0.735 * 3 = 2.205 ounces per ounce in the second drink Since the second drink is only 2 ounces, we can multiply the caffeine per ounce by 2 to find out how much caffeine is in the second drink: 2.205 * 2 = 4.41 ounces of caffeine in the second drink Now we can add up the caffeine in both drinks: 8.82 + 4.41 = 13.23 ounces of caffeine in both drinks Finally, we need to add the caffeine in the caffeine pill. We know that the pill has as much caffeine as both drinks combined, so we can add 13.23 ounces to itself: 13.23 + 13.23 = 26.46 ounces of caffeine in total Therefore, John consumed 26.46 ounces of caffeine in total. The answer is 26.\n\n\n"
