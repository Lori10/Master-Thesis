  "test_question": "Q: 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 different containers. Josey needed 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower. How many pints of gasoline did Josey need?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Twenty gallons of tea were poured into 80 containers. Geraldo drank 3.5 containers. How many pints of tea did Geraldo drink?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many gallons of tea Geraldo drank. We know that he drank 3.5 containers, and each container holds 1/4 gallon of tea (since 20 gallons were poured into 80 containers). So, Geraldo drank: 3.5 containers x 1/4 gallon per container = 7/8 gallon of tea Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so: 7/8 gallon x 8 pints per gallon = 7 pints Therefore, Geraldo drank 7 pints of tea. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: A vampire needs to suck 7 gallons of blood per week to survive.  If he sucks 2 pints of blood per person, how many people does he need to suck each day to survive?\nA: Let's think step by step. 1 gallon = 8 pints (since 1 gallon = 128 fluid ounces and 1 fluid ounce = 0.125 pints) So, 7 gallons = 7 x 8 = 56 pints The vampire needs to suck 56 pints of blood per week to survive. 2 pints of blood per person To find out how many people the vampire needs to suck each day, we need to divide 56 by the number of days in a week (7). 56/7 = 8 Therefore, the vampire needs to suck blood from 8 people each day to survive. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Mark is filling a punch bowl that can hold 16 gallons of punch. He fills it part way, then his cousin comes along and drinks half the punch in the bowl. Mark starts to refill the bowl and adds 4 more gallons, but then his friend Sally comes in and drinks 2 more gallons of punch. After that, Mark has to add 12 gallons of punch to completely fill the bowl. How much punch did Mark initially add to the bowl?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Mark fills the punch bowl part way, but we don't know how much he added yet. Let's call this amount \"x\". Then, his cousin drinks half the punch in the bowl, which means there is now only 8 gallons of punch left in the bowl. Mark starts to refill the bowl and adds 4 more gallons, so there are now 12 gallons of punch in the bowl. But then Sally comes in and drinks 2 more gallons of punch, so there are now only 10 gallons of punch in the bowl. Finally, Mark has to add 12 more gallons of punch to completely fill the bowl, which means the bowl can hold a total of 24 gallons of punch (16 gallons initially + 8 gallons left after cousin drank half). So, we can set up an equation to solve for x: x + 8 + 4 - 2 + 12 = 24 Simplifying, we get: x + 22 = 24 Subtracting 22 from both sides, we get: x = 2 Therefore, Mark initially added 2 gallons of punch to the bowl. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Timmy, Tommy and Tina are filling up a kiddie pool in their backyard.  Each has a pail they fill with water from a house before dumping it into the pool.  If Timmy's pail holds twice as much water as Tommy's, and Tommy's holds 2 gallons more than Tina's, and Tina's is 4 gallons, how much water do the three of them fill the pool with after 3 trips each?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much water each pail can hold. We know that Tina's pail holds 4 gallons. Tommy's pail holds 2 more gallons than Tina's, so it holds 4 + 2 = 6 gallons. Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's, so it holds 6 x 2 = 12 gallons. Now we know how much water each pail can hold, we can figure out how much water they can fill the pool with after 1 trip each. Together, they can fill the pool with 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 gallons of water. After 3 trips each, they will have filled the pool with 22 x 3 = 66 gallons of water. The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: Janet uses her horses' manure as fertilizer. One horse produces 5 gallons of fertilizer per day. Once Janet has collected enough fertilizer, she'll spread it over 20 acres of farmland. Each acre needs 400 gallons of fertilizer and Janet can spread fertilizer over 4 acres per day. If Janet has 80 horses, how long will it take until all her fields are fertilized?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much fertilizer is needed for all 20 acres. Since each acre needs 400 gallons of fertilizer, we can multiply 20 acres by 400 gallons per acre to get: 20 acres x 400 gallons per acre = 8,000 gallons of fertilizer Next, we need to figure out how many days it will take Janet to spread all the fertilizer. Since she can spread fertilizer over 4 acres per day, we can divide the total number of acres by 4 to get: 20 acres \u00f7 4 acres per day = 5 days So it will take Janet 5 days to spread all the fertilizer. Now we need to figure out how much fertilizer she can collect each day. Since each horse produces 5 gallons of fertilizer per day, and she has 80 horses, we can multiply 5 gallons per horse by 80 horses to get: 5 gallons per horse x 80 horses = 400 gallons of fertilizer per day So Janet can collect 400 gallons of fertilizer per day. Finally, we can divide the total amount of fertilizer needed by the amount of fertilizer she can collect per day to get: 8,000 gallons of fertilizer \u00f7 400 gallons per day = 20 days So it will take Janet 20 days to collect enough fertilizer to fertilize all her fields. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: James gets paid $0.50/mile to drive a truck carrying hazardous waste. He has to pay $4.00/gallon for gas and his truck gets 20 miles per gallon. How much profit does he make from a 600 mile trip?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how many gallons of gas James will need for the trip. To do this, we divide the total distance by the truck's gas mileage: 600 miles \u00f7 20 miles per gallon = 30 gallons of gas Next, we need to calculate how much James will spend on gas: 30 gallons x $4.00 per gallon = $120.00 Now we can calculate how much James will earn from the trip: 600 miles x $0.50 per mile = $300.00 Finally, we can calculate James' profit by subtracting the cost of gas from his earnings: $300.00 - $120.00 = $180.00 Therefore, James will make a profit of $180.00 from a 600 mile trip. The answer is 600.\n\n\nQ: Jerry is sweeping up pieces of broken glass in the parking lot. He sweeps up 20 amber pieces, 35 green pieces, and some clear pieces. If the green pieces are 25% of the total glass he sweeps up, how many pieces were clear?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the green pieces are 25% of the total glass, so we can set up an equation: 35 = 0.25x where x is the total number of pieces of glass Jerry sweeps up. We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.25: x = 140 So Jerry sweeps up a total of 140 pieces of glass. We also know that he sweeps up 20 amber pieces and 35 green pieces, so the number of clear pieces must be: 140 - 20 - 35 = 85 Therefore, Jerry swept up 85 clear pieces of glass. The answer is 85.\n\n\nQ: Claudia has 122 ounces of water and is filling up cups. She has 8-ounce glasses, 5-ounce glasses, and 4-ounce glasses. If she fills six 5 ounce glasses and four 8 ounce glasses, how many 4 ounce glasses can she fill with the remaining water?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much water Claudia has used so far. 6 x 5 = 30 ounces (for six 5-ounce glasses) 4 x 8 = 32 ounces (for four 8-ounce glasses) So, Claudia has used 30 + 32 = 62 ounces of water. Now, let's calculate how much water she has left. 122 - 62 = 60 ounces Finally, let's calculate how many 4-ounce glasses she can fill with the remaining water. 60 / 4 = 15 Therefore, Claudia can fill 15 4-ounce glasses with the remaining water. The answer is 4.\n\n\n"
