  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Steve makes 40000$ a year as a teacher.  He loses 20 percent to taxes, 10 percent to healthcare, and 800$ to local union dues.  How much money does Steve take home?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Steve loses to taxes. To do this, we can multiply his salary by the tax rate as a decimal: 20% as a decimal is 0.20 Tax = 40000 x 0.20 = 8000$ Next, we need to find out how much money Steve loses to healthcare. We can use the same method as above: 10% as a decimal is 0.10 Healthcare = 40000 x 0.10 = 4000$ Now we need to subtract the taxes, healthcare, and union dues from Steve's salary to find out how much money he takes home: Take home pay = 40000 - 8000 - 4000 - 800 = 27200$ Therefore, Steve takes home 27200$ after taxes, healthcare, and union dues are deducted from his salary. The answer is 27200.\n\n\nQ: Doris earns $20 per hour by babysitting. She needs to earn at least $1200 for her monthly expenses. She can babysit for 3 hours every weekday and 5 hours on a Saturday.  How many weeks does it take for Doris to earn enough to cover her monthly expenses?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much Doris earns per week by babysitting. She babysits for 3 hours every weekday, which is a total of 15 hours per week (3 hours x 5 days). She also babysits for 5 hours on a Saturday, which adds another 5 hours to her weekly total. So, in total, she babysits for 20 hours per week. If she earns $20 per hour, then she earns 20 x 20 = $400 per week. To cover her monthly expenses of $1200, she needs to earn 1200 / 400 = 3 weeks of babysitting. Therefore, it takes Doris 3 weeks to earn enough to cover her monthly expenses. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Sarah wants to start a cupcake business and was approved for a business loan.  The loan has 0% interest if she pays the entire amount back in 5 years, which she decides to do.  If she put $10,000 down as a down payment and her monthly payments are $600.00, how much was her loan for (including the down payment)?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total number of months in 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 5 years would be 5 x 12 = 60 months. Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money Sarah will pay in monthly payments. She will pay $600 per month for 60 months, so the total amount of money she will pay is 600 x 60 = $36,000. Now, we can calculate the total cost of the loan, including the down payment. Sarah put $10,000 down, and she will pay $36,000 in monthly payments, so the total cost of the loan is $10,000 + $36,000 = $46,000. Therefore, Sarah's loan was for $46,000 (including the down payment). The answer is 46000.\n\n\nQ: Danielle bought a new house for $280k. She paid a $40k deposit on the house, and pays the rest using a mortgage that is spread out over 10 years. Danielle makes equal payments every month and at the end of the 10 years, the entire balance will be paid off. How much, in thousands of dollars, does Danielle pay each month?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much Danielle still owes on the house after paying the $40k deposit. $280k - $40k = $240k Next, we need to figure out how many months there are in 10 years. 10 years x 12 months/year = 120 months Finally, we can divide the remaining balance by the number of months to find out how much Danielle pays each month. $240k \u00f7 120 months = $2000/month Therefore, Danielle pays $2000 per month towards her mortgage. The answer is 2000.\n\n\nQ: Logan makes $65,000 a year. He spends $20,000 on rent every year, $5000 on groceries every year, and $8000 on gas every year. If he wants to have at least $42000 left, how much more money must he make each year?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how much Logan spends in total each year: $20,000 (rent) + $5,000 (groceries) + $8,000 (gas) = $33,000 Next, we need to subtract that amount from his annual income: $65,000 (income) - $33,000 (expenses) = $32,000 So Logan currently has $32,000 left after paying his expenses. However, he wants to have at least $42,000 left. Therefore, we need to calculate how much more money he needs to make each year: $42,000 (desired savings) - $32,000 (current savings) = $10,000 Therefore, Logan needs to make at least $10,000 more each year to reach his desired savings goal. The answer is 10000.\n\n\nQ: Gwen received a $900 bonus at work and decided to invest this money in the stock market.  She spent one-third of her bonus on stock A, one-third on stock B, and the remaining one-third on stock C.   After one year, stock A and stock B had doubled in value, while stock C had lost half of its value.  At the end of the year, how much were Gwen's stocks worth, in dollars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Gwen spent on each stock. Since she spent one-third of her bonus on each stock, we can calculate: - Stock A: 1/3 x $900 = $300 - Stock B: 1/3 x $900 = $300 - Stock C: 1/3 x $900 = $300 Next, we need to calculate the value of each stock after one year: - Stock A: $300 x 2 = $600 - Stock B: $300 x 2 = $600 - Stock C: $300 / 2 = $150 Finally, we can add up the value of all three stocks to find out how much Gwen's stocks are worth after one year: - Total value = $600 + $600 + $150 = $1,350 Therefore, Gwen's stocks are worth $1,350 after one year. The answer is 1350.\n\n\nQ: Carson runs a carpool for five of his friends. The five of them cover all the gas expenses to compensate Carson for his time. Their total commute is 21 miles one way, gas costs $2.50/gallon, Carson's car gets 30 miles/gallon, and they commute to work 5 days a week, 4 weeks a month. How much does each person pay toward gas monthly?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per day. Since they commute 21 miles one way, their round trip is 21 x 2 = 42 miles. Next, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per week. They commute 42 miles per day, and they commute 5 days a week, so they commute 42 x 5 = 210 miles per week. Then, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per month. They commute 210 miles per week, and they commute 4 weeks a month, so they commute 210 x 4 = 840 miles per month. Now, we need to find out how many gallons of gas they need per month. Carson's car gets 30 miles per gallon, and they commute 840 miles per month, so they need 840/30 = 28 gallons of gas per month. Finally, we need to find out how much each person pays toward gas monthly. The total cost of gas is $2.50 per gallon, and they need 28 gallons of gas per month, so the total cost of gas is 2.5 x 28 = $70 per month. Since there are 6 people in the carpool (Carson and his 5 friends), each person pays 70/6 = $11.67 toward gas monthly. The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: Ayla has a customer care job whose primary role is to hear complaints from customers and advise them on the best way to solve their problems. She talks with each customer for a limited amount of time, and each phone call is charged five cents per minute. If each call lasts 1 hour, what's the phone bill at the end of the month if she manages to talk to 50 customers a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many minutes are in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, each call lasts 60 minutes. Next, we need to find out how many minutes Ayla spends on the phone each week. If she talks to 50 customers a week, and each call lasts 60 minutes, then she spends 50 x 60 = 3000 minutes on the phone each week. Now we can calculate the cost of the phone bill. Each minute costs five cents, so 3000 minutes will cost 3000 x $0.05 = $150. Therefore, the phone bill at the end of the month will be $150 x 4 = $600 if Ayla manages to talk to 50 customers a week. The answer is 50.\n\n\n"
