  "test_question": "Q: Ashley's pizza delivery costs $15. What is the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man if she wants to give a tip that is equal to 1/5 of the amount she ordered?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Marco has $24. Mary has $15. If Marco gives Mary half of what he has, Mary will have more than Marco. But Mary spends $5. How much more money does Mary have than Marco?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much money Marco gives to Mary. Since Marco has $24, half of that would be $12. So, Marco gives $12 to Mary. After receiving $12 from Marco, Mary will have $15 + $12 = $27. However, Mary spends $5, so we need to subtract that from her total. $27 - $5 = $22. Therefore, Mary has $22 more than Marco. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Keesha wants to get her hair and nails done for prom.  Hair updos cost $50 and manicures cost $30.  How much will these two services cost her with a 20% tip for each beautician?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the hair updo and the manicure without the tip. Hair updo = $50 Manicure = $30 Next, we need to calculate the tip for each service. Tip for hair updo = 20% of $50 = $10 Tip for manicure = 20% of $30 = $6 Now, we can add up the cost of the services and the tips. Total cost = Hair updo + Manicure + Tip for hair updo + Tip for manicure Total cost = $50 + $30 + $10 + $6 Total cost = $96 Therefore, Keesha will need to pay $96 for her hair and nails with a 20% tip for each beautician. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Five people are planning a party. Sonja will buy a loaf of French bread ($3 a loaf) and a platter of cold cuts ($23). Barbara will buy the soda ($1 per person) and two boxes of crackers ($2 per box). Mario and Rick will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles ($3 per package). Danica will supply a package of paper plates for $4. How much more will Sonja spend than the rest of the office put together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of Barbara's contribution. She will buy soda for 5 people, which will cost $5 (1 dollar per person). She will also buy two boxes of crackers, which will cost $4 (2 dollars per box). Therefore, Barbara's total contribution will be $9. Next, let's calculate the total cost of Mario and Rick's contribution. They will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles, which will cost $6 in total (3 dollars per package). Now, let's add up the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's. Barbara's contribution is $9, Mario and Rick's contribution is $6, and Danica's contribution is $4. Therefore, the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's is $19. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of Sonja's contribution. She will buy a loaf of French bread for $3 and a platter of cold cuts for $23. Therefore, Sonja's total contribution will be $26. To find out how much more Sonja will spend than the rest of the office put together, we need to subtract the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's from Sonja's total contribution. $26 (Sonja's contribution) - $19 (total cost of everyone else's contribution) = $7 Therefore, Sonja will spend $7 more than the rest of the office put together. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Phoebe has two pizzas to share with her and three friends. One has pepperoni and the other has cheese. They both have 16 slices. They all eat the same amount. One friend eats only pepperoni, while the rest have an equal number of slices of each. At the end, there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese, how many slices does each person eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 2 pizzas with 16 slices each, so there are a total of 32 slices. Next, we know that one friend only eats pepperoni, so they eat one slice from the pepperoni pizza. That leaves 31 slices, with 15 slices from each pizza. We also know that there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese left. So, the remaining 15 slices are divided equally among the remaining 3 friends, which means each of them eats 5 slices. Therefore, each person eats 1 slice of pepperoni and 5 slices of cheese. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: At Penny\u2019s bakery, her famous blueberry cheesecakes are $7 a slice.  Each cheesecake pie is cut into 6 thick slices.  If she sells 7 cheesecake pies, how much money does she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of cheesecake Penny has in total. Since each cheesecake pie is cut into 6 slices, we can multiply 6 by the number of cheesecake pies she sold: 6 slices/pie x 7 pies = 42 slices So Penny sold 42 slices of blueberry cheesecake. Next, we need to find out how much money she made from selling those 42 slices. Each slice costs $7, so we can multiply 7 by the number of slices: $7/slice x 42 slices = $294 Therefore, Penny made $294 from selling 7 cheesecake pies. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Phill cuts the pizza in half, which gives him 2 slices. Then he cuts both halves in half, which gives him 4 slices. And then he cuts each slice in half again, which gives him 8 slices in total. Next, Phill passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends, which means he gives away 3 slices in total. He also passes out 2 slices to 2 of his friends, which means he gives away 4 slices in total. Therefore, Phill has given away a total of 7 slices of pizza. If he started with 8 slices, then he has 1 slice left for himself. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Michael has $42. Michael gives away half the money to his brother. His brother then buys 3 dollars worth of candy. If his brother has $35 left, how much money, in dollars, did his brother have at first?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Michael had $42. Next, he gave away half of that money to his brother, which is $21. His brother then spent $3 on candy, leaving him with $35. To figure out how much money his brother had at first, we need to work backwards. If his brother had $35 after spending $3 on candy, then he had $38 before buying the candy. And if his brother received $21 from Michael, then he must have had $17 to begin with. Therefore, his brother had $17 at first. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Apples used to cost $1.6 per pound.  The price got raised 25%.  How much does it cost to buy 2 pounds of apples for each person in a 4 member family?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Calculate the new price of apples after the 25% increase. The price increase is 25% of $1.6, which is (25/100) x $1.6 = $0.4. So, the new price of apples is $1.6 + $0.4 = $2. Step 2: Calculate the cost of buying 2 pounds of apples for each person in the family. Since there are 4 members in the family, we need to buy 2 x 4 = 8 pounds of apples in total. The cost of buying 1 pound of apples is $2, so the cost of buying 8 pounds of apples is 8 x $2 = $16. Therefore, it would cost $16 to buy 2 pounds of apples for each person in a 4 member family. The answer is 4.\n\n\n"
