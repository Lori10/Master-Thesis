  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Doris earns $20 per hour by babysitting. She needs to earn at least $1200 for her monthly expenses. She can babysit for 3 hours every weekday and 5 hours on a Saturday.  How many weeks does it take for Doris to earn enough to cover her monthly expenses?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much Doris earns per week by babysitting. She babysits for 3 hours every weekday, which is a total of 15 hours per week (3 hours x 5 days). She also babysits for 5 hours on a Saturday, which adds another 5 hours to her weekly total. So, in total, she babysits for 20 hours per week. If she earns $20 per hour, then she earns 20 x 20 = $400 per week. To cover her monthly expenses of $1200, she needs to earn 1200 / 400 = 3 weeks of babysitting. Therefore, it takes Doris 3 weeks to earn enough to cover her monthly expenses. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Yoque borrowed money from her sister. She promised to pay it back in 11 months including an additional 10% of the money she borrowed. If she pays $15 per month, how much money did she borrow?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Yoque borrowed some amount of money from her sister. Let's call this amount \"x\". Next, we know that Yoque promised to pay back the money in 11 months, and that this includes an additional 10% of the money she borrowed. This means that Yoque will pay back the original amount she borrowed (x) plus 10% of that amount (0.1x). So the total amount Yoque will pay back is: x + 0.1x = 1.1x Finally, we know that Yoque will pay back this total amount over 11 months, at a rate of $15 per month. So we can set up an equation: 1.1x / 11 = 15 To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 11: 1.1x = 165 And then divide both sides by 1.1: x = 150 So Yoque borrowed $150 from her sister. The answer is 150.\n\n\nQ: Each week Jaime saves $50. Every two weeks she spends $46 of her savings on a nice lunch with her mum. How long will it take her to save $135?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much money Jaime saves in a week after spending $46 every two weeks on lunch with her mom. In two weeks, Jaime spends $46 on lunch, so in one week, she spends $23 on lunch. Therefore, Jaime saves $50 - $23 = $27 per week. Next, we need to figure out how many weeks it will take Jaime to save $135. We can set up an equation: $27 per week x number of weeks = $135 To solve for the number of weeks, we can divide both sides by $27: number of weeks = $135 / $27 number of weeks = 5 Therefore, it will take Jaime 5 weeks to save $135. The answer is 135.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: Ayla has a customer care job whose primary role is to hear complaints from customers and advise them on the best way to solve their problems. She talks with each customer for a limited amount of time, and each phone call is charged five cents per minute. If each call lasts 1 hour, what's the phone bill at the end of the month if she manages to talk to 50 customers a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many minutes are in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, each call lasts 60 minutes. Next, we need to find out how many minutes Ayla spends on the phone each week. If she talks to 50 customers a week, and each call lasts 60 minutes, then she spends 50 x 60 = 3000 minutes on the phone each week. Now we can calculate the cost of the phone bill. Each minute costs five cents, so 3000 minutes will cost 3000 x $0.05 = $150. Therefore, the phone bill at the end of the month will be $150 x 4 = $600 if Ayla manages to talk to 50 customers a week. The answer is 50.\n\n\nQ: Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how much money Carl will earn in four weeks. If he earns $0.50 every time, and he buys a candy bar each time, that means he's spending $0.50 each week. But he's also earning $0.75 each week for taking out his neighbor's trash. So his net earnings each week are $0.75 - $0.50 = $0.25. Over four weeks, that's a total of $0.25 x 4 = $1. So Carl will have $1 to spend on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.50, he can buy 2 candy bars with his earnings. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Jill spends time every day talking to her boyfriend on the phone.  The first day of the week she spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend.  Each of the following days she spends twice as much time talking on the phone as the day before. After the 5th day her parents take the phone away from her because she was on it too long.  How much time did Jill spend talking to her boyfriend that week?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Jill spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend. On the second day, she spends twice as much time as the first day, which is 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 minutes. On the third day, she spends twice as much time as the second day, which is 2*10=<<2*10=20>>20 minutes. On the fourth day, she spends twice as much time as the third day, which is 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 minutes. On the fifth day, she spends twice as much time as the fourth day, which is 2*40=<<2*40=80>>80 minutes. Therefore, Jill spends a total of 5+10+20+40+80=<<5+10+20+40+80=155>>155 minutes talking to her boyfriend that week. The answer is 155.\n\n\nQ: Grant spends $200.00 a year to have the newspaper delivered daily to his house.  Juanita buys the newspaper daily.  Monday through Saturday, she spends $0.50 and on Sunday she spends $2.00.  How much more money does Juanita spend buying the newspaper yearly than Grant?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper daily from Monday to Saturday: $0.50 x 6 = $3.00 Now, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper on Sundays: $2.00 x 1 = $2.00 Next, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper weekly: $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00 Finally, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper yearly: $5.00 x 52 = $260.00 Now, let's calculate the difference between what Juanita spends and what Grant spends: $260.00 - $200.00 = $60.00 Therefore, Juanita spends $60.00 more buying the newspaper yearly than Grant. The answer is 60.\n\n\n"
