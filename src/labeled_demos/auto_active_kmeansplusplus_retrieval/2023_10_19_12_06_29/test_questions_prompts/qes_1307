  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Jeremy buys 30 watermelons. He eats 3 watermelons per week. Each week he gives 2 to his dad. How many weeks will the watermelons last?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many watermelons Jeremy eats per week and how many he gives to his dad. Jeremy eats 3 watermelons per week and gives 2 to his dad, so he uses a total of 5 watermelons per week. Next, we need to divide the total number of watermelons by the number of watermelons used per week to find out how many weeks the watermelons will last. 30 watermelons \u00f7 5 watermelons per week = 6 weeks Therefore, the watermelons will last for 6 weeks. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: James takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces.  He splits the pieces between 4 people.  If an orange has 80 calories how many calories does each person get?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pieces James has in total. He takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces, so he has 5 x 8 = 40 pieces in total. Next, we need to divide the pieces between 4 people. To do this, we can divide the total number of pieces by 4: 40 \u00f7 4 = 10 pieces per person. Finally, we need to find out how many calories each person gets. We know that one orange has 80 calories, so each piece has 80 \u00f7 8 = 10 calories. Therefore, each person gets 10 x 10 = 100 calories. So each person gets 100 calories. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Carla is making smoothies. If she uses 500 ml of watermelon puree and 100 ml of cream, how many 150 ml servings can she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine the total volume of each serving. To do this, we add the volume of watermelon puree and cream: 500 ml + 100 ml = 600 ml Next, we need to divide the total volume by the volume of each serving: 600 ml \u00f7 150 ml/serving = 4 servings Therefore, Carla can make 4 servings of smoothies with 500 ml of watermelon puree and 100 ml of cream. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of 18 watermelons. Since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, the total weight of 18 watermelons would be: 23 x 18 = 414 pounds Next, we need to find the total amount of money Farmer Kent would make by selling these watermelons. Since he sells them for $2 a pound, we can multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 414 x $2 = $828 Therefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Phoebe has two pizzas to share with her and three friends. One has pepperoni and the other has cheese. They both have 16 slices. They all eat the same amount. One friend eats only pepperoni, while the rest have an equal number of slices of each. At the end, there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese, how many slices does each person eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 2 pizzas with 16 slices each, so there are a total of 32 slices. Next, we know that one friend only eats pepperoni, so they eat one slice from the pepperoni pizza. That leaves 31 slices, with 15 slices from each pizza. We also know that there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese left. So, the remaining 15 slices are divided equally among the remaining 3 friends, which means each of them eats 5 slices. Therefore, each person eats 1 slice of pepperoni and 5 slices of cheese. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Phill cuts the pizza in half, which gives him 2 slices. Then he cuts both halves in half, which gives him 4 slices. And then he cuts each slice in half again, which gives him 8 slices in total. Next, Phill passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends, which means he gives away 3 slices in total. He also passes out 2 slices to 2 of his friends, which means he gives away 4 slices in total. Therefore, Phill has given away a total of 7 slices of pizza. If he started with 8 slices, then he has 1 slice left for himself. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: To make fried green tomatoes, Thelma cuts each green tomato into 8 slices before cooking them up.  If 20 slices of fried green tomato make a meal for a single person, how many tomatoes will Thelma need to make enough fried green tomatoes to feed a family of 8 for a single meal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many slices of fried green tomatoes are needed for a family of 8 for a single meal. We know that 20 slices make a meal for a single person, so for 8 people, we need: 20 slices/person x 8 people = 160 slices Next, we need to figure out how many tomatoes are needed to make 160 slices. We know that Thelma cuts each tomato into 8 slices, so: 160 slices \u00f7 8 slices/tomato = 20 tomatoes Therefore, Thelma will need 20 tomatoes to make enough fried green tomatoes to feed a family of 8 for a single meal. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many students are in Alice's class. We know that there are 40 students and 10 instructors, so the total number of people in the class is 40 + 10 = 50. Next, we need to figure out how many students are bringing their own life vests. We know that 20% of the students are bringing life vests, so we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of students by 0.2: 40 x 0.2 = 8. So 8 students are bringing their own life vests. Now we need to figure out how many life vests we still need. We have 20 life vests on hand, and we need one for each of the 50 people in the class. So we need 50 - 20 = 30 more life vests. However, we already know that 8 students are bringing their own life vests, so we can subtract those from the total number we need: 30 - 8 = 22. Therefore, Alice needs to get 22 more life vests so that the entire class has one. The answer is 22.\n\n\n"
