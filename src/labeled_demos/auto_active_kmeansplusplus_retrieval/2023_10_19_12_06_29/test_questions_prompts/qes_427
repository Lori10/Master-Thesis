  "test_question": "Q: Rozanne is making eggnog for her family. She uses 4 dozen eggs that were in cases and another 2 eggs that were loose in the cupboard. She puts out trays that each hold 5 glasses of eggnog. If each glass needs 5 eggs, how many trays can Rozanne put out?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Giselle had 20 female doves in a birdhouse. After a month, the doves laid 3 eggs each. If 3/4 of the eggs hatched, calculate the total number of doves Giselle has now.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many eggs were laid in total. Since each dove laid 3 eggs, we can multiply the number of doves by 3: 20 doves x 3 eggs/dove = 60 eggs Next, we need to find out how many of those eggs hatched. We know that 3/4 of the eggs hatched, so we can multiply the total number of eggs by 3/4: 60 eggs x 3/4 = 45 eggs hatched Finally, we need to add the number of original doves (20) to the number of hatched eggs (45) to find the total number of doves: 20 doves + 45 doves = 65 doves Therefore, Giselle now has 65 doves. The answer is 65.\n\n\nQ: Claudia has 122 ounces of water and is filling up cups. She has 8-ounce glasses, 5-ounce glasses, and 4-ounce glasses. If she fills six 5 ounce glasses and four 8 ounce glasses, how many 4 ounce glasses can she fill with the remaining water?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much water Claudia has used so far. 6 x 5 = 30 ounces (for six 5-ounce glasses) 4 x 8 = 32 ounces (for four 8-ounce glasses) So, Claudia has used 30 + 32 = 62 ounces of water. Now, let's calculate how much water she has left. 122 - 62 = 60 ounces Finally, let's calculate how many 4-ounce glasses she can fill with the remaining water. 60 / 4 = 15 Therefore, Claudia can fill 15 4-ounce glasses with the remaining water. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much milk one cow produces in a week. We can do this by dividing the total amount of milk produced in 5 weeks (2160 liters) by the number of weeks (5) and the number of cows (x): 2160 = 6x * 108 * 5 2160 = 540x x = 4 Therefore, there are 4 cows on the farm. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Mary wants 144 cupcakes for her party. Mary has already made 36 cherry cupcakes, and 48 berry cupcakes. Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes for the rest. How much of each should she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Mary has already made: 36 cherry + 48 berry = 84 cupcakes Next, we need to figure out how many more cupcakes Mary needs to make: 144 total cupcakes - 84 cupcakes already made = 60 cupcakes Since Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, we can divide the remaining 60 cupcakes by 2: 60 cupcakes \u00f7 2 = 30 cupcakes of each flavor Therefore, Mary should make 30 chocolate cupcakes and 30 vanilla cupcakes to have a total of 144 cupcakes for her party. The answer is 144.\n\n\nQ: Sandra eats 3 beignets every morning.  How many beignets will she eat in 16 weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many beignets Sandra eats in one week. To do this, we can multiply the number of beignets she eats in one day (3) by the number of days in a week (7): 3 beignets/day x 7 days/week = 21 beignets/week So Sandra eats 21 beignets in one week. Next, we need to find out how many beignets she will eat in 16 weeks. To do this, we can multiply the number of beignets she eats in one week (21) by the number of weeks (16): 21 beignets/week x 16 weeks = 336 beignets Therefore, Sandra will eat 336 beignets in 16 weeks. The answer is 16.\n\n\nQ: MIlle is making snack packs for her kindergarten class. She's going to divide 64 pretzels, four times as many goldfish, and 32 suckers into baggies for the 16 kids in the class. How many items does each baggie have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many goldfish there are. We know that there are four times as many goldfish as pretzels, so: 64 pretzels x 4 = 256 goldfish Next, we need to add up the total number of items: 64 pretzels + 256 goldfish + 32 suckers = 352 items Now we can divide the total number of items by the number of baggies: 352 items \u00f7 16 baggies = 22 items per baggie Therefore, each baggie will have 22 items, which includes pretzels, goldfish, and suckers. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Dani brings two and half dozen cupcakes for her 2nd-grade class.  There are 27 students (including Dani), 1 teacher, and 1 teacher\u2019s aid.  If 3 students called in sick that day, how many cupcakes are left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Dani brought in total. Two and a half dozen cupcakes is equal to 30 cupcakes (since a dozen is 12). Next, we need to figure out how many people will be receiving cupcakes. There are 27 students, 1 teacher, and 1 teacher's aid, for a total of 29 people. However, 3 students called in sick, so we need to subtract them from the total. 29 - 3 = 26 people receiving cupcakes. Now, we need to subtract 26 cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes Dani brought. 30 - 26 = 4 cupcakes left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Jackson is making pancakes with three ingredients: flour, milk and eggs. 20% of the bottles of milk are spoiled and the rest are fresh. 60% of the eggs are rotten. 1/4 of the cannisters of flour have weevils in them. If Jackson picks a bottle of milk, an egg and a canister of flour at random, what are the odds all three ingredients will be good?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the probability that a bottle of milk is fresh. We know that 20% of the bottles are spoiled, so 80% are fresh. Next, we need to find the probability that an egg is not rotten. We know that 60% of the eggs are rotten, so 40% are not. Finally, we need to find the probability that a canister of flour does not have weevils. We know that 1/4 of the canisters have weevils, so 3/4 do not. To find the probability that all three ingredients are good, we need to multiply the probabilities of each event happening: 0.8 (probability of fresh milk) x 0.4 (probability of not rotten egg) x 0.75 (probability of no weevils in flour) = 0.24 So the odds of all three ingredients being good are 0.24 or 24%. The answer is 24.\n\n\n"
