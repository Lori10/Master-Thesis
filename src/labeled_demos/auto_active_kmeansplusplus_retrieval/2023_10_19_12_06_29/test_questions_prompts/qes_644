  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Forty percent of the students have elected to learn from home during the pandemic. The remaining students are divided into two equal groups, only one of which is physically in school on any day. What percent of students are present in school?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Let's assume that there are 100 students in total. Step 2: 40% of the students have elected to learn from home during the pandemic. So, the number of students learning from home is 40% of 100, which is 40. Step 3: The remaining students are 60 (100 - 40). Step 4: The remaining students are divided into two equal groups, so each group has 30 students. Step 5: Only one of the two groups is physically in school on any day. So, the number of students present in school is 30. Step 6: To find the percentage of students present in school, we need to divide the number of students present in school by the total number of students and multiply by 100. 30/100 x 100 = 30% Therefore, 30% of students are present in school. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: Ryan works in an office that has an even number of men and women working there.  Ryan participates in a meeting composed of 4 men and 6 women who are pulled from the office floor.   This reduces the number of women working on the office floor by 20%.  How many people work at Ryan's office?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the number of men and women in the office is even. Let's call this number \"x\". Next, we know that 4 men and 6 women were pulled from the office floor for the meeting. This means that there are now x-4 men and x-6 women still working on the office floor. We also know that the number of women on the office floor decreased by 20%. This means that the new number of women on the office floor is 0.8(x-6). Since we know that the number of men and women in the office is even, we can set up an equation: x-4 + 0.8(x-6) = x Simplifying this equation: 0.8x - 1.2 = 0 0.8x = 1.2 x = 1.2/0.8 x = 1.5 Since we know that x is an even number, the closest even number to 1.5 is 2. Therefore, there are 2 men and 2 women working at Ryan's office. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many students are in Alice's class. We know that there are 40 students and 10 instructors, so the total number of people in the class is 40 + 10 = 50. Next, we need to figure out how many students are bringing their own life vests. We know that 20% of the students are bringing life vests, so we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of students by 0.2: 40 x 0.2 = 8. So 8 students are bringing their own life vests. Now we need to figure out how many life vests we still need. We have 20 life vests on hand, and we need one for each of the 50 people in the class. So we need 50 - 20 = 30 more life vests. However, we already know that 8 students are bringing their own life vests, so we can subtract those from the total number we need: 30 - 8 = 22. Therefore, Alice needs to get 22 more life vests so that the entire class has one. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: John is working as an IT specialist. He repairs broken computers. One day he had to fix 20 computers. 20% of them were unfixable, and 40% of them needed to wait a few days for spare parts to come. The rest John was able to fix right away. How many computers John was able to fix right away?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many computers were unfixable. We know that 20% of 20 computers were unfixable, so we can calculate: 20% of 20 = 0.2 x 20 = 4 So, John couldn't fix 4 computers. Next, we need to find out how many computers needed to wait for spare parts. We know that 40% of 20 computers needed to wait, so we can calculate: 40% of 20 = 0.4 x 20 = 8 So, 8 computers needed to wait for spare parts. Now, we can subtract the unfixable and waiting computers from the total to find out how many John was able to fix right away: 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 Therefore, John was able to fix 8 computers right away. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Two-thirds of the class have brown eyes. Half of the students with brown eyes have black hair. If there are 6 students in the class with brown eyes and black hair, how many students are there in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that two-thirds of the class have brown eyes. Let's represent the total number of students in the class as \"x\". Then, we can write: (2/3)x = number of students with brown eyes Next, we know that half of the students with brown eyes have black hair. So, we can take half of the number of students with brown eyes to find the number of students with both brown eyes and black hair: (1/2)(2/3)x = 6 Simplifying this equation, we get: (1/3)x = 6 Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: x = 18 Therefore, there are 18 students in total. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: 7 out of 40 people in a cafeteria are wearing checkered shirts. The rest of the people are wearing vertical stripes and horizontal stripes. The number of people wearing horizontal stripes is 4 times as many as the people wearing checkered shirts. How many people are wearing vertical stripes?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that 7 out of 40 people are wearing checkered shirts. So, the number of people wearing horizontal and vertical stripes is 40 - 7 = 33. Step 2: We also know that the number of people wearing horizontal stripes is 4 times as many as the people wearing checkered shirts. So, the number of people wearing horizontal stripes is 4 x 7 = 28. Step 3: To find the number of people wearing vertical stripes, we can subtract the number of people wearing checkered and horizontal stripes from the total number of people. So, the number of people wearing vertical stripes is 33 - 7 - 28 = 6. Therefore, there are 6 people wearing vertical stripes in the cafeteria. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Steve makes 40000$ a year as a teacher.  He loses 20 percent to taxes, 10 percent to healthcare, and 800$ to local union dues.  How much money does Steve take home?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Steve loses to taxes. To do this, we can multiply his salary by the tax rate as a decimal: 20% as a decimal is 0.20 Tax = 40000 x 0.20 = 8000$ Next, we need to find out how much money Steve loses to healthcare. We can use the same method as above: 10% as a decimal is 0.10 Healthcare = 40000 x 0.10 = 4000$ Now we need to subtract the taxes, healthcare, and union dues from Steve's salary to find out how much money he takes home: Take home pay = 40000 - 8000 - 4000 - 800 = 27200$ Therefore, Steve takes home 27200$ after taxes, healthcare, and union dues are deducted from his salary. The answer is 27200.\n\n\nQ: Los Angeles has 6 million people living in it. If half the population is women and 1/3 of the women work in retail, how many women work in retail in Los Angeles?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of women in Los Angeles. Half of the population is women, so we can calculate: 6 million / 2 = 3 million women Step 2: Find the number of women who work in retail. One-third of the women work in retail, so we can calculate: 3 million / 3 = 1 million women work in retail Therefore, there are 1 million women who work in retail in Los Angeles. The answer is 1.\n\n\n"
