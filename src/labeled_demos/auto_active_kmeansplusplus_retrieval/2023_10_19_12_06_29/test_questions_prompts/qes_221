  "test_question": "Q: John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.  The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.  He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on ties?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: John buys 500 newspapers.  Each newspaper sells for $2.  He sells 80% of them.  He buys them all for 75% less than the price at which he sells them.  How much profit does he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much John buys the newspapers for. He buys them for 75% less than the price at which he sells them, which means he buys them for 25% of the selling price. 25% of the selling price = 0.25 x 2 = $0.50 So, John buys each newspaper for $0.50. Next, let's calculate how much John earns from selling the newspapers. He sells 80% of the 500 newspapers, which is: 0.8 x 500 = 400 newspapers He sells each newspaper for $2, so his total earnings are: 400 x 2 = $800 Now, let's calculate how much John spent on buying the newspapers: 500 x 0.50 = $250 Therefore, John's profit is: $800 - $250 = $550 So, John makes a profit of $550. The answer is 550.\n\n\nQ: Marco has $24. Mary has $15. If Marco gives Mary half of what he has, Mary will have more than Marco. But Mary spends $5. How much more money does Mary have than Marco?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much money Marco gives to Mary. Since Marco has $24, half of that would be $12. So, Marco gives $12 to Mary. After receiving $12 from Marco, Mary will have $15 + $12 = $27. However, Mary spends $5, so we need to subtract that from her total. $27 - $5 = $22. Therefore, Mary has $22 more than Marco. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Jim buys a wedding ring for $10,000.  He gets his wife a ring that is twice that much and sells the first one for half its value.  How much is he out of pocket?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Jim buys a wedding ring for $10,000. Next, we know that he gets his wife a ring that is twice that much, which means he spends $20,000 on her ring. Now, he sells the first ring for half its value, which means he sells it for $5,000. To find out how much Jim is out of pocket, we need to add up all of his expenses and subtract any income he received from selling the first ring. So, Jim's total expenses are $10,000 + $20,000 = $30,000. His income from selling the first ring is $5,000. Therefore, Jim is out of pocket $30,000 - $5,000 = $25,000. The answer is 25000.\n\n\nQ: Michael has $42. Michael gives away half the money to his brother. His brother then buys 3 dollars worth of candy. If his brother has $35 left, how much money, in dollars, did his brother have at first?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Michael had $42. Next, he gave away half of that money to his brother, which is $21. His brother then spent $3 on candy, leaving him with $35. To figure out how much money his brother had at first, we need to work backwards. If his brother had $35 after spending $3 on candy, then he had $38 before buying the candy. And if his brother received $21 from Michael, then he must have had $17 to begin with. Therefore, his brother had $17 at first. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Five people are planning a party. Sonja will buy a loaf of French bread ($3 a loaf) and a platter of cold cuts ($23). Barbara will buy the soda ($1 per person) and two boxes of crackers ($2 per box). Mario and Rick will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles ($3 per package). Danica will supply a package of paper plates for $4. How much more will Sonja spend than the rest of the office put together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of Barbara's contribution. She will buy soda for 5 people, which will cost $5 (1 dollar per person). She will also buy two boxes of crackers, which will cost $4 (2 dollars per box). Therefore, Barbara's total contribution will be $9. Next, let's calculate the total cost of Mario and Rick's contribution. They will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles, which will cost $6 in total (3 dollars per package). Now, let's add up the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's. Barbara's contribution is $9, Mario and Rick's contribution is $6, and Danica's contribution is $4. Therefore, the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's is $19. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of Sonja's contribution. She will buy a loaf of French bread for $3 and a platter of cold cuts for $23. Therefore, Sonja's total contribution will be $26. To find out how much more Sonja will spend than the rest of the office put together, we need to subtract the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's from Sonja's total contribution. $26 (Sonja's contribution) - $19 (total cost of everyone else's contribution) = $7 Therefore, Sonja will spend $7 more than the rest of the office put together. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: John is performing in 3 plays.  Each play has 5 Acts.  He wears 2 wigs per act.  Each wig cost $5.  He drops one of the plays and sells all of the wigs for that play for $4.  How much money did he spend?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many wigs John needs in total. Since he performs in 3 plays and each play has 5 acts, he needs 3 x 5 = 15 wigs in total. Next, we need to find out how much he spent on all the wigs. Since he wears 2 wigs per act, he needs 2 x 15 = 30 wigs in total. Each wig costs $5, so he spent 30 x $5 = $150 on all the wigs. Now, we need to find out how much money he made by selling the wigs from one of the plays. He sold all the wigs for $4 each, so he made 15 x $4 = $60. Finally, we need to subtract the money he made from the money he spent to find out how much money he spent in total. $150 - $60 = $90. Therefore, John spent $90 on all the wigs. The answer is 90.\n\n\nQ: Lorie has 2 pieces of $100 bills. He requested to change one piece of the $100 bills into $50 bills. Half of the remaining $100 bill is changed to $10 bills while the rest is changed to $5 bills. How many pieces of bills will she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Lorie has 2 pieces of $100 bills, which means she has a total of $200. Next, she changes one piece of the $100 bill into $50 bills. One piece of $100 bill is equal to 2 pieces of $50 bills, so she now has a total of $200 - $100 + $100 = $200. Half of the remaining $100 bill is changed to $10 bills. Half of $100 is $50, so she changes $50 into $10 bills. $50 divided by $10 is 5, so she now has 5 pieces of $10 bills. The rest of the remaining $100 bill is changed to $5 bills. The remaining amount is $50, and $50 divided by $5 is 10, so she now has 10 pieces of $5 bills. Therefore, Lorie now has a total of 2 pieces of $50 bills, 5 pieces of $10 bills, and 10 pieces of $5 bills, which is a total of 17 pieces of bills. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\n"
