  "test_question": "Q: Uncle Ben has four horses. Each horse can consume five pounds of oats per meal. He feeds his horses twice a day. If one bag contains 50-pounds of oats,  how many bags of oats does he need to fed his horses for five days?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Ivar owns a stable. He recently has 3 horses and each horse consumes 5 liters of water for drinking and 2 liters for bathing per day. If he added 5 horses, how many liters of water does Ivar need for all the horses for 28 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total amount of water consumed by one horse per day. Each horse consumes 5 liters of water for drinking and 2 liters for bathing per day, so the total amount of water consumed by one horse per day is 5 + 2 = 7 liters. Next, we need to calculate the total amount of water consumed by all the horses per day. Ivar has 3 horses, so the total amount of water consumed by all the horses per day is 3 x 7 = 21 liters. If he added 5 more horses, he would have a total of 3 + 5 = 8 horses. So, the total amount of water consumed by all the horses per day with 8 horses is 8 x 7 = 56 liters. Finally, we need to calculate the total amount of water needed for all the horses for 28 days. The total amount of water needed for all the horses for 28 days is 28 x 56 = 1,568 liters. Therefore, Ivar needs 1,568 liters of water for all the horses for 28 days. The answer is 28.\n\n\nQ: Janet uses her horses' manure as fertilizer. One horse produces 5 gallons of fertilizer per day. Once Janet has collected enough fertilizer, she'll spread it over 20 acres of farmland. Each acre needs 400 gallons of fertilizer and Janet can spread fertilizer over 4 acres per day. If Janet has 80 horses, how long will it take until all her fields are fertilized?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much fertilizer is needed for all 20 acres. Since each acre needs 400 gallons of fertilizer, we can multiply 20 acres by 400 gallons per acre to get: 20 acres x 400 gallons per acre = 8,000 gallons of fertilizer Next, we need to figure out how many days it will take Janet to spread all the fertilizer. Since she can spread fertilizer over 4 acres per day, we can divide the total number of acres by 4 to get: 20 acres \u00f7 4 acres per day = 5 days So it will take Janet 5 days to spread all the fertilizer. Now we need to figure out how much fertilizer she can collect each day. Since each horse produces 5 gallons of fertilizer per day, and she has 80 horses, we can multiply 5 gallons per horse by 80 horses to get: 5 gallons per horse x 80 horses = 400 gallons of fertilizer per day So Janet can collect 400 gallons of fertilizer per day. Finally, we can divide the total amount of fertilizer needed by the amount of fertilizer she can collect per day to get: 8,000 gallons of fertilizer \u00f7 400 gallons per day = 20 days So it will take Janet 20 days to collect enough fertilizer to fertilize all her fields. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much milk one cow produces in a week. We can do this by dividing the total amount of milk produced in 5 weeks (2160 liters) by the number of weeks (5) and the number of cows (x): 2160 = 6x * 108 * 5 2160 = 540x x = 4 Therefore, there are 4 cows on the farm. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Harris feeds his dog 1 large organic carrot over the course of 1 day.  There are 5 carrots in a 1 pound bag and each bag costs $2.00.  In one year, how much will Harris spend on carrots?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many pounds of carrots Harris will need in a year. Since he feeds his dog 1 carrot per day, he will need 365 carrots in a year. Next, we need to figure out how many bags of carrots he will need. If there are 5 carrots in a bag, then he will need 365/5 = 73 bags of carrots in a year. Finally, we can calculate the cost of the carrots. Each bag costs $2.00, so 73 bags will cost 73 x $2.00 = $146.00. Therefore, Harris will spend $146.00 on carrots in one year. The answer is 146.\n\n\nQ: John takes a pill every 6 hours.  How many pills does he take a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 24 hours in a day, so John takes 24/6 = 4 pills per day. In a week, there are 7 days, so John takes 4 x 7 = 28 pills per week. The answer is 28.\n\n\nQ: Herman likes to feed the birds in December, January and February.  He feeds them 1/2 cup in the morning and 1/2 cup in the afternoon.  How many cups of food will he need for all three months?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days there are in December, January, and February. December has 31 days, January has 31 days, and February has 28 days (or 29 in a leap year). Next, we need to find out how many times Herman feeds the birds in a day. He feeds them 1/2 cup in the morning and 1/2 cup in the afternoon, so he feeds them a total of 1 cup per day. Now we can calculate how much food he needs for all three months. In one month, he feeds the birds for 31 days, so he needs 31 cups of food (1 cup per day). For all three months, he needs 31 cups x 3 months = 93 cups of food. The answer is 93.\n\n\nQ: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of 18 watermelons. Since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, the total weight of 18 watermelons would be: 23 x 18 = 414 pounds Next, we need to find the total amount of money Farmer Kent would make by selling these watermelons. Since he sells them for $2 a pound, we can multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 414 x $2 = $828 Therefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Sandra eats 3 beignets every morning.  How many beignets will she eat in 16 weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many beignets Sandra eats in one week. To do this, we can multiply the number of beignets she eats in one day (3) by the number of days in a week (7): 3 beignets/day x 7 days/week = 21 beignets/week So Sandra eats 21 beignets in one week. Next, we need to find out how many beignets she will eat in 16 weeks. To do this, we can multiply the number of beignets she eats in one week (21) by the number of weeks (16): 21 beignets/week x 16 weeks = 336 beignets Therefore, Sandra will eat 336 beignets in 16 weeks. The answer is 16.\n\n\n"
