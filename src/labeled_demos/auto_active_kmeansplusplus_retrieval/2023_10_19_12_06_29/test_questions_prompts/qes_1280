  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A water tower that serves four neighborhoods around it holds 1200 barrels of water and is filled to the top each week. If one neighborhood uses 150 barrels of water in a week, the second neighborhood uses twice as many barrels of water as the first neighborhood in a week, and the third neighborhood uses one hundred more barrels of water than the second neighborhood in a week, how many barrels are left for the fourth neighborhood?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many barrels of water the second neighborhood uses in a week. We know that the first neighborhood uses 150 barrels, so the second neighborhood uses twice as many, which is 150 x 2 = 300 barrels. Next, we need to find out how many barrels of water the third neighborhood uses in a week. We know that the third neighborhood uses 100 more barrels than the second neighborhood, so that's 300 + 100 = 400 barrels. Now, we can add up the barrels of water used by the first three neighborhoods: 150 + 300 + 400 = 850 barrels. We know that the water tower holds 1200 barrels of water and is filled to the top each week, so to find out how many barrels are left for the fourth neighborhood, we can subtract the barrels used by the first three neighborhoods from the total capacity of the water tower: 1200 - 850 = 350 barrels. Therefore, the fourth neighborhood has 350 barrels of water left for the week. The answer is 350.\n\n\nQ: John has a very inefficient toilet that uses 5 gallons of water per flush and his household flushed 15 times per day.  He replaced it with a toilet that uses 80% less water per flush.  How much water did John save in June?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much water John's old toilet used per day: 5 gallons/flush x 15 flushes/day = 75 gallons/day Next, let's calculate how much water John's new toilet uses per flush: 5 gallons/flush x 80% = 4 gallons/flush So, John's new toilet uses 4 gallons per flush. Now, let's calculate how much water John's new toilet uses per day: 4 gallons/flush x 15 flushes/day = 60 gallons/day Finally, let's calculate how much water John saved in June (assuming 30 days in June): Water saved per day = 75 gallons/day - 60 gallons/day = 15 gallons/day Water saved in June = 15 gallons/day x 30 days = 450 gallons Therefore, John saved 450 gallons of water in June by replacing his old toilet with a new, more efficient one. The answer is 450.\n\n\nQ: Claudia has 122 ounces of water and is filling up cups. She has 8-ounce glasses, 5-ounce glasses, and 4-ounce glasses. If she fills six 5 ounce glasses and four 8 ounce glasses, how many 4 ounce glasses can she fill with the remaining water?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much water Claudia has used so far. 6 x 5 = 30 ounces (for six 5-ounce glasses) 4 x 8 = 32 ounces (for four 8-ounce glasses) So, Claudia has used 30 + 32 = 62 ounces of water. Now, let's calculate how much water she has left. 122 - 62 = 60 ounces Finally, let's calculate how many 4-ounce glasses she can fill with the remaining water. 60 / 4 = 15 Therefore, Claudia can fill 15 4-ounce glasses with the remaining water. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many students are in Alice's class. We know that there are 40 students and 10 instructors, so the total number of people in the class is 40 + 10 = 50. Next, we need to figure out how many students are bringing their own life vests. We know that 20% of the students are bringing life vests, so we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of students by 0.2: 40 x 0.2 = 8. So 8 students are bringing their own life vests. Now we need to figure out how many life vests we still need. We have 20 life vests on hand, and we need one for each of the 50 people in the class. So we need 50 - 20 = 30 more life vests. However, we already know that 8 students are bringing their own life vests, so we can subtract those from the total number we need: 30 - 8 = 22. Therefore, Alice needs to get 22 more life vests so that the entire class has one. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: John takes a 10-minute shower every other day for 4 weeks. If his shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute.  How much water does he use in those 4 weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many showers John takes in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks is 4 x 7 = 28 days. Since John takes a shower every other day, he takes 28/2 = 14 showers in 4 weeks. Next, we need to find out how much water he uses per shower. John takes a 10-minute shower, and his shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute. So, he uses 10 x 2 = 20 gallons of water per shower. Finally, we can find out how much water he uses in 4 weeks by multiplying the amount of water per shower by the number of showers he takes: 20 gallons per shower x 14 showers = 280 gallons of water in 4 weeks. Therefore, John uses 280 gallons of water in those 4 weeks. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Forty percent of the students have elected to learn from home during the pandemic. The remaining students are divided into two equal groups, only one of which is physically in school on any day. What percent of students are present in school?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Let's assume that there are 100 students in total. Step 2: 40% of the students have elected to learn from home during the pandemic. So, the number of students learning from home is 40% of 100, which is 40. Step 3: The remaining students are 60 (100 - 40). Step 4: The remaining students are divided into two equal groups, so each group has 30 students. Step 5: Only one of the two groups is physically in school on any day. So, the number of students present in school is 30. Step 6: To find the percentage of students present in school, we need to divide the number of students present in school by the total number of students and multiply by 100. 30/100 x 100 = 30% Therefore, 30% of students are present in school. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: Ivar owns a stable. He recently has 3 horses and each horse consumes 5 liters of water for drinking and 2 liters for bathing per day. If he added 5 horses, how many liters of water does Ivar need for all the horses for 28 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total amount of water consumed by one horse per day. Each horse consumes 5 liters of water for drinking and 2 liters for bathing per day, so the total amount of water consumed by one horse per day is 5 + 2 = 7 liters. Next, we need to calculate the total amount of water consumed by all the horses per day. Ivar has 3 horses, so the total amount of water consumed by all the horses per day is 3 x 7 = 21 liters. If he added 5 more horses, he would have a total of 3 + 5 = 8 horses. So, the total amount of water consumed by all the horses per day with 8 horses is 8 x 7 = 56 liters. Finally, we need to calculate the total amount of water needed for all the horses for 28 days. The total amount of water needed for all the horses for 28 days is 28 x 56 = 1,568 liters. Therefore, Ivar needs 1,568 liters of water for all the horses for 28 days. The answer is 28.\n\n\nQ: Danny has 3 bottles of soda. He drinks 90% of one bottle and gives 70% of the other two bottles to his friends. How much soda does Danny have left, expressed as a percentage of a bottle?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much soda Danny drank from one bottle. 90% of one bottle is 0.9 bottles. So now Danny has 3 - 0.9 = 2.1 bottles of soda left. Next, let's find out how much soda Danny gave to his friends. 70% of two bottles is 1.4 bottles. So now Danny has 2.1 - 1.4 = 0.7 bottles of soda left. Finally, let's express this as a percentage of a bottle. 0.7 bottles is 70% of one bottle. Therefore, Danny has 70% of a bottle of soda left. The answer is 70.\n\n\n"
