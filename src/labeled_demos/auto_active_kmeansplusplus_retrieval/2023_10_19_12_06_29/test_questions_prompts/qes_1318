  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Horatio is a poet composing sonnets for his lady fair. He believes it will take many of his sonnets to win her over. Each sonnet is fourteen lines long. His lady fair tells him to leave her alone after he reads her only seven sonnets, and Horatio is heartbroken over the 70 romantic lines he wrote that she never heard. How many sonnets did Horatio write in all?\nA: Let's think step by step. Horatio wrote 70 lines of poetry that his lady fair never heard. Since each sonnet is 14 lines long, we can divide the total number of lines by 14 to find out how many sonnets Horatio wrote. 70 \u00f7 14 = 5 Horatio wrote 5 sonnets in total. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour. Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour.  Oliver can read 40 pages.  How many pages can Carter read in 1 hour?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Oliver can read 40 pages in 1 hour. Next, we know that Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour, so Lucy can read 40 + 20 = 60 pages in 1 hour. Finally, we know that Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour, so Carter can read 60 / 2 = 30 pages in 1 hour. Therefore, Carter can read 30 pages in 1 hour. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: John is performing in 3 plays.  Each play has 5 Acts.  He wears 2 wigs per act.  Each wig cost $5.  He drops one of the plays and sells all of the wigs for that play for $4.  How much money did he spend?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many wigs John needs in total. Since he performs in 3 plays and each play has 5 acts, he needs 3 x 5 = 15 wigs in total. Next, we need to find out how much he spent on all the wigs. Since he wears 2 wigs per act, he needs 2 x 15 = 30 wigs in total. Each wig costs $5, so he spent 30 x $5 = $150 on all the wigs. Now, we need to find out how much money he made by selling the wigs from one of the plays. He sold all the wigs for $4 each, so he made 15 x $4 = $60. Finally, we need to subtract the money he made from the money he spent to find out how much money he spent in total. $150 - $60 = $90. Therefore, John spent $90 on all the wigs. The answer is 90.\n\n\nQ: John can play 200 beats per minute.  If he plays 2 hours a day for 3 days how many beats does he play?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many minutes John plays in total. Since he plays for 2 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, he plays for 2 x 60 = 120 minutes per day. Therefore, over 3 days, he plays for a total of 120 x 3 = 360 minutes. Now we need to find out how many beats he plays in total. If he plays 200 beats per minute, then in 360 minutes he plays 200 x 360 = 72,000 beats. So John plays 72,000 beats over the course of 3 days. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Seal releases 3 songs every month.  He gets $2000 per song.  How much money does he get in his first 3 years?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many songs Seal releases in 3 years. There are 12 months in a year, so in 3 years, there are 12 x 3 = 36 months. Since Seal releases 3 songs every month, he releases 3 x 36 = 108 songs in 3 years. Now, we can find out how much money he makes from these songs. He gets $2000 per song, so he makes 2000 x 108 = $216,000 in 3 years. Therefore, Seal makes $216,000 in his first 3 years. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: A performing magician has a disappearing act where he makes a random member of his audience disappear and reappear. Unfortunately, one-tenth of the time, the audience member never reappears. However, one-fifth of the time, two people reappear instead of only one. If the magician has put on 100 performances of the act this year, how many people have reappeared?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people disappear in total. Since the magician chooses a random member of the audience each time, we can assume that one person disappears per performance. Therefore, 100 people have disappeared in total. Next, we need to find out how many times one person reappears. We know that one-tenth of the time, the person never reappears, so that means nine-tenths of the time, they do reappear. Therefore, 90 people have reappeared once. Finally, we need to find out how many times two people reappear. We know that one-fifth of the time, this happens. Since there were 100 performances in total, this means that 20 times, two people reappeared. Therefore, 40 people have reappeared twice. To find the total number of people who have reappeared, we add the number of people who have reappeared once to the number of people who have reappeared twice: 90 + 40 = 130 Therefore, 130 people have reappeared in total. The answer is 130.\n\n\nQ: Enrique has 2 132 contracts that he needs to shred.  His paper shredder will only allow him to shred 6 pages at a time.  How many times will he shred 6 units of paper until all of the contracts are shredded?\nA: Let's think step by step. Enrique has 2 contracts, each with 132 pages. So, he has a total of 2 x 132 = 264 pages to shred. Enrique can shred 6 pages at a time. To find out how many times he needs to shred 6 pages to shred all 264 pages, we can divide 264 by 6: 264 \u00f7 6 = 44 So, Enrique will need to shred 6 pages 44 times to shred all 264 pages. The answer is 264.\n\n\nQ: Nine hundred tickets were sold to a concert. Three-fourths of those who bought the ticket came before the start of the concert. Five-ninths of the remaining came few minutes after the first song. Eighty people arrived during the middle part of the concert while the rest did not go. How many of those who bought the tickets did not go?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many people came before the start of the concert. Three-fourths of 900 tickets = (3/4) x 900 = 675 people came before the start of the concert. Step 2: Find out how many people were left after the first group came. 900 - 675 = 225 people were left. Step 3: Find out how many people came few minutes after the first song. Five-ninths of the remaining 225 people = (5/9) x 225 = 125 people came few minutes after the first song. Step 4: Find out how many people were left after the second group came. 225 - 125 = 100 people were left. Step 5: Subtract the number of people who arrived during the middle part of the concert from the number of people left. 100 - 80 = 20 people did not go to the concert. Therefore, 20 people who bought the tickets did not go to the concert. The answer is 20.\n\n\n"
