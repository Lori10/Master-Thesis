  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A flower shop sells bouquets of roses, which each contain 12 roses, and bouquets of daisies, which each contain an equal amount of daisies. The flower shop sells 20 bouquets today. 10 of these were rose bouquets and the remaining 10 bouquets were daisy bouquets. If the flower shop has sold 190 flowers in total today, how many daisies are in each bouquet of daisies?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the flower shop sold 10 bouquets of roses, each containing 12 roses, so they sold a total of 10 x 12 = 120 roses. Next, we know that the flower shop sold 10 bouquets of daisies, and we want to find out how many daisies are in each bouquet. Let's call the number of daisies in each bouquet \"d\". So, the flower shop sold a total of 10 x d = 10d daisies. We also know that the flower shop sold a total of 190 flowers in total today, so: 120 (roses) + 10d (daisies) = 190 Simplifying this equation, we get: 10d = 70 Dividing both sides by 10, we get: d = 7 Therefore, each bouquet of daisies contains 7 daisies. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Blanche, Rose and Dorothy liked to collect sea glass when they went to the beach.  Blanche found 12 pieces of green and 3 pieces of red sea glass.  Rose found 9 pieces of red and 11 pieces of blue sea glass.  If Dorothy found twice as many pieces of red glass as Blanche and Rose and three times as much blue sea glass as Rose, how many pieces did Dorothy have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many pieces of red sea glass Blanche and Rose found combined. Blanche found 3 pieces of red sea glass and Rose found 9 pieces of red sea glass, so together they found 3 + 9 = 12 pieces of red sea glass. Next, let's find out how many pieces of blue sea glass Rose found. Rose found 11 pieces of blue sea glass. Now, let's use the information given to find out how many pieces of red and blue sea glass Dorothy found. We know that Dorothy found twice as many pieces of red sea glass as Blanche and Rose combined, which is 2 * 12 = 24 pieces of red sea glass. We also know that Dorothy found three times as much blue sea glass as Rose, which is 3 * 11 = 33 pieces of blue sea glass. Finally, we can add up all the pieces of sea glass that Dorothy found: 24 pieces of red sea glass + 33 pieces of blue sea glass = 57 pieces of sea glass in total. Therefore, Dorothy found 57 pieces of sea glass. The answer is 57.\n\n\nQ: Last night Kannon had 3 apples, a banana, and 4 oranges for dinner. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, and twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today. How many fruits would she have eaten so far in the two meals?\nA: Let's think step by step. Last night Kannon had 3 apples, 1 banana, and 4 oranges, so she had a total of 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 fruits. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, which means she will have 3 + 4 = 7 apples today. She is also planning to have 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, which means she will have 1 x 10 = 10 bananas today. Finally, she is planning to have twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today, which means she will have 7 x 2 = 14 oranges today. Therefore, in total, Kannon will have eaten 7 + 10 + 14 = 31 fruits in the two meals. The answer is 31.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Fran\u00e7oise sells pots of lily of the valley to fund humanitarian work. She buys them at \u20ac12 each and sells them at a 25% higher cost. How much will she give back to the association by selling 150 pots of lily of the valley?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the selling price of each pot of lily of the valley. Fran\u00e7oise sells them at a 25% higher cost than the buying price of \u20ac12, so we need to add 25% of \u20ac12 to \u20ac12: 25% of \u20ac12 = 0.25 x \u20ac12 = \u20ac3 Selling price = \u20ac12 + \u20ac3 = \u20ac15 Now we know that Fran\u00e7oise sells each pot of lily of the valley for \u20ac15. To calculate how much she will give back to the association by selling 150 pots, we need to multiply the selling price by the number of pots sold: \u20ac15 x 150 = \u20ac2250 Therefore, Fran\u00e7oise will give back \u20ac2250 to the association by selling 150 pots of lily of the valley. The answer is 150.\n\n\nQ: Seth bought some boxes of oranges. He gave a box to his mother. He then gave away half of the remaining boxes. If Seth has 4 boxes of oranges left, how many boxes did he buy in the first place?\nA: Let's think step by step. 1. Seth gave a box to his mother, so he had x-1 boxes left. 2. He then gave away half of the remaining boxes, which means he gave away (x-1)/2 boxes. 3. After giving away half of the remaining boxes, he had 4 boxes left. So, we can set up an equation: (x-1)/2 = x-4 4. Solving for x, we can simplify the equation: x-1 = 2(x-4) -> x-1 = 2x-8 -> x = 7 Therefore, Seth bought 7 boxes of oranges in the first place. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: GiGi took out a big bowl of mushrooms from the refrigerator.  She cut each mushroom into 4 pieces.  Her twins, Kenny and Karla sprinkled mushrooms on their pizzas and baked them in the oven.  Kenny grabbed a handful and sprinkled 38 mushroom pieces on his pizza.  Karla scooped them up with both hands and sprinkled 42 mushroom pieces on her pizza.  On the cutting board, were 8 pieces of mushrooms remaining.  How many mushrooms did GiGi cut up at the beginning?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that GiGi cut up a certain number of mushrooms into 4 pieces each. Let's call the total number of mushrooms she cut up \"x\". Next, we know that Kenny sprinkled 38 mushroom pieces on his pizza. Since each mushroom was cut into 4 pieces, this means he used 38/4 = 9.5 mushrooms. However, since he can't use half a mushroom, we know he used 9 mushrooms. Similarly, Karla used 42/4 = 10.5 mushrooms, but since she can't use half a mushroom, we know she used 10 mushrooms. So far, we know that Kenny and Karla used a total of 9+10 = 19 mushrooms. Finally, we know that there were 8 pieces of mushrooms left on the cutting board. Since each mushroom was cut into 4 pieces, this means there were 8/4 = 2 mushrooms left. To find the total number of mushrooms GiGi cut up at the beginning, we can add up the number of mushrooms used by Kenny and Karla, plus the number of mushrooms left on the cutting board: x = 19 + 2 = 21 Therefore, GiGi cut up 21 mushrooms at the beginning. The answer is 21.\n\n\n"
