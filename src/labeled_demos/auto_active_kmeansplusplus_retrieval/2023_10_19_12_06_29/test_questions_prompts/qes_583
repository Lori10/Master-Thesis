  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The number of goals scored in a game against Barca by exactly two players last season accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league. If the players scored an equal number of goals, and the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300, calculate the number of goals each of the two players scored.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the number of goals scored by the two players accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league against Barca. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 0.2 * total goals in the league against Barca = number of goals scored by the two players We also know that the two players scored an equal number of goals, so we can let x be the number of goals each player scored. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as: 0.2 * 300 = 2x Simplifying the equation, we get: 60 = 2x Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 30 Therefore, each player scored 30 goals. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Bertha started with two balls and gave one to her partner, so she has one ball left. Next, we need to figure out how many balls she loses and how many wear out. In 20 games, she loses 20/5 = 4 balls and 20/10 = 2 balls wear out. Finally, we need to figure out how many balls she buys. In 20 games, she buys 20/4 = 5 canisters of three balls, which is a total of 5*3 = 15 balls. So, in total, Bertha has 1 (starting ball) - 4 (lost balls) - 2 (worn out balls) + 15 (bought balls) = 10 tennis balls. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Jordan is a hockey goalie. In the first period of a game, he blocked four shots. In the second period, he blocked twice as many shots. In the third period, he blocked three fewer than in the second period. When the game ended after the fourth period, he had blocked 21 shots in all. How many did Jordan block in the fourth period?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Jordan blocked 4 shots in the first period. In the second period, he blocked twice as many shots as in the first period, so he blocked 4 x 2 = 8 shots. In the third period, he blocked three fewer than in the second period, so he blocked 8 - 3 = 5 shots. We know that he blocked a total of 21 shots in all four periods, so we can set up an equation: 4 + 8 + 5 + x = 21 where x is the number of shots he blocked in the fourth period. Simplifying the equation: 17 + x = 21 Subtracting 17 from both sides: x = 4 Therefore, Jordan blocked 4 shots in the fourth period. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: James writes a comic every other day for 4 years. If there was no leap year, how many comics has he written?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days there are in 4 years. Since there are 365 days in a year, we can multiply 365 by 4 to get: 365 x 4 = 1460 days Next, we need to figure out how many comics James writes in every other day. Since he writes a comic every other day, we can divide the total number of days by 2 to get: 1460 / 2 = 730 comics Therefore, James has written 730 comics in 4 years if there was no leap year. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: A soccer team had 24 players prepared for a soccer game. The first half saw 11 players start the game with 2 substitutions made. In the second half, the team made twice as many substitutions as it made in the first half. How many players on the team did not play that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many players played in the first half. We know that 11 players started the game, and 2 substitutions were made, so a total of 13 players played in the first half. Next, we need to find out how many substitutions were made in the second half. We know that the team made twice as many substitutions as it made in the first half, so that means 2 x 2 = 4 substitutions were made in the second half. Now we can calculate how many players played in the second half. We know that there were 13 players who played in the first half, and 4 substitutions were made, so a total of 17 players played in the second half. Finally, we can calculate how many players did not play that day. We know that the team had 24 players prepared for the game, and 13 players played in the first half, and 17 players played in the second half. So, 24 - 13 - 17 = 4 players did not play that day. Therefore, there were 4 players on the team who did not play that day. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Karina was born in 1970 and she is currently twice as old as her brother. If her current age is 40, in what year was her brother born?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Karina's current age is 40. We also know that she is currently twice as old as her brother. Therefore, we can set up an equation: 40 = 2x where x is her brother's current age. Solving for x, we get: x = 20 So Karina's brother is currently 20 years old. Next, we need to figure out in what year he was born. We know that Karina was born in 1970, so we can subtract her brother's age from that year: 1970 - 20 = 1950 Therefore, Karina's brother was born in 1950. The answer is 1950.\n\n\nQ: An archer needs to practice.  He intends to shoot 200 shots 4 days a week.  He is able to recover 20% of his arrows.  The arrows he uses cost $5.5 per arrow.  His team agrees to pay for 70% of the cost of his arrows.  How much does he spend for arrows a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many arrows the archer uses in a week. He shoots 200 arrows per day, 4 days a week, so he shoots a total of 200 x 4 = 800 arrows per week. Next, we need to find out how many arrows he is able to recover. He is able to recover 20% of his arrows, which is 0.2 x 800 = 160 arrows. So, he actually uses 800 - 160 = 640 arrows per week. Now, we can calculate the cost of the arrows he uses. Each arrow costs $5.5, so the total cost of the arrows he uses is 640 x $5.5 = $3520. Finally, we need to find out how much he actually spends on arrows per week, taking into account that his team pays for 70% of the cost. His team pays for 70% of $3520, which is 0.7 x $3520 = $2464. Therefore, the archer spends $3520 - $2464 = $1056 on arrows per week. The answer is 1056.\n\n\n"
