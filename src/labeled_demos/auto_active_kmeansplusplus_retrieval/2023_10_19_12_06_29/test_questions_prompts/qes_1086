  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Maria wants to paint a picture and needs some tools to do that. She wants to buy a set of brushes for $20 and some canvas for three times more than the brushes. The paint costs Maria $8 per liter, and she needs at least 5 liters. How much money will she earn on the painting if she will be able to sell it for $200?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much Maria will spend on canvas. We know that the canvas will cost three times more than the brushes, which are $20. So, 3 x $20 = $60 for the canvas. Next, let's calculate how much Maria will spend on paint. She needs at least 5 liters, and each liter costs $8. So, 5 x $8 = $40 for the paint. Now, let's add up all of Maria's expenses: $20 for brushes + $60 for canvas + $40 for paint = $120 total expenses. If Maria sells the painting for $200, she will earn $200 - $120 = $80 profit. The answer is 80.\n\n\nQ: Danielle bought a new house for $280k. She paid a $40k deposit on the house, and pays the rest using a mortgage that is spread out over 10 years. Danielle makes equal payments every month and at the end of the 10 years, the entire balance will be paid off. How much, in thousands of dollars, does Danielle pay each month?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much Danielle still owes on the house after paying the $40k deposit. $280k - $40k = $240k Next, we need to figure out how many months there are in 10 years. 10 years x 12 months/year = 120 months Finally, we can divide the remaining balance by the number of months to find out how much Danielle pays each month. $240k \u00f7 120 months = $2000/month Therefore, Danielle pays $2000 per month towards her mortgage. The answer is 2000.\n\n\nQ: Carson runs a carpool for five of his friends. The five of them cover all the gas expenses to compensate Carson for his time. Their total commute is 21 miles one way, gas costs $2.50/gallon, Carson's car gets 30 miles/gallon, and they commute to work 5 days a week, 4 weeks a month. How much does each person pay toward gas monthly?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per day. Since they commute 21 miles one way, their round trip is 21 x 2 = 42 miles. Next, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per week. They commute 42 miles per day, and they commute 5 days a week, so they commute 42 x 5 = 210 miles per week. Then, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per month. They commute 210 miles per week, and they commute 4 weeks a month, so they commute 210 x 4 = 840 miles per month. Now, we need to find out how many gallons of gas they need per month. Carson's car gets 30 miles per gallon, and they commute 840 miles per month, so they need 840/30 = 28 gallons of gas per month. Finally, we need to find out how much each person pays toward gas monthly. The total cost of gas is $2.50 per gallon, and they need 28 gallons of gas per month, so the total cost of gas is 2.5 x 28 = $70 per month. Since there are 6 people in the carpool (Carson and his 5 friends), each person pays 70/6 = $11.67 toward gas monthly. The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: Mitch has saved $20000 to finance his boating hobby. A new boat costs $1500 per foot in length. If Mitch needs to keep $500 for a license and registration, and three times that amount for docking fees, how many feet is the longest boat he can buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to subtract the amount Mitch needs to keep for license and registration and docking fees from his total savings: $20,000 - $500 - (3 x $500) = $18,500 Next, we need to divide this amount by the cost per foot of the boat: $18,500 \u00f7 $1500/ft = 12.33 ft Since we can't buy a fraction of a foot, we need to round down to the nearest whole number: The longest boat Mitch can buy is 12 feet long. The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: A factory decides to stop making cars and start making motorcycles instead. When it made cars, per month, it cost $100 for materials, they could make 4 cars, and they sold each car for $50. Now that they make motorcycles it costs $250 for materials, but they sell 8 of them for $50 each. How much more profit do they make per month selling motorcycles instead of cars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the profit made per car: Revenue per car = $50 Cost per car = $100/4 = $25 Profit per car = Revenue per car - Cost per car = $50 - $25 = $25 Now, let's calculate the profit made per motorcycle: Revenue per motorcycle = $50 x 8 = $400 Cost per motorcycle = $250 Profit per motorcycle = Revenue per motorcycle - Cost per motorcycle = $400 - $250 = $150 Finally, let's calculate the difference in profit between making cars and making motorcycles: Profit difference = Profit per motorcycle - Profit per car = $150 - $25 = $125 Therefore, the factory makes $125 more profit per month by making motorcycles instead of cars. The answer is 125.\n\n\nQ: Briar is attending a one-week community empowerment event and has to take a cab ride to the event and back home every day. A cab ride costs $2.5 per mile. If the event is 200 miles away from Briar's home, calculate the total amount of money the cab rides cost would be at the end of the event?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total distance Briar will travel during the event. Since Briar has to travel to the event and back home every day, the total distance he will travel in a day is 2 times the distance between his home and the event, which is 2*200 = 400 miles. Next, we need to calculate the total distance Briar will travel during the entire event, which is 400 miles per day multiplied by the number of days in the event. If the event is one week long, then the number of days is 7. Therefore, the total distance Briar will travel during the event is 400*7 = 2800 miles. Finally, we can calculate the total cost of the cab rides by multiplying the total distance by the cost per mile. The cost per mile is $2.5, so the total cost of the cab rides is 2800*$2.5 = $7000. Therefore, the total amount of money the cab rides cost would be at the end of the event is $7000. The answer is 7000.\n\n\nQ: Harris feeds his dog 1 large organic carrot over the course of 1 day.  There are 5 carrots in a 1 pound bag and each bag costs $2.00.  In one year, how much will Harris spend on carrots?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many pounds of carrots Harris will need in a year. Since he feeds his dog 1 carrot per day, he will need 365 carrots in a year. Next, we need to figure out how many bags of carrots he will need. If there are 5 carrots in a bag, then he will need 365/5 = 73 bags of carrots in a year. Finally, we can calculate the cost of the carrots. Each bag costs $2.00, so 73 bags will cost 73 x $2.00 = $146.00. Therefore, Harris will spend $146.00 on carrots in one year. The answer is 146.\n\n\nQ: Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how much money Carl will earn in four weeks. If he earns $0.50 every time, and he buys a candy bar each time, that means he's spending $0.50 each week. But he's also earning $0.75 each week for taking out his neighbor's trash. So his net earnings each week are $0.75 - $0.50 = $0.25. Over four weeks, that's a total of $0.25 x 4 = $1. So Carl will have $1 to spend on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.50, he can buy 2 candy bars with his earnings. The answer is 2.\n\n\n"
