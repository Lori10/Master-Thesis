  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Jeremy buys 30 watermelons. He eats 3 watermelons per week. Each week he gives 2 to his dad. How many weeks will the watermelons last?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many watermelons Jeremy eats per week and how many he gives to his dad. Jeremy eats 3 watermelons per week and gives 2 to his dad, so he uses a total of 5 watermelons per week. Next, we need to divide the total number of watermelons by the number of watermelons used per week to find out how many weeks the watermelons will last. 30 watermelons \u00f7 5 watermelons per week = 6 weeks Therefore, the watermelons will last for 6 weeks. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of 18 watermelons. Since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, the total weight of 18 watermelons would be: 23 x 18 = 414 pounds Next, we need to find the total amount of money Farmer Kent would make by selling these watermelons. Since he sells them for $2 a pound, we can multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 414 x $2 = $828 Therefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Janet uses her horses' manure as fertilizer. One horse produces 5 gallons of fertilizer per day. Once Janet has collected enough fertilizer, she'll spread it over 20 acres of farmland. Each acre needs 400 gallons of fertilizer and Janet can spread fertilizer over 4 acres per day. If Janet has 80 horses, how long will it take until all her fields are fertilized?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much fertilizer is needed for all 20 acres. Since each acre needs 400 gallons of fertilizer, we can multiply 20 acres by 400 gallons per acre to get: 20 acres x 400 gallons per acre = 8,000 gallons of fertilizer Next, we need to figure out how many days it will take Janet to spread all the fertilizer. Since she can spread fertilizer over 4 acres per day, we can divide the total number of acres by 4 to get: 20 acres \u00f7 4 acres per day = 5 days So it will take Janet 5 days to spread all the fertilizer. Now we need to figure out how much fertilizer she can collect each day. Since each horse produces 5 gallons of fertilizer per day, and she has 80 horses, we can multiply 5 gallons per horse by 80 horses to get: 5 gallons per horse x 80 horses = 400 gallons of fertilizer per day So Janet can collect 400 gallons of fertilizer per day. Finally, we can divide the total amount of fertilizer needed by the amount of fertilizer she can collect per day to get: 8,000 gallons of fertilizer \u00f7 400 gallons per day = 20 days So it will take Janet 20 days to collect enough fertilizer to fertilize all her fields. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: There are four growing trees. The first tree grows 1 meter/day, the second grows the same amount in half the time, the third grows 2 meters/day, and the fourth tree grows a meter more than the third each day. How many meters did the trees grow in total in 4 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much the second tree grows per day. Since it grows the same amount as the first tree in half the time, it grows 2 meters/day. Now we can calculate how much each tree grows in 4 days: - The first tree grows 1 meter/day, so in 4 days it grows 4 meters. - The second tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The third tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The fourth tree grows 1 meter more than the third each day, so it grows 3 meters/day. In 4 days it grows 12 meters. Adding up the growth of all four trees, we get: 4 + 8 + 8 + 12 = 32 meters Therefore, the trees grew a total of 32 meters in 4 days. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much milk one cow produces in a week. We can do this by dividing the total amount of milk produced in 5 weeks (2160 liters) by the number of weeks (5) and the number of cows (x): 2160 = 6x * 108 * 5 2160 = 540x x = 4 Therefore, there are 4 cows on the farm. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Last night Kannon had 3 apples, a banana, and 4 oranges for dinner. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, and twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today. How many fruits would she have eaten so far in the two meals?\nA: Let's think step by step. Last night Kannon had 3 apples, 1 banana, and 4 oranges, so she had a total of 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 fruits. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, which means she will have 3 + 4 = 7 apples today. She is also planning to have 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, which means she will have 1 x 10 = 10 bananas today. Finally, she is planning to have twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today, which means she will have 7 x 2 = 14 oranges today. Therefore, in total, Kannon will have eaten 7 + 10 + 14 = 31 fruits in the two meals. The answer is 31.\n\n\nQ: John can play 200 beats per minute.  If he plays 2 hours a day for 3 days how many beats does he play?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many minutes John plays in total. Since he plays for 2 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, he plays for 2 x 60 = 120 minutes per day. Therefore, over 3 days, he plays for a total of 120 x 3 = 360 minutes. Now we need to find out how many beats he plays in total. If he plays 200 beats per minute, then in 360 minutes he plays 200 x 360 = 72,000 beats. So John plays 72,000 beats over the course of 3 days. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: John takes a pill every 6 hours.  How many pills does he take a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 24 hours in a day, so John takes 24/6 = 4 pills per day. In a week, there are 7 days, so John takes 4 x 7 = 28 pills per week. The answer is 28.\n\n\n"
