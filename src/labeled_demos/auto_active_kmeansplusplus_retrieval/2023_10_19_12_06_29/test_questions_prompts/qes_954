  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A car driving cross-country traveled 180 miles in 4 hours. At this rate of speed, how many miles further will the car travel in the next 3 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the car's speed in miles per hour (mph). To do this, we divide the distance traveled by the time taken: Speed = Distance \u00f7 Time Speed = 180 miles \u00f7 4 hours Speed = 45 mph Now that we know the car's speed, we can use it to calculate how far it will travel in the next 3 hours: Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time Distance = 45 mph \u00d7 3 hours Distance = 135 miles Therefore, the car will travel 135 miles further in the next 3 hours. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Colin ran his first mile in 6 minutes.  He ran his next two miles in 5 minutes each and finished his 4th mile in 4 minutes.  What was the average time it took him to run a mile?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total time it took Colin to run all four miles. - Colin's first mile took 6 minutes. - His next two miles took 5 minutes each, so that's a total of 10 minutes. - His fourth mile took 4 minutes. To find the total time, we add these up: 6 + 10 + 4 = 20 So Colin ran four miles in a total of 20 minutes. To find the average time it took him to run a mile, we divide the total time by the number of miles: 20 / 4 = 5 So Colin's average time to run a mile was 5 minutes. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Yvonne swims 10 laps in 5 minutes.  Her younger sister can swim half as many laps as Yvonne in the same time frame.  Their brother Joel can swim three times the number of laps as the youngest sister.  How many laps can Joel swim?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many laps Yvonne's younger sister can swim in 5 minutes. Since she can swim half as many laps as Yvonne, we can divide Yvonne's number of laps by 2: Yvonne's sister = 10 laps / 2 = 5 laps Next, we need to figure out how many laps Joel can swim. We know that he can swim three times the number of laps as the youngest sister, so we can multiply her number of laps by 3: Joel = 5 laps * 3 = 15 laps Therefore, Joel can swim 15 laps in 5 minutes. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Timmy, Tommy and Tina are filling up a kiddie pool in their backyard.  Each has a pail they fill with water from a house before dumping it into the pool.  If Timmy's pail holds twice as much water as Tommy's, and Tommy's holds 2 gallons more than Tina's, and Tina's is 4 gallons, how much water do the three of them fill the pool with after 3 trips each?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much water each pail can hold. We know that Tina's pail holds 4 gallons. Tommy's pail holds 2 more gallons than Tina's, so it holds 4 + 2 = 6 gallons. Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's, so it holds 6 x 2 = 12 gallons. Now we know how much water each pail can hold, we can figure out how much water they can fill the pool with after 1 trip each. Together, they can fill the pool with 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 gallons of water. After 3 trips each, they will have filled the pool with 22 x 3 = 66 gallons of water. The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: Billy and Tiffany are having a contest to see how can run the most miles in a week. On Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, Billy runs 1 mile each day and Tiffany runs 2 miles each day. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, Billy runs 1 mile each day and Tiffany runs a 1/3 of a mile each day. On Saturday Tiffany assumes she's going to win and takes the day off. How many miles does Billy have to run on Saturday to tie Tiffany?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how many miles Billy and Tiffany run from Sunday to Friday: Billy: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 miles Tiffany: 2 + 2 + 2 + 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 6 2/3 miles So, by Friday, Tiffany is ahead by 2/3 of a mile. To tie Tiffany, Billy needs to run 2/3 of a mile on Saturday. Therefore, Billy needs to run 0.67 miles on Saturday to tie Tiffany. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Carlos and Diego are racing around the block. Carlos runs around the entire block in 3 minutes. Diego runs around half the block in 2.5 minutes and then is tripped by a dog and can't finish. Assuming he kept up the same speed the entire race, what would've been the average time in seconds for the racers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Diego to run the entire block. Since he runs half the block in 2.5 minutes, we can use proportion to find out: 2.5 minutes = 1/2 block x minutes = 1 block Cross-multiplying, we get: 2.5 * 2 = x * 1 5 = x So it would take Diego 5 minutes to run the entire block if he hadn't been tripped. Now we can find the average time for the racers. We add up the time it took Carlos and the time it would've taken Diego, and divide by the number of racers: (3 minutes + 5 minutes) / 2 racers = 4 minutes But the question asks for the answer in seconds, so we need to convert minutes to seconds: 4 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 240 seconds So the average time for the racers would've been 240 seconds. The answer is 240.\n\n\nQ: To get to an island called \"Virgo\", Tom needs to travel by plane and then by boat. The plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, and the boat trip takes up to 2 hours. In how many hours is Tom able to get to the \"Virgo\" island?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long the plane trip is. We know that the plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, so we can set up an equation: plane trip = 4 * boat trip Since we know the boat trip takes 2 hours, we can substitute that in: plane trip = 4 * 2 plane trip = 8 So the plane trip is 8 hours. Now we just need to add the plane trip and the boat trip together to find the total time: total time = plane trip + boat trip total time = 8 + 2 total time = 10 So Tom is able to get to the \"Virgo\" island in 10 hours. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Some friends went hiking for 3.5 hours. They traveled 21 kilometers in that time. Birgit was 4 minutes/km faster than the average time. If Birgit kept the same pace, how many minutes would it take her to go 8 kilometers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the average speed of the group. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken: Average speed = distance/time = 21 km/3.5 hours = 6 km/hour Next, we need to find Birgit's speed. We know that she was 4 minutes/km faster than the average time, which means she completed each kilometer in (60-4) = 56 minutes. So her speed was: Birgit's speed = 1 km/56 minutes = 0.018 km/minute Finally, we need to find how long it would take Birgit to travel 8 kilometers at this speed. We can use the formula: Time = distance/speed Time = 8 km / 0.018 km/minute = 444.44 minutes So it would take Birgit approximately 444.44 minutes to travel 8 kilometers at the same pace. The answer is 8.\n\n\n"
