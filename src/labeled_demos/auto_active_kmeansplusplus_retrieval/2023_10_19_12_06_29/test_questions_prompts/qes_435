  "test_question": "Q: John and Jack have 30 minutes to walk to school together. It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is. It takes them another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. How much longer do they have to get to school without being late?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Jessica just got her driving permit. She must complete 50 hours of driving with a parent to get her driver\u2019s license. It takes 20 minutes to drive to school. If she drives to and from school every day, how many school days will it take Jessica to meet the 50-hour driving requirement?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much time Jessica spends driving to and from school each day. She drives to school and back, so that's a total of 2 trips. Each trip takes 20 minutes, so she spends 40 minutes driving to and from school each day. Next, we need to figure out how many minutes of driving Jessica needs to complete in order to reach the 50-hour requirement. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 50 hours is equal to 50 x 60 = 3000 minutes. Now we can divide the total minutes of driving required by the number of minutes Jessica spends driving each day: 3000 / 40 = 75. So Jessica needs to drive for 75 school days in order to complete the 50-hour driving requirement. The answer is 50.\n\n\nQ: It takes 15 minutes for Dante to go to Hidden Lake. From Hidden Lake, he has to walk back to the Park Office and it takes him 7 minutes. When he arrives there, he will have been gone from the Park Office 32 minutes altogether. If he had walked to the Lake Park restaurant from the Park office before taking the 15 minute walk to Hidden Lake, how long is the walk from Park Office to the Lake Park restaurant?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Dante takes 15 minutes to walk to Hidden Lake and 7 minutes to walk back to the Park Office. So, he spends a total of 15 + 7 = 22 minutes walking to and from Hidden Lake. Next, we know that when Dante arrives back at the Park Office, he has been gone for a total of 32 minutes. This means that he spent 32 - 22 = 10 minutes walking to the Lake Park restaurant before going to Hidden Lake. Therefore, the walk from the Park Office to the Lake Park restaurant is 10 minutes. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Carlos and Diego are racing around the block. Carlos runs around the entire block in 3 minutes. Diego runs around half the block in 2.5 minutes and then is tripped by a dog and can't finish. Assuming he kept up the same speed the entire race, what would've been the average time in seconds for the racers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Diego to run the entire block. Since he runs half the block in 2.5 minutes, we can use proportion to find out: 2.5 minutes = 1/2 block x minutes = 1 block Cross-multiplying, we get: 2.5 * 2 = x * 1 5 = x So it would take Diego 5 minutes to run the entire block if he hadn't been tripped. Now we can find the average time for the racers. We add up the time it took Carlos and the time it would've taken Diego, and divide by the number of racers: (3 minutes + 5 minutes) / 2 racers = 4 minutes But the question asks for the answer in seconds, so we need to convert minutes to seconds: 4 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 240 seconds So the average time for the racers would've been 240 seconds. The answer is 240.\n\n\nQ: Emery's family decides to travel for a weekend trip. They drive the first 100 miles in 1 hour. They stop at a McDonald's and then continue the rest of the journey for 300 miles. What's the total number of hours they traveled?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, they drove 100 miles in 1 hour. Then, they stopped at McDonald's, which we don't know how long it took. Finally, they continued the rest of the journey for 300 miles. So, the total distance they traveled is 100 + 300 = 400 miles. We know they drove the first 100 miles in 1 hour, but we don't know how long they stopped at McDonald's. Let's call that time \"x\". Then, they drove the remaining 300 miles. Let's call the time it took to drive that distance \"y\". So, the total time they traveled is: 1 hour (for the first 100 miles) + x (for the time they stopped at McDonald's) + y (for the remaining 300 miles) We don't know x or y, but we do know that the total time they traveled is the sum of those three values. Therefore, the answer is: Total time = 1 + x + y hours. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour. Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour.  Oliver can read 40 pages.  How many pages can Carter read in 1 hour?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Oliver can read 40 pages in 1 hour. Next, we know that Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour, so Lucy can read 40 + 20 = 60 pages in 1 hour. Finally, we know that Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour, so Carter can read 60 / 2 = 30 pages in 1 hour. Therefore, Carter can read 30 pages in 1 hour. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: The white rabbit can hop 15 meters in one minute. The brown rabbit hops 12 meters per minute. What is the total distance the two rabbits will hop in 5 minutes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how far the white rabbit can hop in 5 minutes. To do this, we can multiply its speed by the time: 15 meters/minute x 5 minutes = 75 meters So the white rabbit can hop 75 meters in 5 minutes. Next, we need to find out how far the brown rabbit can hop in 5 minutes. Again, we can multiply its speed by the time: 12 meters/minute x 5 minutes = 60 meters So the brown rabbit can hop 60 meters in 5 minutes. To find the total distance the two rabbits will hop in 5 minutes, we simply add their distances: 75 meters + 60 meters = 135 meters Therefore, the two rabbits will hop a total distance of 135 meters in 5 minutes. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: A train leaves its departure station with 6 coal cars, 12 iron cars, and 2 wood cars. Between each station, there are 6 miles, and it takes 25 minutes to travel between them. At each station, the train can deposit up to 2 coal cars, 3 iron cars, and 1 wood car. How many minutes will it take to deliver all the cars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find the total number of cars the train has: 6 coal cars + 12 iron cars + 2 wood cars = 20 cars Next, let's find the maximum number of cars the train can deposit at each station: 2 coal cars + 3 iron cars + 1 wood car = 6 cars To deliver all 20 cars, the train will need to make multiple trips between stations. For each trip, the train can deposit 6 cars. So, the number of trips the train will need to make is: 20 cars \u00f7 6 cars per trip = 3.33 trips Since the train cannot make a partial trip, it will need to make 4 trips. Each trip takes 25 minutes, so the total time it will take to deliver all the cars is: 4 trips x 25 minutes per trip = 100 minutes The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Jill can run up a hill at 9 feet/second and down a hill at 12 feet/second. How long does it take her to run up and down a 900 foot hill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for Jill to run up the hill. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed The distance she runs up the hill is 900 feet, and her speed is 9 feet/second. So: time up = 900 / 9 = 100 seconds Next, we need to find the time it takes for Jill to run down the hill. Again, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed The distance she runs down the hill is also 900 feet, but her speed is 12 feet/second. So: time down = 900 / 12 = 75 seconds Finally, we need to find the total time it takes for Jill to run up and down the hill. Since she runs up and down separately, we can just add the two times: total time = time up + time down = 100 + 75 = 175 seconds Therefore, it takes Jill 175 seconds to run up and down a 900 foot hill. The answer is 900.\n\n\n"
