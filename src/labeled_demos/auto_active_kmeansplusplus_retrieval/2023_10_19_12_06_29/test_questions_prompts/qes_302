  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Danielle bought a new house for $280k. She paid a $40k deposit on the house, and pays the rest using a mortgage that is spread out over 10 years. Danielle makes equal payments every month and at the end of the 10 years, the entire balance will be paid off. How much, in thousands of dollars, does Danielle pay each month?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much Danielle still owes on the house after paying the $40k deposit. $280k - $40k = $240k Next, we need to figure out how many months there are in 10 years. 10 years x 12 months/year = 120 months Finally, we can divide the remaining balance by the number of months to find out how much Danielle pays each month. $240k \u00f7 120 months = $2000/month Therefore, Danielle pays $2000 per month towards her mortgage. The answer is 2000.\n\n\nQ: Maria wants to paint a picture and needs some tools to do that. She wants to buy a set of brushes for $20 and some canvas for three times more than the brushes. The paint costs Maria $8 per liter, and she needs at least 5 liters. How much money will she earn on the painting if she will be able to sell it for $200?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much Maria will spend on canvas. We know that the canvas will cost three times more than the brushes, which are $20. So, 3 x $20 = $60 for the canvas. Next, let's calculate how much Maria will spend on paint. She needs at least 5 liters, and each liter costs $8. So, 5 x $8 = $40 for the paint. Now, let's add up all of Maria's expenses: $20 for brushes + $60 for canvas + $40 for paint = $120 total expenses. If Maria sells the painting for $200, she will earn $200 - $120 = $80 profit. The answer is 80.\n\n\nQ: Marco has $24. Mary has $15. If Marco gives Mary half of what he has, Mary will have more than Marco. But Mary spends $5. How much more money does Mary have than Marco?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much money Marco gives to Mary. Since Marco has $24, half of that would be $12. So, Marco gives $12 to Mary. After receiving $12 from Marco, Mary will have $15 + $12 = $27. However, Mary spends $5, so we need to subtract that from her total. $27 - $5 = $22. Therefore, Mary has $22 more than Marco. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Jamie and Oliver are planning to go on a vacation. A plane ticket costs $24 for each person and a hotel stay costs $12 for each person per day. How much money will they spend on the vacation if they stay for 3 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets for both Jamie and Oliver. Since each ticket costs $24, the total cost of the tickets will be: $24 x 2 = $48 Next, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel stay. Since the cost is $12 per person per day, and they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel stay will be: $12 x 2 x 3 = $72 Finally, we need to add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay to get the total cost of the vacation: $48 + $72 = $120 Therefore, Jamie and Oliver will spend $120 on their vacation. The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: A math teacher had $100 to buy three different types of calculators. A basic calculator costs $8. A scientific calculator costs twice the price as the basic while a graphing calculator costs thrice the price as the scientific. How much change did she receive after buying those three different types of calculators?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many calculators of each type the teacher can buy with $100. Let's start with the basic calculator. Each basic calculator costs $8, so the teacher can buy 100/8 = 12.5 basic calculators. Since we can't buy half a calculator, we'll round down to 12 basic calculators. Next, let's figure out how many scientific calculators the teacher can buy. Each scientific calculator costs twice as much as a basic calculator, so it costs $8 x 2 = $16. With $100, the teacher can buy 100/16 = 6.25 scientific calculators. Again, we'll round down to 6 scientific calculators. Finally, let's figure out how many graphing calculators the teacher can buy. Each graphing calculator costs three times as much as a scientific calculator, so it costs $16 x 3 = $48. With $100, the teacher can buy 100/48 = 2.08 graphing calculators. We'll round down to 2 graphing calculators. So in total, the teacher can buy 12 basic calculators, 6 scientific calculators, and 2 graphing calculators. The cost of the basic calculators is 12 x $8 = $96. The cost of the scientific calculators is 6 x $16 = $96. The cost of the graphing calculators is 2 x $48 = $96. So the total cost of all the calculators is $96 + $96 + $96 = $288. The teacher started with $100, so she received $100 - $288 = -$188 in change. However, since she didn't have enough money to buy all the calculators she wanted, she actually owes $188. The answer is 188.\n\n\nQ: Mitch has saved $20000 to finance his boating hobby. A new boat costs $1500 per foot in length. If Mitch needs to keep $500 for a license and registration, and three times that amount for docking fees, how many feet is the longest boat he can buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to subtract the amount Mitch needs to keep for license and registration and docking fees from his total savings: $20,000 - $500 - (3 x $500) = $18,500 Next, we need to divide this amount by the cost per foot of the boat: $18,500 \u00f7 $1500/ft = 12.33 ft Since we can't buy a fraction of a foot, we need to round down to the nearest whole number: The longest boat Mitch can buy is 12 feet long. The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of 18 watermelons. Since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, the total weight of 18 watermelons would be: 23 x 18 = 414 pounds Next, we need to find the total amount of money Farmer Kent would make by selling these watermelons. Since he sells them for $2 a pound, we can multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 414 x $2 = $828 Therefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Joseph has a refrigerator, a water heater in his house, and an electric oven that consumes power at different rates. The total amount of money that Joseph pays for the energy used by the refrigerator is three times the amount he pays for the power used by the water heater. If the electric oven uses power worth $500 in a month, twice what Joseph pays for the power the water heater uses, calculate the total amount he pays for the power used by these gadgets.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much Joseph pays for the power used by the water heater. We know that the electric oven uses power worth $500 in a month, twice what Joseph pays for the power the water heater uses. So, if the power used by the water heater is x, then we can write: 2x = $500 Solving for x, we get: x = $250 Now we know that Joseph pays $250 for the power used by the water heater. We also know that the total amount of money that Joseph pays for the energy used by the refrigerator is three times the amount he pays for the power used by the water heater. So, if the power used by the water heater is x, then the power used by the refrigerator is 3x. Therefore, the total amount Joseph pays for the power used by these gadgets is: $250 + $500 + 3x Substituting x = $250, we get: $250 + $500 + 3($250) = $1,500 Therefore, Joseph pays a total of $1,500 for the power used by the refrigerator, water heater, and electric oven. The answer is 1500.\n\n\n"
