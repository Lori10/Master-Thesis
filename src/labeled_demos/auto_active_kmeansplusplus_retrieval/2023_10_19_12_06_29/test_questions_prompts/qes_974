  "test_question": "Q: Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then decides to go to bed and reads for half as long.  He does this 3 times a week.  How many hours does he spend on TV and reading in 4 weeks?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Peter and Kristin are to read 20 fantasy novels each in a week. Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin. If Peter reads one book in 18 hours, how long will Kristin read half of her books?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Peter to read one book. We know that he can read one book in 18 hours, so we can write: Peter's reading speed = 1 book / 18 hours Next, we need to find out how long it takes Kristin to read one book. We know that Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin, so we can write: Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * Peter's reading speed Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * (1 book / 18 hours) Kristin's reading speed = 1 book / 54 hours Now we can use Kristin's reading speed to find out how long it takes her to read half of her books. We know that she needs to read 20 books in a week, so she needs to read 10 books in half a week (3.5 days). We can write: Time to read 10 books = 10 books * (1 book / 54 hours) * (24 hours / 1 day) * (3.5 days) Time to read 10 books = 14 hours and 27 minutes Therefore, it will take Kristin 14 hours and 27 minutes to read half of her books. The answer is 27.\n\n\nQ: James writes a comic every other day for 4 years. If there was no leap year, how many comics has he written?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days there are in 4 years. Since there are 365 days in a year, we can multiply 365 by 4 to get: 365 x 4 = 1460 days Next, we need to figure out how many comics James writes in every other day. Since he writes a comic every other day, we can divide the total number of days by 2 to get: 1460 / 2 = 730 comics Therefore, James has written 730 comics in 4 years if there was no leap year. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Gina chooses what she and her sister will watch on Netflix three times as often as her sister does. If her sister watches a total of 24 shows on Netflix per week, and each show is 50 minutes long, how many minutes of Netflix does Gina get to choose?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how often Gina chooses what they watch compared to her sister. We know that Gina chooses three times as often as her sister, so if her sister watches 24 shows per week, Gina chooses what they watch 3 times that amount, or 3 x 24 = 72 times per week. Next, we need to figure out how many minutes of Netflix each person gets to choose. We know that each show is 50 minutes long, so if Gina chooses 72 shows per week, she gets to choose 72 x 50 = 3600 minutes of Netflix per week. Therefore, Gina gets to choose 3600 minutes of Netflix per week. The answer is 3600.\n\n\nQ: Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour. Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour.  Oliver can read 40 pages.  How many pages can Carter read in 1 hour?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Oliver can read 40 pages in 1 hour. Next, we know that Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour, so Lucy can read 40 + 20 = 60 pages in 1 hour. Finally, we know that Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour, so Carter can read 60 / 2 = 30 pages in 1 hour. Therefore, Carter can read 30 pages in 1 hour. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: John takes a pill every 6 hours.  How many pills does he take a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 24 hours in a day, so John takes 24/6 = 4 pills per day. In a week, there are 7 days, so John takes 4 x 7 = 28 pills per week. The answer is 28.\n\n\nQ: Jill spends time every day talking to her boyfriend on the phone.  The first day of the week she spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend.  Each of the following days she spends twice as much time talking on the phone as the day before. After the 5th day her parents take the phone away from her because she was on it too long.  How much time did Jill spend talking to her boyfriend that week?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Jill spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend. On the second day, she spends twice as much time as the first day, which is 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 minutes. On the third day, she spends twice as much time as the second day, which is 2*10=<<2*10=20>>20 minutes. On the fourth day, she spends twice as much time as the third day, which is 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 minutes. On the fifth day, she spends twice as much time as the fourth day, which is 2*40=<<2*40=80>>80 minutes. Therefore, Jill spends a total of 5+10+20+40+80=<<5+10+20+40+80=155>>155 minutes talking to her boyfriend that week. The answer is 155.\n\n\nQ: John can play 200 beats per minute.  If he plays 2 hours a day for 3 days how many beats does he play?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many minutes John plays in total. Since he plays for 2 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, he plays for 2 x 60 = 120 minutes per day. Therefore, over 3 days, he plays for a total of 120 x 3 = 360 minutes. Now we need to find out how many beats he plays in total. If he plays 200 beats per minute, then in 360 minutes he plays 200 x 360 = 72,000 beats. So John plays 72,000 beats over the course of 3 days. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Ron is part of a book club that allows each member to take a turn picking a new book every week. The club is made up of three couples and five single people along with Ron and his wife. How many times a year does Ron get to pick a new book?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of people in the book club. There are three couples, which means six people. There are also five single people. Adding Ron and his wife, we get: 6 (couples) + 5 (singles) + 2 (Ron and his wife) = 13 people in the book club Since each member gets to pick a new book every week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, we can calculate the number of times Ron gets to pick a new book: Ron gets to pick a new book once every 13 weeks (since there are 13 people in the club) 52 weeks in a year \u00f7 13 weeks per pick = 4 times a year Therefore, Ron gets to pick a new book 4 times a year. The answer is 4.\n\n\n"
