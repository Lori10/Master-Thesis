  "test_question": "Q: Alex is getting ready to attend an event that she has hosted and wants to make sure that she has enough seats for everyone. She invites 100 people via email and each invited person says that they will also invite 2 of their friends. She then calls 10 of her friends to invite them too and 8 of them say they will be bringing their spouses. How many seats will Alex need?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Alex was having a cookout Friday night and planned to serve burgers to his guests.  He planned to cook 3 burgers for each guest and had invited 10 friends over.  1 of his friends didn't eat meat and said they would bring their own food.  Another one of his friends didn't eat bread and would not need the buns.  The burger buns came 8 to a pack.  How many packs of buns did Alex need to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many guests will be eating burgers. Alex invited 10 friends, but one won't be eating meat, so there will be 9 guests eating burgers. Next, we need to figure out how many burgers Alex will need to cook. He plans to cook 3 burgers for each guest, so he will need to cook 3 x 9 = 27 burgers. Now we need to figure out how many buns Alex will need. Each burger needs 2 buns, but one of his friends won't be eating the buns, so he will only need 2 x 26 = 52 buns. Since the buns come 8 to a pack, we need to divide 52 by 8 to find out how many packs of buns Alex needs to buy. 52 \u00f7 8 = 6.5 Since we can't buy half a pack of buns, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So Alex needs to buy 7 packs of buns. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many students are in Alice's class. We know that there are 40 students and 10 instructors, so the total number of people in the class is 40 + 10 = 50. Next, we need to figure out how many students are bringing their own life vests. We know that 20% of the students are bringing life vests, so we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of students by 0.2: 40 x 0.2 = 8. So 8 students are bringing their own life vests. Now we need to figure out how many life vests we still need. We have 20 life vests on hand, and we need one for each of the 50 people in the class. So we need 50 - 20 = 30 more life vests. However, we already know that 8 students are bringing their own life vests, so we can subtract those from the total number we need: 30 - 8 = 22. Therefore, Alice needs to get 22 more life vests so that the entire class has one. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Alyssa took 100 photos on vacation. She wants to put them in a photo album with 30 pages. She can place 3 photos each on the first 10 pages. Then she can place 4 photos each on the next 10 pages. If she wants to put an equal number of photos on each of the remaining pages of the album, how many photos can she place on each page?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Alyssa can place 3 photos each on the first 10 pages, which means she has used 3 x 10 = 30 photos. Then, she can place 4 photos each on the next 10 pages, which means she has used 4 x 10 = 40 photos. So far, she has used 30 + 40 = 70 photos. She has 100 - 70 = 30 photos left to place in the remaining pages. Since she wants to put an equal number of photos on each of the remaining pages, she can divide the remaining photos by the number of remaining pages: 30 \u00f7 10 = 3. Therefore, Alyssa can place 3 photos on each of the remaining 10 pages. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Ryan works in an office that has an even number of men and women working there.  Ryan participates in a meeting composed of 4 men and 6 women who are pulled from the office floor.   This reduces the number of women working on the office floor by 20%.  How many people work at Ryan's office?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the number of men and women in the office is even. Let's call this number \"x\". Next, we know that 4 men and 6 women were pulled from the office floor for the meeting. This means that there are now x-4 men and x-6 women still working on the office floor. We also know that the number of women on the office floor decreased by 20%. This means that the new number of women on the office floor is 0.8(x-6). Since we know that the number of men and women in the office is even, we can set up an equation: x-4 + 0.8(x-6) = x Simplifying this equation: 0.8x - 1.2 = 0 0.8x = 1.2 x = 1.2/0.8 x = 1.5 Since we know that x is an even number, the closest even number to 1.5 is 2. Therefore, there are 2 men and 2 women working at Ryan's office. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Nine hundred tickets were sold to a concert. Three-fourths of those who bought the ticket came before the start of the concert. Five-ninths of the remaining came few minutes after the first song. Eighty people arrived during the middle part of the concert while the rest did not go. How many of those who bought the tickets did not go?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many people came before the start of the concert. Three-fourths of 900 tickets = (3/4) x 900 = 675 people came before the start of the concert. Step 2: Find out how many people were left after the first group came. 900 - 675 = 225 people were left. Step 3: Find out how many people came few minutes after the first song. Five-ninths of the remaining 225 people = (5/9) x 225 = 125 people came few minutes after the first song. Step 4: Find out how many people were left after the second group came. 225 - 125 = 100 people were left. Step 5: Subtract the number of people who arrived during the middle part of the concert from the number of people left. 100 - 80 = 20 people did not go to the concert. Therefore, 20 people who bought the tickets did not go to the concert. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Dylan's mother is throwing a baby shower for her best friend. She is expecting 40 guests, of whom she has cleared the parking lot to park in to, leaving only her car and her husband's jeep in the parking lot. The 40 guests, though, arrive in only 10 cars that they park in the parking lot.  If each car has 4 wheels, how many car wheels are there in the parking lot, including both of Dylan's parent's car wheels?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many wheels the 10 cars have in total. Since each car has 4 wheels, we can multiply 10 by 4 to get: 10 x 4 = 40 So, the 10 cars have a total of 40 wheels. Next, we need to add the wheels of Dylan's parent's cars. Since we know they have one car and one jeep, we can calculate the total number of wheels by adding the number of wheels for each vehicle. A car has 4 wheels and a jeep has 4 wheels, so we can add: 4 + 4 = 8 Therefore, there are a total of 40 + 8 = 48 wheels in the parking lot, including both of Dylan's parent's car wheels. The answer is 48.\n\n\nQ: Dani brings two and half dozen cupcakes for her 2nd-grade class.  There are 27 students (including Dani), 1 teacher, and 1 teacher\u2019s aid.  If 3 students called in sick that day, how many cupcakes are left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Dani brought in total. Two and a half dozen cupcakes is equal to 30 cupcakes (since a dozen is 12). Next, we need to figure out how many people will be receiving cupcakes. There are 27 students, 1 teacher, and 1 teacher's aid, for a total of 29 people. However, 3 students called in sick, so we need to subtract them from the total. 29 - 3 = 26 people receiving cupcakes. Now, we need to subtract 26 cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes Dani brought. 30 - 26 = 4 cupcakes left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: An airline company owns 5 airplanes. Every airplane they own has 20 rows with 7 seats in each row. Each airplane makes 2 flights a day. How many passengers can the airline company accommodate each day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many seats are in one airplane. We can do this by multiplying the number of rows by the number of seats in each row: 20 rows x 7 seats per row = 140 seats per airplane Next, we need to find out how many passengers can fly on one airplane in a day. Since each airplane makes 2 flights a day, we can multiply the number of seats per airplane by 2: 140 seats per airplane x 2 flights per day = 280 passengers per airplane per day Finally, we need to find out how many passengers the airline company can accommodate in a day with all 5 airplanes: 280 passengers per airplane per day x 5 airplanes = 1,400 passengers per day Therefore, the airline company can accommodate 1,400 passengers each day. The answer is 1400.\n\n\n"
