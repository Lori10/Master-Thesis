  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A performing magician has a disappearing act where he makes a random member of his audience disappear and reappear. Unfortunately, one-tenth of the time, the audience member never reappears. However, one-fifth of the time, two people reappear instead of only one. If the magician has put on 100 performances of the act this year, how many people have reappeared?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people disappear in total. Since the magician chooses a random member of the audience each time, we can assume that one person disappears per performance. Therefore, 100 people have disappeared in total. Next, we need to find out how many times one person reappears. We know that one-tenth of the time, the person never reappears, so that means nine-tenths of the time, they do reappear. Therefore, 90 people have reappeared once. Finally, we need to find out how many times two people reappear. We know that one-fifth of the time, this happens. Since there were 100 performances in total, this means that 20 times, two people reappeared. Therefore, 40 people have reappeared twice. To find the total number of people who have reappeared, we add the number of people who have reappeared once to the number of people who have reappeared twice: 90 + 40 = 130 Therefore, 130 people have reappeared in total. The answer is 130.\n\n\nQ: John is working as an IT specialist. He repairs broken computers. One day he had to fix 20 computers. 20% of them were unfixable, and 40% of them needed to wait a few days for spare parts to come. The rest John was able to fix right away. How many computers John was able to fix right away?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many computers were unfixable. We know that 20% of 20 computers were unfixable, so we can calculate: 20% of 20 = 0.2 x 20 = 4 So, John couldn't fix 4 computers. Next, we need to find out how many computers needed to wait for spare parts. We know that 40% of 20 computers needed to wait, so we can calculate: 40% of 20 = 0.4 x 20 = 8 So, 8 computers needed to wait for spare parts. Now, we can subtract the unfixable and waiting computers from the total to find out how many John was able to fix right away: 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 Therefore, John was able to fix 8 computers right away. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Nine hundred tickets were sold to a concert. Three-fourths of those who bought the ticket came before the start of the concert. Five-ninths of the remaining came few minutes after the first song. Eighty people arrived during the middle part of the concert while the rest did not go. How many of those who bought the tickets did not go?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many people came before the start of the concert. Three-fourths of 900 tickets = (3/4) x 900 = 675 people came before the start of the concert. Step 2: Find out how many people were left after the first group came. 900 - 675 = 225 people were left. Step 3: Find out how many people came few minutes after the first song. Five-ninths of the remaining 225 people = (5/9) x 225 = 125 people came few minutes after the first song. Step 4: Find out how many people were left after the second group came. 225 - 125 = 100 people were left. Step 5: Subtract the number of people who arrived during the middle part of the concert from the number of people left. 100 - 80 = 20 people did not go to the concert. Therefore, 20 people who bought the tickets did not go to the concert. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: There are 50 marbles in a box which has a mixture of white, red and blue marbles. There were originally 20 white marbles and an equal number of red and blue marbles. Jack removes a number of marbles equal to double the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles. How many marbles are left in the box?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 20 white marbles and an equal number of red and blue marbles. So, we can say that there are 20 white, 15 red, and 15 blue marbles in the box. Next, we need to find the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles. In this case, the difference is 20 - 15 = 5. Then, we need to double that difference, which gives us 5 x 2 = 10. Jack removes 10 marbles from the box. So, the number of marbles left in the box is 50 - 10 = 40 marbles. The answer is 40.\n\n\nQ: Adam has just bought some new books so he has decided to clean up his bookcase. After he adds his new books to his bookshelf he realizes that he has bought enough books to finish completely filling his bookcase with 2 books left over. Before his shopping trip, Adam had 56 books in his bookcase. If his bookcase has 4 shelves and averages 20 books per shelf, how many books did Adam buy on his shopping trip?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many books can fit on Adam's bookcase. We know that he has 4 shelves and each shelf can hold an average of 20 books, so the total capacity of his bookcase is: 4 shelves x 20 books per shelf = 80 books Next, we need to figure out how many books Adam had before his shopping trip. We know that he had 56 books in his bookcase before he bought any new books. Now, we can use the information given in the problem to figure out how many books Adam bought on his shopping trip. We know that he bought enough books to completely fill his bookcase with 2 books left over. This means that he bought: 80 books - 2 books left over = 78 books Therefore, Adam bought 78 books on his shopping trip. The answer is 78.\n\n\nQ: Jerry is sweeping up pieces of broken glass in the parking lot. He sweeps up 20 amber pieces, 35 green pieces, and some clear pieces. If the green pieces are 25% of the total glass he sweeps up, how many pieces were clear?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the green pieces are 25% of the total glass, so we can set up an equation: 35 = 0.25x where x is the total number of pieces of glass Jerry sweeps up. We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.25: x = 140 So Jerry sweeps up a total of 140 pieces of glass. We also know that he sweeps up 20 amber pieces and 35 green pieces, so the number of clear pieces must be: 140 - 20 - 35 = 85 Therefore, Jerry swept up 85 clear pieces of glass. The answer is 85.\n\n\nQ: Alyssa took 100 photos on vacation. She wants to put them in a photo album with 30 pages. She can place 3 photos each on the first 10 pages. Then she can place 4 photos each on the next 10 pages. If she wants to put an equal number of photos on each of the remaining pages of the album, how many photos can she place on each page?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Alyssa can place 3 photos each on the first 10 pages, which means she has used 3 x 10 = 30 photos. Then, she can place 4 photos each on the next 10 pages, which means she has used 4 x 10 = 40 photos. So far, she has used 30 + 40 = 70 photos. She has 100 - 70 = 30 photos left to place in the remaining pages. Since she wants to put an equal number of photos on each of the remaining pages, she can divide the remaining photos by the number of remaining pages: 30 \u00f7 10 = 3. Therefore, Alyssa can place 3 photos on each of the remaining 10 pages. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\n"
