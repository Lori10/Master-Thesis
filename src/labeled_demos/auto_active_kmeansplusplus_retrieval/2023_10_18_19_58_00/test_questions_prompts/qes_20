  "test_question": "Q: A bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers it flies by because it can sense they don't have any nectar in them. How many flowers will the bee fly by to bypass 8 flowers? Answer Choices: (A) 2000 (B) 4000 (C) 8000 (D) 16000 (E) 32000",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: How many 4-digit Q numbers (ABCD) can be formed such that |A \u2013 D| = 2? Answer Choices: (A) 2,000 (B) 1,900 (C) 1,800 (D) 1,600 (E) 1,500\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that |A \u2013 D| = 2. This means that A and D are either 2 digits apart or 2 digits away from each other in the number line. Case 1: A is 2 digits greater than D. In this case, we can choose any digit from 1 to 9 for D (since it's a 4-digit number, we can't have 0 as the first digit). Then, A can be any digit that is 2 greater than D, except for 9 (since we can't have a 5th digit). So, there are 8 choices for A. Case 2: D is 2 digits greater than A. This is the same as Case 1, but with A and D switched. So, there are also 8 choices for A in this case. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit Q numbers that can be formed is 8 + 8 = 16. The answer is (D) 1,600. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: An elevator starts with 5 pasengers and stops at 8 different floors of the house. Find out the probability of all the 5 passengers alighting at different floors. Answer Choices: (A) 90 / 512 (B) 105 / 512 (C) 15/512 (D) 30/512 (E) 48/512\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 8 floors and 5 passengers, so the first passenger has 8 choices of floors to get off at. The second passenger has 7 choices of floors left, the third passenger has 6 choices, the fourth passenger has 5 choices, and the last passenger has 4 choices. Therefore, the total number of ways that the passengers can get off at different floors is: 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 = 6,720 Now, we need to find the total number of ways that the passengers can get off at any floor. This is simply: 8^5 = 32,768 So, the probability of all the passengers getting off at different floors is: 6,720 / 32,768 = 105 / 512 Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 105 / 512. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A mailman puts .05% of letters in the wrong mailbox. How many deliveries must he make to misdeliver 2 items? Answer Choices: (A) 4000 (B) 400 (C) 40 (D) 40000 (E) 4500\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert .05% to a decimal, which is 0.0005. This represents the probability of a letter being misdelivered. Let's call the number of deliveries the mailman makes \"x\". We want to find the value of x that results in 2 misdelivered items. To set up the equation, we can use the formula for probability: probability = number of desired outcomes / total number of outcomes In this case, the desired outcome is 2 misdelivered items, and the total number of outcomes is the number of deliveries the mailman makes (x). So we can write: 0.0005x = 2 To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.0005: x = 2 / 0.0005 x = 4000 Therefore, the answer is (A) 4000. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Using all the letters of the word \"NOKIA\", how many words can be formed, which begin with N and end with A? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 24 (C) 62 (D) 78 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to choose the first letter as N, which leaves us with four letters: O, K, I, and A. Next, we need to arrange these four letters in different ways to form words. This can be done in 4! = 24 ways. Finally, we need to ensure that each word ends with A. Out of the four remaining letters, only one is A. Therefore, there is only one way to choose the last letter. So, the total number of words that can be formed is 24 x 1 = 24. Therefore, the answer is (B) 24. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
