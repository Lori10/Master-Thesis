  "test_question": "Q: A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In what ratio mental A at Rs.68 per kg be mixed with another metal at Rs.96 per kg so that cost of alloy (mixture) is Rs.72 per kg? Answer Choices: (A) 6:1 (B) 4:7 (C) 3:7 (D) 9:5 (E) 9:8\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the ratio of mental A to the other metal be x:y. Then, the cost of 1 kg of the alloy is given by: (68x + 96y)/(x+y) = 72 Multiplying both sides by (x+y), we get: 68x + 96y = 72(x+y) Expanding and simplifying, we get: 4x = 3y So, the ratio of mental A to the other metal is 4:3. However, this is not one of the answer choices. We can try simplifying the ratio further by dividing both sides by 3: 4/3 : 1 Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: 4 : 3 So, the ratio of mental A to the other metal is 4:3, which is equivalent to option (None of the above). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: What percent of 9.6 kg is 28 gms ? Answer Choices: (A) 25 (B) 66 (C) 288 (D) 29 (E) 17\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 9.6 kg to grams: 9.6 kg = 9.6 x 1000 g = 9600 g Now we can set up the proportion: 28 g / 9600 g = x / 100 Solving for x: x = (28 x 100) / 9600 x = 0.29 So the answer is approximately 29%. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 29. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: In a weight-lifting competition, the total weight of Joe's two lifts was 450 pounds. If twice the weight of his first lift was 300 pounds more than the weight of his second lift, what was the weight, in pounds, of his first lift? Answer Choices: (A) 250 (B) 275 (C) 325 (D) 350 (E) 400\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the weight of Joe's first lift as 'x' pounds. According to the problem, the total weight of Joe's two lifts was 450 pounds. So, the weight of his second lift can be represented as (450 - x) pounds. Now, the problem also states that twice the weight of his first lift was 300 pounds more than the weight of his second lift. Mathematically, we can represent this as: 2x = (450 - x) + 300 Simplifying this equation, we get: 3x = 750 x = 250 Therefore, the weight of Joe's first lift was 250 pounds. Hence, the answer is (A) 250. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A boat having a length 3 m and breadth 2 m is floating on a lake. The boat sinks by 1.2 cm when a man gets on it. The mass of man is Answer Choices: (A) 72 kg (B) 60 kg (C) 72 kg (D) 96 kg (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the volume of water displaced by the boat before the man gets on it. Volume of water displaced = length x breadth x height of displacement = 3m x 2m x 0.012m (1.2 cm converted to meters) = 0.072 cubic meters Now, when the man gets on the boat, the boat sinks by 1.2 cm more. So, the new height of displacement is 0.024m (0.012m + 0.012m). Let's assume the density of water is 1000 kg/m^3. The weight of water displaced by the boat before the man gets on it = volume of water displaced x density of water = 0.072m^3 x 1000 kg/m^3 = 72 kg The weight of water displaced by the boat after the man gets on it = (volume of water displaced + additional displacement due to the man) x density of water = (3m x 2m x 0.024m) x 1000 kg/m^3 = 1.44 kg Therefore, the weight of the man = weight of water displaced before the man gets on the boat - weight of water displaced after the man gets on the boat = 72 kg - 1.44 kg = 70.56 kg So, the answer is (E) None of the above. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
