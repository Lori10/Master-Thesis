  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The sum of the first 50 positive even integers is 2550. What is the sum of the even integers from 302 to 400 inclusive? Answer Choices: (A) 11,550 (B) 14,550 (C) 17,550 (D) 20,550 (E) 23,550\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the sum of the first 50 positive even integers. We know that the first even integer is 2, the second is 4, the third is 6, and so on. So, we can write the sum as: 2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 98 + 100 = 2550 Next, we need to find the sum of the even integers from 302 to 400 inclusive. We can start by finding the sum of all even integers from 2 to 400, and then subtracting the sum of all even integers from 2 to 300. This will give us the sum of even integers from 302 to 400. The sum of all even integers from 2 to 400 can be found using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = (n/2)(a + l) where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term. In this case, a = 2, l = 400, and n = (400 - 2)/2 + 1 = 200. So, we have: S1 = (200/2)(2 + 400) = 40200 Next, we need to find the sum of all even integers from 2 to 300. Using the same formula, we have: S2 = (150/2)(2 + 300) = 22650 Finally, we can find the sum of even integers from 302 to 400 by subtracting S2 from S1: S3 = S1 - S2 = 40200 - 22650 = 17550 Therefore, the answer is (C) 17,550. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Find the invalid no.from the following series 10, 17, 22, 29, 34, 36 Answer Choices: (A) 36 (B) 18 (C) 40 (D) 37 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. The given series is 10, 17, 22, 29, 34, 36. To find the invalid number, we need to identify the pattern in the series. The pattern is that each number is obtained by adding 5 or 7 to the previous number. 10 + 7 = 17 17 + 5 = 22 22 + 7 = 29 29 + 5 = 34 34 + 2 = 36 The invalid number is 36 because it is not obtained by adding 5 or 7 to the previous number. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 36. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: you need to pict any number from 1, 3,5,7,9,11,13 and 15 to make below equation true.\n()+()+()=30\ncan you solve it? Answer Choices: (A) 7+15+9 (B) 6+15+9 (C) 6+14+9 (D) 6+15+8 (E) 8+15+9\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find three odd numbers that add up to 30. The sum of three odd numbers is always an odd number. Therefore, we can eliminate options (B) and (D) since they have an even number in them. Next, we can eliminate option (C) since the sum of 6, 14, and 9 is 29, not 30. Now, we are left with options (A) and (E). We can check both options to see which one adds up to 30. Option (A): 7 + 15 + 9 = 31, not 30. Option (E): 8 + 15 + 9 = 32, not 30. Therefore, none of the given options are correct. The answer is \"None of the above\". The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: If \"COMPUTER\" was given a code of 111, then what is the sum of \"VIRUS\" and \"WORM\"? Answer Choices: (A) 123 (B) 22 (C) 20 (D) 160 (E) 158\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine the code for \"VIRUS\" and \"WORM\". We are not given any information about the code for individual letters, so we cannot determine this directly. However, we do know that \"COMPUTER\" has a code of 111. We can use this information to try and find a relationship between the letters in \"COMPUTER\" and the letters in \"VIRUS\" and \"WORM\". One possible relationship is that the code for each letter in \"VIRUS\" and \"WORM\" is equal to the code for the corresponding letter in \"COMPUTER\" plus a certain constant. Let's call this constant \"k\". Using this relationship, we can set up two equations: V + k + I + k + R + k + U + k + S + k = ? W + k + O + k + R + k + M + k = ? We don't know the values of \"k\" or the sum of the codes, but we can simplify the equations by combining like terms: (5k + V + I + R + U + S) = ? (4k + W + O + R + M) = ? We still don't have enough information to solve for the sum of the codes, but we can use the fact that the sum of the codes is a multiple of 3 (since 111 is a multiple of 3). Looking at the simplified equations, we can see that the sum of the letters in \"VIRUS\" is 5 + V + I + R + U + S, which is odd (since 5 is odd). Therefore, the sum of the letters in \"WORM\" must be even in order for the sum of the codes to be a multiple of 3. The only answer choice that is even is (C) 20. Therefore, the answer is (C) 20. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
