  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In order to obtain an income of Rs. 650 from 10% stock at Rs. 96, one must make an investment of Answer Choices: (A) 5363 (B) 6240 (C) 2368 (D) 1987 (E) 2732\nA: Let's think step by step. The annual income from the stock is 10% of the investment. So, we can set up the equation: 10% of the investment = Rs. 650 0.1 x investment = 650 investment = 650 / 0.1 investment = Rs. 6,500 Now, we need to find out how many shares can be bought with an investment of Rs. 6,500 at Rs. 96 per share. Number of shares = investment / share price Number of shares = 6,500 / 96 Number of shares = 67.71 (approx.) Since we cannot buy a fraction of a share, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Number of shares = 68 Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 2732, which is the total investment required to buy 68 shares at Rs. 96 per share. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Rahim bought 65 books for Rs.1150 from one shop and 50 books for Rs.920 from another. What is the average price he paid per book ? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 18 (C) 99 (D) 787 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total cost of all the books Rahim bought. Total cost = Rs.1150 + Rs.920 = Rs.2070 Next, we need to find the total number of books Rahim bought. Total number of books = 65 + 50 = 115 Finally, we can find the average price per book by dividing the total cost by the total number of books. Average price per book = Total cost / Total number of books Average price per book = Rs.2070 / 115 Average price per book = Rs.18 Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 18. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Mike invested Rs. 3750 in a scheme for 3 years at compound interest rate 6.5% p.a. How much amount will Mike get on maturity of the fixed deposit? Answer Choices: (A) s.4581.29 (B) s.4450 (C) s.4500 (D) s.4500.25 (E) s.4529.81\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the formula for compound interest to solve this problem: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) Where: A = the amount at the end of the investment P = the principal amount (initial investment) r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal) n = the number of times the interest is compounded per year t = the time period of the investment (in years) Plugging in the given values, we get: A = 3750(1 + 0.065/1)^(1*3) A = 3750(1.065)^3 A = 3750(1.207) A = 4522.50 Therefore, the closest answer choice is (E) s.4529.81. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Gautami went to the stationers and bought things worth Rs. 100, out of which 50 paise went on sales tax on taxable purchases. If the tax rate was 5%. then what was the cost of the tax free items? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 99.50 (B) Rs. 70.50 (C) Rs. 89.50 (D) Rs. 69.50 (E) Rs. 80.50\nA: Let's think step by step. The total cost of the items including tax is Rs. 100. Out of this, 50 paise (or Rs. 0.50) went on sales tax. We know that the tax rate is 5%. So, we can set up an equation: 5% of the taxable purchases = Rs. 0.50 To find the cost of tax-free items, we need to subtract the tax amount from the total cost: Cost of tax-free items = Total cost - Tax amount Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 100 - Rs. 0.50 Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 99.50 Therefore, the answer is (A) Rs. 99.50. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
