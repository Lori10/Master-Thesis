  "test_question": "Q: At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day? Answer Choices: (A) 4,000 (B) 4,200 (C) 4,500 (D) 4,800 (E) 5,000",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A mailman puts .05% of letters in the wrong mailbox. How many deliveries must he make to misdeliver 2 items? Answer Choices: (A) 4000 (B) 400 (C) 40 (D) 40000 (E) 4500\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert .05% to a decimal, which is 0.0005. This represents the probability of a letter being misdelivered. Let's call the number of deliveries the mailman makes \"x\". We want to find the value of x that results in 2 misdelivered items. To set up the equation, we can use the formula for probability: probability = number of desired outcomes / total number of outcomes In this case, the desired outcome is 2 misdelivered items, and the total number of outcomes is the number of deliveries the mailman makes (x). So we can write: 0.0005x = 2 To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.0005: x = 2 / 0.0005 x = 4000 Therefore, the answer is (A) 4000. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 25 copies per minute. A second copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 55 copies per minute. Working together at their respective rates, how many copies do the two machines make in half an hour ? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 2,400 (C) 4,500 (D) 5,400 (E) 324,000\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the combined rate of the two machines. To do this, we add their individual rates: 25 copies/minute + 55 copies/minute = 80 copies/minute Next, we need to convert half an hour to minutes: 30 minutes Now we can use the formula: rate x time = amount Plugging in the values we have: 80 copies/minute x 30 minutes = 2400 copies Therefore, the answer is (B) 2,400. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A work which could be finished in 10 days was finished 3 days earlier after 10 more men joined. The number of men employed was? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 20 (C) 88 (D) 71 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the number of men initially employed be x. Then, the work done in 1 day by x men is 1/10 and the work done in 1 day by (x+10) men is 1/(10-3) = 1/7 (since the work was finished 3 days earlier). Now, we can set up an equation based on the work done by x men and (x+10) men: x/10 + (x+10)/7 = 1 Multiplying both sides by 70 (the least common multiple of 10 and 7) gives: 7x + 10(x+10) = 70 Simplifying and solving for x gives: 17x = 60 x = 60/17 Since x is not a whole number, none of the answer choices are correct. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: A box contains five bulbs out of which 3 are defective. If four bulbs are chosen at random, find the probability that atleast one bulb is good. Answer Choices: (A) 39/10 (B) 29/10 (C) 19/10 (D) 9/10 (E) 125/128\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. Total number of ways to choose 4 bulbs out of 5 = 5C4 = 5 Number of ways to choose 4 defective bulbs out of 3 = 3C4 = 0 Therefore, number of ways to choose atleast one good bulb = Total number of ways - Number of ways to choose 4 defective bulbs = 5 - 0 = 5 Now, let's calculate the probability of choosing atleast one good bulb. Probability of choosing atleast one good bulb = Number of ways to choose atleast one good bulb / Total number of ways to choose 4 bulbs Probability of choosing atleast one good bulb = 5 / 5C4 = 5/5 = 1 Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 9/10. However, none of the answer choices match the correct answer. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
