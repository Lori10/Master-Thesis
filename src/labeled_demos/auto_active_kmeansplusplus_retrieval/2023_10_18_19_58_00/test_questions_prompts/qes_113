  "test_question": "Q: There are ten lime soda bottles on a table in a restaurant. They are to be served among two different groups of customers consisting of 5 members each. How many ways are there to create these 2 groups? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 105 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) 525",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: We have 4 people and 1 chairs. In how many ways chairs can be occupy? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 86 (C) 24 (D) 14 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. If we have 4 people and only 1 chair, then only one person can sit on the chair at a time. So, we need to find the number of ways in which we can choose one person out of 4 to sit on the chair. The number of ways to choose one person out of 4 is 4. Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. None of the other options are correct as they are either too high or too low for the given scenario. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In how many different orders can the people Alice, Benjamin, Charlene, David, Elaine, Frederick, Gale, and Harold be standing on line if each of Alice, Benjamin, Charlene must be on the line before each of Frederick, Gale, and Harold? Answer Choices: (A) 1,008 (B) 1,296 (C) 1,512 (D) 2,016 (E) 2,268\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to arrange Alice, Benjamin, and Charlene in a line. This can be done in 3! = 6 ways. Next, we need to arrange Frederick, Gale, and Harold in a line. This can also be done in 3! = 6 ways. Now, we have 5 people left to arrange: David, Elaine, and the 3 groups of 3 people (ABC, FGH). We can think of these 5 people as 5 slots that need to be filled. The first slot can be filled by any of the 8 people. The second slot can be filled by any of the remaining 7 people. The third slot can be filled by any of the remaining 6 people. The fourth slot can be filled by any of the remaining 5 people. The fifth slot can be filled by any of the remaining 4 people. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange all 8 people is: 6 x 6 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 = 1,296 So the answer is (B) 1,296. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A drink vendor has 60 liters of Maaza, 144 liters of Pepsi and 368 liters of Sprite. He wants to pack them in cans, so that each can contains the same number of liters of a drink, and doesn't want to mix any two drinks in a can. What is the least number of cans required? Answer Choices: (A) 135 (B) 137 (C) 143 (D) 310 (E) 380\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 60, 144, and 368 to determine the maximum number of liters that can be packed in a can. The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. The prime factorization of 144 is 2^4 * 3^2. The prime factorization of 368 is 2^4 * 23. The GCD of these three numbers is 12 (2^2 * 3). Therefore, each can can contain a maximum of 12 liters of a drink. To find the least number of cans required, we need to divide each quantity by 12 and round up to the nearest integer. 60/12 = 5 144/12 = 12 368/12 = 31 So we need at least 5 cans of Maaza, 12 cans of Pepsi, and 31 cans of Sprite. The total number of cans required is 5 + 12 + 31 = 48. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Four different books (A, B, C and D) are to be arranged on a shelf. Books A and B are to be arranged first and second starting from the right of the shelf. The number of different orders in which books C and D may be arranged is Answer Choices: (A) 16! (B) 12! (C) 8! (D) 11! (E) 2!\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we arrange books A and B in 2! = 2 ways. Then, we have two remaining books, C and D, which can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways. Therefore, the total number of different orders in which the four books can be arranged is 2 x 2 = 4. None of the above answer choices match this result, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
