They decide that a coin will be flipped twenty times and each time it turns heads, Christopher will give $2 to Jonathan and each time it turns out to be Tails, Jonathan will give 3$ to Christopher. After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount.\nHow many times did the coin landed on Heads ? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 23 (C) 16 (D) 18 (E) 12",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In a game, a person is declared winner, if he gets 4 consecutive tails in five throws of a coin. What is the probability of A to win if he has got a tail in the first throw? Answer Choices: (A) 1/5 (B) 1/4 (C) 1/8 (D) 1/16 (E) 1/6\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that A has already gotten a tail in the first throw. Now, in order to win, A needs to get 3 more consecutive tails in the next 4 throws. The probability of getting a tail in any given throw is 1/2 (assuming a fair coin). So, the probability of getting 4 consecutive tails in 5 throws can be calculated as follows: Probability = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/32 However, we need to take into account that A has already gotten a tail in the first throw. So, we only need to consider the probability of getting 3 consecutive tails in the next 4 throws. Probability = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16 Therefore, the probability of A winning if he has already gotten a tail in the first throw is 1/16. The correct answer is (D) 1/16. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Peter rolls two dice at the same time. What is the probability that the total sum of numbers on the dices is 3? Answer Choices: (A) a)  1/12 (B) b)  1/36 (C) c)  1/6 (D) d)  1/18 (E) e)  1/3\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice, as each die has 6 possible outcomes. To get a sum of 3, the only possible outcomes are (1,2) and (2,1). Therefore, there are only 2 favorable outcomes out of 36 possible outcomes. So, the probability of getting a sum of 3 is 2/36, which simplifies to 1/18. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) d) 1/18. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Bill\u2019s compact disc player randomly plays a song, so that no song is repeated before the entire album is played. If Bill plays a disc with 12 songs, what are the chances that the third song he hears will be his favorite? Answer Choices: (A) 1/12 (B) 1/13 (C) 1/11 (D) 3/14 (E) 1/3\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 12 songs on the disc, so the probability of any one song being played third is 1/12. However, we are looking for the probability that Bill's favorite song is played third. Since the songs are played randomly, there are 12 possible songs that could be played first, 11 possible songs that could be played second (since one song has already been played), and 10 possible songs that could be played third (since two songs have already been played). Therefore, the probability of Bill's favorite song being played third is: 1/12 (probability of it being the third song) x 1/11 (probability of it being one of the remaining songs on the second play) x 1/10 (probability of it being one of the remaining songs on the third play) = 1/132 So the answer is (B) 1/13. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: We have 4 people and 1 chairs. In how many ways chairs can be occupy? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 86 (C) 24 (D) 14 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. If we have 4 people and only 1 chair, then only one person can sit on the chair at a time. So, we need to find the number of ways in which we can choose one person out of 4 to sit on the chair. The number of ways to choose one person out of 4 is 4. Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. None of the other options are correct as they are either too high or too low for the given scenario. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
