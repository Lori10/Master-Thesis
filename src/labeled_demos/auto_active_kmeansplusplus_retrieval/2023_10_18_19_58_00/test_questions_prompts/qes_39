  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Rahim bought 65 books for Rs.1150 from one shop and 50 books for Rs.920 from another. What is the average price he paid per book ? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 18 (C) 99 (D) 787 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total cost of all the books Rahim bought. Total cost = Rs.1150 + Rs.920 = Rs.2070 Next, we need to find the total number of books Rahim bought. Total number of books = 65 + 50 = 115 Finally, we can find the average price per book by dividing the total cost by the total number of books. Average price per book = Total cost / Total number of books Average price per book = Rs.2070 / 115 Average price per book = Rs.18 Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 18. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Gautami went to the stationers and bought things worth Rs. 100, out of which 50 paise went on sales tax on taxable purchases. If the tax rate was 5%. then what was the cost of the tax free items? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 99.50 (B) Rs. 70.50 (C) Rs. 89.50 (D) Rs. 69.50 (E) Rs. 80.50\nA: Let's think step by step. The total cost of the items including tax is Rs. 100. Out of this, 50 paise (or Rs. 0.50) went on sales tax. We know that the tax rate is 5%. So, we can set up an equation: 5% of the taxable purchases = Rs. 0.50 To find the cost of tax-free items, we need to subtract the tax amount from the total cost: Cost of tax-free items = Total cost - Tax amount Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 100 - Rs. 0.50 Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 99.50 Therefore, the answer is (A) Rs. 99.50. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The price of commodity X increases by 40 paise every year, while the price of commodityY increases by 15 paise every year. If in 2001, the price of commodity X was Rs. 4.20 and that of Y was Rs. 6.30, in which year commodity X will cost 40 paise more than the commodity Y ? Answer Choices: (A) 2010 (B) 2011 (C) 2012 (D) 2013 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the number of years after 2001 is 'n'. The price of commodity X after 'n' years = Rs. 4.20 + 0.40n The price of commodity Y after 'n' years = Rs. 6.30 + 0.15n We need to find the year when commodity X will cost 40 paise more than commodity Y. So, we can set up the equation: 4.20 + 0.40n = 6.30 + 0.15n + 0.40 Simplifying the equation, we get: 0.25n = 0.50 n = 2 Therefore, commodity X will cost 40 paise more than commodity Y after 2 years from 2001, which is in the year 2003. Hence, the correct answer is (E) None. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Arun purchased 30 kg of wheat at the rate of Rs. 11.50 per kg and 20 kg of wheat at the rate of 14.25 per kg. He mixed the two and sold the mixture. Approximately what price per kg should be sell the mixture to make 35% profit? Answer Choices: (A) 16.39 (B) 16.33 (C) 16.35 (D) 17.01 (E) 16.32\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost price of the wheat that Arun purchased: Cost price of 30 kg of wheat = 30 x 11.50 = Rs. 345 Cost price of 20 kg of wheat = 20 x 14.25 = Rs. 285 Total cost price = 345 + 285 = Rs. 630 Now, Arun wants to make a 35% profit on this cost price. So, the selling price of the mixture should be: Selling price = Cost price + Profit Profit = 35% of Cost price = 0.35 x 630 = Rs. 220.50 Selling price = 630 + 220.50 = Rs. 850.50 Finally, we need to find the price per kg of the mixture. Arun has a total of 50 kg of wheat (30 kg + 20 kg), so: Price per kg = Selling price / Total quantity Price per kg = 850.50 / 50 = Rs. 17.01 Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 17.01. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
