  "test_question": "Q: At a conference, one team is made up of 4 men and 4 women. Four presenters are chosen to present the team's findings in front of the entire conference. How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only? (Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.) Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: We have 4 people and 1 chairs. In how many ways chairs can be occupy? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 86 (C) 24 (D) 14 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. If we have 4 people and only 1 chair, then only one person can sit on the chair at a time. So, we need to find the number of ways in which we can choose one person out of 4 to sit on the chair. The number of ways to choose one person out of 4 is 4. Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. None of the other options are correct as they are either too high or too low for the given scenario. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: From a group of 14 astronauts that includes 5 people with previous experience in space flight, a 3-person crew is to be selected so that exactly 1 person in the crew has previous experience in space flight. How many different crews of this type are possible? Answer Choices: (A) 175 (B) 190 (C) 165 (D) 180 (E) 200\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We need to choose 1 person with previous experience in space flight from the 5 available options. This can be done in 5 ways. Step 2: We need to choose 2 people without previous experience in space flight from the remaining 9 options. This can be done in 9 choose 2 ways, which is equal to (9!)/(2!7!) = 36 ways. Step 3: The total number of possible crews of this type is the product of the number of ways to perform each step. Therefore, the answer is 5 x 36 = 180. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 180. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: In how many different orders can the people Alice, Benjamin, Charlene, David, Elaine, Frederick, Gale, and Harold be standing on line if each of Alice, Benjamin, Charlene must be on the line before each of Frederick, Gale, and Harold? Answer Choices: (A) 1,008 (B) 1,296 (C) 1,512 (D) 2,016 (E) 2,268\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to arrange Alice, Benjamin, and Charlene in a line. This can be done in 3! = 6 ways. Next, we need to arrange Frederick, Gale, and Harold in a line. This can also be done in 3! = 6 ways. Now, we have 5 people left to arrange: David, Elaine, and the 3 groups of 3 people (ABC, FGH). We can think of these 5 people as 5 slots that need to be filled. The first slot can be filled by any of the 8 people. The second slot can be filled by any of the remaining 7 people. The third slot can be filled by any of the remaining 6 people. The fourth slot can be filled by any of the remaining 5 people. The fifth slot can be filled by any of the remaining 4 people. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange all 8 people is: 6 x 6 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 = 1,296 So the answer is (B) 1,296. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A firm has 3 senior partners and 6 junior partners. How many different groups of 3 partners can be formed in which at least one member of the group is a senior partner? (Note that two groups are considered different if at least one group member is different.) Answer Choices: (A) 64 (B) 68 (C) 72 (D) 76 (E) 80\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of ways to form a group of 3 partners from 9 partners (3 senior + 6 junior). This can be done using the combination formula: C(9,3) = 84 Step 2: Find the number of ways to form a group of 3 partners in which all members are junior partners. This can be done using the combination formula: C(6,3) = 20 Step 3: Find the number of ways to form a group of 3 partners in which no senior partner is included. This can be done by selecting 3 junior partners from the 6 available: C(6,3) = 20 Step 4: Subtract the number of groups in Step 2 and Step 3 from the total number of groups in Step 1 to get the number of groups in which at least one senior partner is included: 84 - 20 - 20 = 44 Therefore, the answer is (None of the above). The answer is C.\n\n\n"
