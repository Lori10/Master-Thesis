  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If the selling price is quadrupled,the profit is pentadruple, what is the percentage of profit?? Answer Choices: (A) 50% (B) 100% (C) 150% (D) 200% (E) 250%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the cost price of the item is $100. If the selling price is quadrupled, the new selling price would be $400. Let's say the profit made at the original selling price was $x. If the profit is pentadrupled, the new profit would be $5x. Profit = Selling price - Cost price So, x = Selling price - $100 $5x = $400 - $100 $5x = $300 x = $60 Therefore, the original profit was $60 and the new profit is $300. Percentage increase in profit = (New profit - Original profit) / Original profit * 100 = (300 - 60) / 60 * 100 = 400% So, the answer is (D) 200%. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A part-time employee whose hourly wage was decreased by 20 percent decided to increase the number of hours worked per week so that the employee's total income did not change. By what percent E should the number of hours worked be increased? Answer Choices: (A) 12.5% (B) 20% (C) 25% (D) 50% (E) 100%\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that the employee originally worked for x hours per week and earned y dollars per week. After the wage decrease of 20%, the employee's new hourly wage is 0.8y/x dollars per hour. To maintain the same total income, the employee needs to work for more hours. Let's call the new number of hours worked per week E. The employee's new weekly income is (0.8y/x) * E dollars. We want to find the percentage increase in the number of hours worked, which is given by: (E - x)/x * 100% Setting the new weekly income equal to the original weekly income, we get: (0.8y/x) * E = y Solving for E, we get: E = 1.25x Therefore, the percentage increase in the number of hours worked is: (E - x)/x * 100% = (1.25x - x)/x * 100% = 0.25 * 100% = 25% So the answer is (C) 25%. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: When sold at a 60% discount, a sweater nets the merchant a 20% profit on the wholesale cost at which he initially purchased the item. By what % is the sweater marked up from wholesale at its normal retail price? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 66.67% (D) 80% (E) 100%\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that the wholesale cost of the sweater is $100. If the merchant sells the sweater at a 60% discount, he sells it for 40% of the original price, which is $40. Now, we know that the merchant makes a 20% profit on the wholesale cost at which he initially purchased the item. So, the cost price for the merchant is $100, and he makes a profit of 20%, which is $20. Therefore, the selling price for the merchant is $120. We can now calculate the markup percentage from the wholesale price to the normal retail price. Markup percentage = (Selling price - Wholesale price) / Wholesale price x 100% Markup percentage = ($120 - $100) / $100 x 100% Markup percentage = 20% Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 20%. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: By selling 300 apples a seller gains the selling price of 60 apples. The gain percent of the seller is Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 88 (C) 25 (D) 27 (E) 19\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the selling price of one apple is $1. Therefore, the selling price of 300 apples is $300 and the selling price of 60 apples is $60. The seller gains the selling price of 60 apples, which is $60. Profit percent = (Profit/Cost Price) x 100 Here, the profit is $60 and the cost price is the selling price of 240 apples (300-60), which is $240. Profit percent = (60/240) x 100 = 25% Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 25. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
