  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If n is a prime number, which of the following could be true Answer Choices: (A) n^n/4 = 1^(n-1)  (B) n^2/4= is even (C) (n) (n^n)  = is negative (D) n^2+n^3= n^5 (E) n^n=n\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's analyze each option one by one. (A) n^n/4 = 1^(n-1) If n is a prime number, then n is greater than 1. Therefore, 1^(n-1) = 1. So, the equation becomes n^n/4 = 1, which implies that n^n = 4. This is not possible for any prime number n. Therefore, option (A) is not correct. (B) n^2/4= is even If n is a prime number, then n is odd (except for 2). Therefore, n^2 is odd and cannot be even. So, option (B) is not correct. (C) (n) (n^n) = is negative If n is a prime number, then n is positive. Therefore, n^n is also positive. The product of two positive numbers is always positive. So, option (C) is not correct. (D) n^2+n^3= n^5 We can simplify the left-hand side of the equation as n^2(1+n) = n^5. Dividing both sides by n^2, we get 1+n = n^3. This is not possible for any prime number n (except for n=2). Therefore, option (D) is not correct. (E) n^n=n If n is a prime number, then n is greater than 1. Therefore, n^n is greater than n. So, option (E) is not correct. None of the above options are correct. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Which of the following inequalities has a solution set, when graphed on the number line, is a single line segment of finite length? Answer Choices: (A) 2 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (B) 3 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (C) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (D) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (E) 4 <= 3x+4 <= 6\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to isolate the variable (x) in the inequality. We can do this by subtracting 4 from all parts of the inequality: (A) 2 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes -2 <= 3x <= 2 (B) 3 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes -1 <= 3x <= 2 (C) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes 1 <= 3x <= 2 (D) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes 1 <= 3x <= 2 (E) 4 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes 0 <= 3x <= 2 Now we can divide all parts of the inequality by 3: (A) -2/3 <= x <= 2/3 (B) -1/3 <= x <= 2/3 (C) 1/3 <= x <= 2/3 (D) 1/3 <= x <= 2/3 (E) 0 <= x <= 2/3 Option (C) has a solution set that is a single line segment of finite length, from x=1/3 to x=2/3. Therefore, the correct answer is (C). The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: How many integer values W are there for x such that 1 < 3x + 5 < 17? Answer Choices: (A) Two (B) Three (C) Four (D) Five (E) Six\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to isolate x in the inequality. 1 < 3x + 5 < 17 Subtract 5 from all parts of the inequality: -4 < 3x < 12 Divide all parts of the inequality by 3: -4/3 < x < 4 Now we know that x must be between -4/3 and 4. To find the integer values of x that satisfy this inequality, we need to look at the integers between -1 and 3 (since -4/3 is not an integer and we are looking for integer values of x). The integers between -1 and 3 are: -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. Therefore, there are 5 integer values of x that satisfy the inequality. The answer is (D) Five. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If x^2 \u2013 13x + 40 = q, and x is a positive integer between 1 and 10, inclusive, what is the probability that q < 0? Answer Choices: (A) 1/5 (B) 1/10 (C) 2/5 (D) 3/5 (E) 3/10\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to factor the quadratic equation x^2 \u2013 13x + 40 to find its roots: x^2 \u2013 13x + 40 = (x \u2013 5)(x \u2013 8) Therefore, the equation can be rewritten as: (x \u2013 5)(x \u2013 8) = q To find when q < 0, we need to determine when the product (x \u2013 5)(x \u2013 8) is negative. This occurs when x is between 5 and 8, exclusive, because when x is less than 5 or greater than 8, at least one of the factors is negative, making the product positive. So, out of the 10 possible values of x (1 to 10), there are 2 values (6 and 7) that satisfy the condition q < 0. Therefore, the probability is 2/10 or 1/5. The answer is (A) 1/5. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
