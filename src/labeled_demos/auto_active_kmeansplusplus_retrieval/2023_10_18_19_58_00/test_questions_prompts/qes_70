  "test_question": "Q: x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days. How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days? Answer Choices: (A) x2/y2 units (B) y3/x2 units (C) x3/y2 units (D) y2/x2 units (E) None of these",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A work which could be finished in 10 days was finished 3 days earlier after 10 more men joined. The number of men employed was? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 20 (C) 88 (D) 71 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the number of men initially employed be x. Then, the work done in 1 day by x men is 1/10 and the work done in 1 day by (x+10) men is 1/(10-3) = 1/7 (since the work was finished 3 days earlier). Now, we can set up an equation based on the work done by x men and (x+10) men: x/10 + (x+10)/7 = 1 Multiplying both sides by 70 (the least common multiple of 10 and 7) gives: 7x + 10(x+10) = 70 Simplifying and solving for x gives: 17x = 60 x = 60/17 Since x is not a whole number, none of the answer choices are correct. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: Machine E can produce x units in 3/4 of the time it takes machine N to produce x units. Machine N can produce x units in 2/3 the time it takes machine O to produce x units. If all three machines are working simultaneously, what fraction of the total output is produced by machine N? Answer Choices: (A)  1/2 (B)  1/3 (C)  4/13 (D)  8/29 (E)  6/33\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that machine O takes t time to produce x units. Then, machine N will take 2t/3 time to produce x units and machine E will take 3t/4 time to produce x units. Now, let's find the rate of production of each machine. Machine O produces x/t units per unit time. Machine N produces x/(2t/3) = 3x/(2t) units per unit time. Machine E produces x/(3t/4) = 4x/(3t) units per unit time. If all three machines are working simultaneously, then the total rate of production is the sum of the individual rates of production. So, the total rate of production is: x/t + 3x/(2t) + 4x/(3t) = (13x/6t) Therefore, machine N's contribution to the total output is: (3x/(2t)) / (13x/6t) = 9/26 So, the answer is (D) 8/29. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A part-time employee whose hourly wage was decreased by 20 percent decided to increase the number of hours worked per week so that the employee's total income did not change. By what percent E should the number of hours worked be increased? Answer Choices: (A) 12.5% (B) 20% (C) 25% (D) 50% (E) 100%\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that the employee originally worked for x hours per week and earned y dollars per week. After the wage decrease of 20%, the employee's new hourly wage is 0.8y/x dollars per hour. To maintain the same total income, the employee needs to work for more hours. Let's call the new number of hours worked per week E. The employee's new weekly income is (0.8y/x) * E dollars. We want to find the percentage increase in the number of hours worked, which is given by: (E - x)/x * 100% Setting the new weekly income equal to the original weekly income, we get: (0.8y/x) * E = y Solving for E, we get: E = 1.25x Therefore, the percentage increase in the number of hours worked is: (E - x)/x * 100% = (1.25x - x)/x * 100% = 0.25 * 100% = 25% So the answer is (C) 25%. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 25 copies per minute. A second copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 55 copies per minute. Working together at their respective rates, how many copies do the two machines make in half an hour ? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 2,400 (C) 4,500 (D) 5,400 (E) 324,000\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the combined rate of the two machines. To do this, we add their individual rates: 25 copies/minute + 55 copies/minute = 80 copies/minute Next, we need to convert half an hour to minutes: 30 minutes Now we can use the formula: rate x time = amount Plugging in the values we have: 80 copies/minute x 30 minutes = 2400 copies Therefore, the answer is (B) 2,400. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
