  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A HEXAGON IS FORMED ABCDEF WHICH PERIMETER 36cm. A POLYGON IS FORMED BY JOINING THE POINTS AE &BD . FIND THE AREA OF THE POLYGON ABDE? Answer Choices: (A) 34\u221a3 cm2 (B) 35\u221a3 cm2 (C) 36\u221a3 cm2 (D) 37\u221a3 cm2 (E) 38\u221a3 cm2\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length of each side of the hexagon. Since the perimeter is 36cm and there are six sides, each side has a length of 6cm. Next, we need to find the area of triangle ABE. We can use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is 1/2 * base * height. The base is AB, which has a length of 6cm. To find the height, we need to draw a perpendicular line from E to AB. Let's call the point where the perpendicular line intersects AB point G. Triangle AEG is a 30-60-90 triangle, so the height EG is 3\u221a3 cm. Therefore, the area of triangle ABE is 1/2 * 6cm * 3\u221a3 cm = 9\u221a3 cm2. We can use the same method to find the area of triangle BDE. The base is BD, which also has a length of 6cm. To find the height, we need to draw a perpendicular line from D to BD. Let's call the point where the perpendicular line intersects BD point H. Triangle BDH is also a 30-60-90 triangle, so the height DH is 3\u221a3 cm. Therefore, the area of triangle BDE is 1/2 * 6cm * 3\u221a3 cm = 9\u221a3 cm2. Finally, we can find the area of the polygon ABDE by adding the areas of triangles ABE and BDE. 9\u221a3 cm2 + 9\u221a3 cm2 = 18\u221a3 cm2. Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) since none of the given answer choices match our calculated answer of 18\u221a3 cm2. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: How many minutes are there in two right angles? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 22 (C) 17 (D) 2888 (E) 2880\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to understand what is meant by \"two right angles.\" A right angle is a 90-degree angle. So, two right angles would be 180 degrees. Next, we need to understand the relationship between degrees and minutes. There are 60 minutes in one degree. Therefore, to find the number of minutes in 180 degrees, we can multiply 180 by 60: 180 x 60 = 10,800 So, the answer is 10,800 minutes. None of the answer choices provided match this answer, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The sum of the heights of two high-rises is x feet. If the first high rise is 37 feet taller than the second, how tall will the second high rise be? Answer Choices: (A) (x- 37)  (B) 2x\u2212(37+z)  (C) (x\u221237) /2 + z (D) x/2 - 37 + z (E) (2x\u221237) /z\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the height of the second high-rise is z feet. According to the problem, the height of the first high-rise is 37 feet taller than the second high-rise. Therefore, the height of the first high-rise is (z+37) feet. The sum of the heights of both high-rises is x feet. Therefore, we can write an equation as: z + (z+37) = x Simplifying the equation: 2z + 37 = x Subtracting 37 from both sides: 2z = x - 37 Dividing both sides by 2: z = (x-37)/2 Therefore, the height of the second high-rise will be (x-37)/2 feet. Hence, the correct answer is (A) (x-37). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: How many 4-digit Q numbers (ABCD) can be formed such that |A \u2013 D| = 2? Answer Choices: (A) 2,000 (B) 1,900 (C) 1,800 (D) 1,600 (E) 1,500\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that |A \u2013 D| = 2. This means that A and D are either 2 digits apart or 2 digits away from each other in the number line. Case 1: A is 2 digits greater than D. In this case, we can choose any digit from 1 to 9 for D (since it's a 4-digit number, we can't have 0 as the first digit). Then, A can be any digit that is 2 greater than D, except for 9 (since we can't have a 5th digit). So, there are 8 choices for A. Case 2: D is 2 digits greater than A. This is the same as Case 1, but with A and D switched. So, there are also 8 choices for A in this case. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit Q numbers that can be formed is 8 + 8 = 16. The answer is (D) 1,600. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
