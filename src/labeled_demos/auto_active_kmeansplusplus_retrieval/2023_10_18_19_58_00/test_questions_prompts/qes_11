  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A woman sold 300 oranges at $12.10, some at the rate of 3 for 35 cents and the rest at 7 for 85 cents. How many were sold at the first rate? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 21 (C) 9 (D) 15 (E) 13\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. Let the number of oranges sold at the rate of 3 for 35 cents be x. Then, the number of oranges sold at the rate of 7 for 85 cents would be 300 - x. The total amount earned from selling x oranges at the rate of 3 for 35 cents would be (x/3) * 0.35 dollars. Similarly, the total amount earned from selling (300 - x) oranges at the rate of 7 for 85 cents would be (7/85) * (300 - x) dollars. The total amount earned from selling all 300 oranges would be $12.10. So, we can write the equation: (x/3) * 0.35 + (7/85) * (300 - x) = 12.10 Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 45 Therefore, the number of oranges sold at the rate of 3 for 35 cents is 45. Hence, the answer is (A) 45. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: By selling 300 apples a seller gains the selling price of 60 apples. The gain percent of the seller is Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 88 (C) 25 (D) 27 (E) 19\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the selling price of one apple is $1. Therefore, the selling price of 300 apples is $300 and the selling price of 60 apples is $60. The seller gains the selling price of 60 apples, which is $60. Profit percent = (Profit/Cost Price) x 100 Here, the profit is $60 and the cost price is the selling price of 240 apples (300-60), which is $240. Profit percent = (60/240) x 100 = 25% Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 25. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The average price of an antique car increases over the years. If from 1990 to 1996, the price of the car increased by 13% and from 1996 to 2001 it increased by 20%, what is the price of the car in 2001 if the price in 1990 was $11,500? Answer Choices: (A) $15,594. (B) $15,322. (C) $14,786. (D) $14,543. (E) $12,988.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the price of the car in 1996 after a 13% increase from 1990. Price in 1990 = $11,500 13% increase from 1990 = 0.13 x $11,500 = $1,495 Price in 1996 = $11,500 + $1,495 = $12,995 Next, we need to find the price of the car in 2001 after a 20% increase from 1996. 20% increase from 1996 = 0.20 x $12,995 = $2,599 Price in 2001 = $12,995 + $2,599 = $15,594 Therefore, the answer is (A) $15,594. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: If the selling price is quadrupled,the profit is pentadruple, what is the percentage of profit?? Answer Choices: (A) 50% (B) 100% (C) 150% (D) 200% (E) 250%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the cost price of the item is $100. If the selling price is quadrupled, the new selling price would be $400. Let's say the profit made at the original selling price was $x. If the profit is pentadrupled, the new profit would be $5x. Profit = Selling price - Cost price So, x = Selling price - $100 $5x = $400 - $100 $5x = $300 x = $60 Therefore, the original profit was $60 and the new profit is $300. Percentage increase in profit = (New profit - Original profit) / Original profit * 100 = (300 - 60) / 60 * 100 = 400% So, the answer is (D) 200%. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
