  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The average salary/head of all the workers ina workshop is Rs.850, if the average salary/head of 7technician is Rs.1000 and the average salary/head of the rest is Rs.780, the total no. of workers in the work-shop is ? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 23 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the total number of workers in the workshop be x. We know that the average salary/head of all workers is Rs. 850. So, the total salary of all workers = 850x. We also know that the average salary/head of 7 technicians is Rs. 1000. So, the total salary of these 7 technicians = 1000 x 7 = 7000. Now, we can find the total salary of the remaining workers by subtracting the total salary of the technicians from the total salary of all workers: Total salary of remaining workers = 850x - 7000. We also know that the average salary/head of the remaining workers is Rs. 780. So, we can set up an equation: (850x - 7000) / (x - 7) = 780 Solving for x, we get x = 22. Therefore, the total number of workers in the workshop is 22. The answer is (C) 22. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Kiran has 85 currency notes in all, some of which were of Rs. 100 denomination and the\nremaining of Rs. 50 denomination. The total amount of all these currency notes was Rs.\n5000. How much amount did she have in the denomination of Rs. 50?\nA. B. C. None of these D.\nAnswer: Option B\nExplanation: Answer Choices: (A) 1900 (B) 3500 (C) 4000 (D) 2000 (E) 2500\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the number of Rs. 100 notes be x and the number of Rs. 50 notes be y. We know that x + y = 85 (total number of notes) and 100x + 50y = 5000 (total amount). Simplifying the second equation, we get 2x + y = 100. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get x = 25 and y = 60. Therefore, the amount in the denomination of Rs. 50 is 50 * 60 = 3000. So, the correct answer is option B. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In order to obtain an income of Rs. 650 from 10% stock at Rs. 96, one must make an investment of Answer Choices: (A) 5363 (B) 6240 (C) 2368 (D) 1987 (E) 2732\nA: Let's think step by step. The annual income from the stock is 10% of the investment. So, we can set up the equation: 10% of the investment = Rs. 650 0.1 x investment = 650 investment = 650 / 0.1 investment = Rs. 6,500 Now, we need to find out how many shares can be bought with an investment of Rs. 6,500 at Rs. 96 per share. Number of shares = investment / share price Number of shares = 6,500 / 96 Number of shares = 67.71 (approx.) Since we cannot buy a fraction of a share, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Number of shares = 68 Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 2732, which is the total investment required to buy 68 shares at Rs. 96 per share. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A salesman\u2019s terms were changed from a flat commission of 5% on all his sales to a fixed salary of Rs.900 plus 2.5% commission on all sales exceeding Rs. 4,000. If his remuneration as per new scheme was Rs. 600 more than that by the previous schema, his sales were worth? Answer Choices: (A) 10000 (B) 12000 (C) 12019 (D) 12197 (E) 12012\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the salesman's sales be x. Under the previous scheme, his commission would be 5% of x, which is 0.05x. Under the new scheme, his commission on sales exceeding Rs. 4,000 would be 2.5% of (x-4000), which is 0.025(x-4000). In addition, he has a fixed salary of Rs. 900. So his remuneration under the new scheme would be: 0.025(x-4000) + 900 And we know that this is Rs. 600 more than his remuneration under the previous scheme, which was 0.05x. So we can set up an equation: 0.025(x-4000) + 900 = 0.05x + 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.025x - 100 + 900 = 0.05x + 600 0.025x + 800 = 0.05x + 600 0.025x = 200 x = 8000 Therefore, his sales were worth Rs. 8,000. None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
