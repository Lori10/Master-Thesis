  "test_question": "Q: A special cereal mixture contains rice, wheat and corn in the ratio of 2:3:5. If a bag of the mixture contains 3 pounds of rice, how much corn does it contain? Answer Choices: (A) 6.5 (B) 7.5 (C) 7 (D) 6 (E) None of the above",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: the ratio of water and milk is 2:3.after adding 4litre milk ratio become 1:2? calculate amount of water? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 8 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. Initially, let's assume that the amount of water in the mixture is 2x and the amount of milk is 3x. So, the total amount of the mixture is 2x + 3x = 5x. After adding 4 liters of milk, the total amount of the mixture becomes 5x + 4. Now, the ratio of water to milk is 1:2, which means the amount of water is x and the amount of milk is 2x. So, we can write the equation as: 2x + 4 = 2(2x) Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x + 4 = 4x 2x = 4 x = 2 Therefore, the amount of water in the mixture initially was 2x = 2(2) = 4 liters. So, the correct answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the calculated answer. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A bag of potatoes weighs 36 lbs divided by half of its weight. How much does the bag of potatoes weight? Answer Choices: (A) 20 lb (B) 30 lb (C) 10 lb (D) 15 lb (E) 36 lb\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find half of the weight of the bag of potatoes. We can represent this as 1/2x, where x is the weight of the bag of potatoes. Next, we know that the bag of potatoes weighs 36 lbs divided by half of its weight. We can represent this as: 36 = x/(1/2x) To simplify this equation, we can multiply both sides by 2x: 72x = x Now we can solve for x: 72x = x 71x = 0 x = 0 This doesn't make sense, as the weight of the bag of potatoes cannot be 0. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. Answer: None of the above. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: Arun purchased 30 kg of wheat at the rate of Rs. 11.50 per kg and 20 kg of wheat at the rate of 14.25 per kg. He mixed the two and sold the mixture. Approximately what price per kg should be sell the mixture to make 35% profit? Answer Choices: (A) 16.39 (B) 16.33 (C) 16.35 (D) 17.01 (E) 16.32\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost price of the wheat that Arun purchased: Cost price of 30 kg of wheat = 30 x 11.50 = Rs. 345 Cost price of 20 kg of wheat = 20 x 14.25 = Rs. 285 Total cost price = 345 + 285 = Rs. 630 Now, Arun wants to make a 35% profit on this cost price. So, the selling price of the mixture should be: Selling price = Cost price + Profit Profit = 35% of Cost price = 0.35 x 630 = Rs. 220.50 Selling price = 630 + 220.50 = Rs. 850.50 Finally, we need to find the price per kg of the mixture. Arun has a total of 50 kg of wheat (30 kg + 20 kg), so: Price per kg = Selling price / Total quantity Price per kg = 850.50 / 50 = Rs. 17.01 Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 17.01. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Elena\u2019s bread recipe calls for 2 ounces of butter for each 5 cups of flour used. She needs to make 4 times the original recipe. If 12 ounces of butter is used, then how many cups of flour are needed? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 4 (C) 9 (D) 13 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much butter is needed for the new recipe. Since Elena needs to make 4 times the original recipe, she will need 4 x 2 = 8 ounces of butter. Next, we can set up a proportion to find out how much flour is needed. We know that for every 2 ounces of butter, 5 cups of flour are used. So, we can write: 2/5 = 8/x where x is the number of cups of flour needed for the new recipe. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 2x = 40 x = 20 Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
