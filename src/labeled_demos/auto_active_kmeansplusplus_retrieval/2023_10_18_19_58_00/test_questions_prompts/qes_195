  "test_question": "Q: A certain liquid passes through a drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. At that rate, how many minutes will it take y gallons to pass through the drain? Answer Choices: (A) y/(1200xy)  (B) 20xy/w (C) 5xy/(12w)  (D) w/(3xy)  (E) 3y/(wx) ",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Five drainage pipes, each draining water from a pool at the same constant rate, together can drain a certain pool in 12 days. How many additional pipes, each draining water at the same constant rate, will be needed to drain the pool in 6 days? Answer Choices: (A)  5 (B)  9 (C)  10 (D)  12 (E)  15\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to understand that the rate of draining water is constant for each pipe. Let's say the rate of each pipe is x. We know that 5 pipes can drain the pool in 12 days. So, the total amount of water in the pool is 5x * 12 = 60x. Now, we want to drain the same pool in half the time, which is 6 days. So, the total amount of water drained should be the same, which is 60x. Let's say we need n additional pipes to drain the pool in 6 days. So, the total number of pipes will be 5 + n. We can use the formula: total amount of water drained = rate * time 60x = (5 + n) * x * 6 Simplifying this equation, we get: 60x = 30x + 6nx 30x = 6nx n = 5 Therefore, we need 5 additional pipes to drain the pool in 6 days. The answer is (A) 5. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: If John takes 4 minutes to eat x raisins, how many seconds will it take him to eat z raisins, assuming he continues to eat at the same rate? Answer Choices: (A) 240z/x (B) 4xz (C) 240x/z (D) 240xz (E) 4z/x\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many raisins John can eat in one minute. We can do this by dividing x by 4 (since he eats x raisins in 4 minutes): x/4 Now we need to find out how many seconds it will take him to eat z raisins. We can set up a proportion: x/4 = z/t where t is the time it takes him to eat z raisins in seconds. We can solve for t: t = 4z/x Therefore, the answer is (E) 4z/x. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A pump can fill a tank with water in 2 hours. Because of a leak, it took 2 hours to fill the tank. The leak can drain all the water of the tank in: Answer Choices: (A) 4 hours (B) 7 hours (C) 8 hours (D) 14 hours (E) 15 hours\nA: Let's think step by step. The pump can fill the tank in 2 hours, so in 1 hour it can fill 1/2 of the tank. Let's assume the leak can drain the entire tank in x hours. In 2 hours, the pump fills the entire tank, but during this time the leak also drains some water. Let's say the leak drains 1/2 of the tank in 2 hours. So, in 2 hours, the pump fills 1/2 of the tank and the leak drains 1/2 of the tank. This means that the net amount of water added to the tank in 2 hours is 0. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 1/2 - 1/x = 0 Solving for x, we get: 1/x = 1/2 x = 2 Therefore, the leak can drain the entire tank in 2 hours. The correct answer is (A) 4 hours. None of the given options match the correct answer. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The difference between a positive proper fraction and its reciprocal is 9/20. The fraction is? Answer Choices: (A) 4/5 (B) 4/7 (C) 5 (D) 5/7 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the fraction be x/y. According to the problem, x/y - y/x = 9/20 Multiplying both sides by xy, we get x^2 - y^2 = 9xy/20 Simplifying, 20x^2 - 20y^2 = 9xy 20x^2 - 9xy - 20y^2 = 0 We can factor this as (4x - 5y)(5x + 4y) = 0 So either 4x - 5y = 0 or 5x + 4y = 0. If 4x - 5y = 0, then x/y = 5/4. If 5x + 4y = 0, then x/y = -4/5, but this is not a positive proper fraction. Therefore, the answer is (A) 4/5. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
