  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If 100<x<199 and 9<y<100, then the product xy CANNOT be equal to: Answer Choices: (A) 19,104 (B) 19,303 (C) 19,956.732 (D) 19,502 (E) 19,809\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 100 < x < 199 and 9 < y < 100. Therefore, the minimum value of xy occurs when x is at its minimum value of 101 and y is at its minimum value of 10. So, the minimum value of xy is 101 * 10 = 1010. Now, let's check each answer choice to see if it is possible for xy to equal that value: (A) 19,104 = 96 * 199, which is not possible since y must be less than 100. (B) 19,303 = 97 * 199, which is not possible since y must be less than 100. (C) 19,956.732 is not a whole number, so it is not possible. (D) 19,502 = 98 * 199, which is not possible since y must be less than 100. (E) 19,809 = 99 * 201, which is possible since both x and y are within the given ranges. Therefore, the answer is (E) 19,809. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Let f(x,y) be defined as the remainder when (x\u2013y)! is divided by x. If x=16, what is the maximum value of y for which f(x,y)=0? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 10 (C) 15 (D) 20 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the value of (x-y)!. Since x=16, we have (16-y)!. Next, we need to find the remainder when (16-y)! is divided by 16. This means we need to find the largest value of y such that (16-y)! is divisible by 16. We know that 16=2^4, so we need to find the largest power of 2 that divides (16-y)!. We can use the formula for the highest power of a prime p that divides n!, which is given by: \u230an/p\u230b + \u230an/p^2\u230b + \u230an/p^3\u230b + ... where \u230ax\u230b denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. In this case, p=2 and n=16-y, so we have: \u230a(16-y)/2\u230b + \u230a(16-y)/4\u230b + \u230a(16-y)/8\u230b + \u230a(16-y)/16\u230b Simplifying this expression, we get: 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15 So the largest power of 2 that divides (16-y)! is 2^15. Therefore, the maximum value of y for which f(x,y)=0 is 15. The answer is (C) 15. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: How many integer values W are there for x such that 1 < 3x + 5 < 17? Answer Choices: (A) Two (B) Three (C) Four (D) Five (E) Six\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to isolate x in the inequality. 1 < 3x + 5 < 17 Subtract 5 from all parts of the inequality: -4 < 3x < 12 Divide all parts of the inequality by 3: -4/3 < x < 4 Now we know that x must be between -4/3 and 4. To find the integer values of x that satisfy this inequality, we need to look at the integers between -1 and 3 (since -4/3 is not an integer and we are looking for integer values of x). The integers between -1 and 3 are: -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. Therefore, there are 5 integer values of x that satisfy the inequality. The answer is (D) Five. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Which of the following inequalities has a solution set, when graphed on the number line, is a single line segment of finite length? Answer Choices: (A) 2 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (B) 3 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (C) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (D) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (E) 4 <= 3x+4 <= 6\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to isolate the variable (x) in the inequality. We can do this by subtracting 4 from all parts of the inequality: (A) 2 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes -2 <= 3x <= 2 (B) 3 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes -1 <= 3x <= 2 (C) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes 1 <= 3x <= 2 (D) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes 1 <= 3x <= 2 (E) 4 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes 0 <= 3x <= 2 Now we can divide all parts of the inequality by 3: (A) -2/3 <= x <= 2/3 (B) -1/3 <= x <= 2/3 (C) 1/3 <= x <= 2/3 (D) 1/3 <= x <= 2/3 (E) 0 <= x <= 2/3 Option (C) has a solution set that is a single line segment of finite length, from x=1/3 to x=2/3. Therefore, the correct answer is (C). The answer is C.\n\n\n"
