  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 25 copies per minute. A second copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 55 copies per minute. Working together at their respective rates, how many copies do the two machines make in half an hour ? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 2,400 (C) 4,500 (D) 5,400 (E) 324,000\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the combined rate of the two machines. To do this, we add their individual rates: 25 copies/minute + 55 copies/minute = 80 copies/minute Next, we need to convert half an hour to minutes: 30 minutes Now we can use the formula: rate x time = amount Plugging in the values we have: 80 copies/minute x 30 minutes = 2400 copies Therefore, the answer is (B) 2,400. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: What would happen in the previous question if both A and B had started at point P. Answer Choices: (A) 800 Km (B) 600 Km (C) 1000 Km (D) 350 Km (E) 250 Km\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that A travels at a speed of 50 km/h and B travels at a speed of 40 km/h. If they both started at point P, they would be moving in opposite directions. Let's say they meet after x hours. In that time, A would have traveled 50x km and B would have traveled 40x km. We also know that the distance between A and B is 600 km. So, we can set up the equation: 50x + 40x = 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 90x = 600 x = 6.67 hours Now that we know they meet after 6.67 hours, we can find out how far each of them has traveled: A: 50 km/h x 6.67 h = 333.33 km B: 40 km/h x 6.67 h = 266.67 km The total distance they have traveled is: 333.33 km + 266.67 km = 600 km Therefore, the answer is (B) 600 km. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Machine E can produce x units in 3/4 of the time it takes machine N to produce x units. Machine N can produce x units in 2/3 the time it takes machine O to produce x units. If all three machines are working simultaneously, what fraction of the total output is produced by machine N? Answer Choices: (A)  1/2 (B)  1/3 (C)  4/13 (D)  8/29 (E)  6/33\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that machine O takes t time to produce x units. Then, machine N will take 2t/3 time to produce x units and machine E will take 3t/4 time to produce x units. Now, let's find the rate of production of each machine. Machine O produces x/t units per unit time. Machine N produces x/(2t/3) = 3x/(2t) units per unit time. Machine E produces x/(3t/4) = 4x/(3t) units per unit time. If all three machines are working simultaneously, then the total rate of production is the sum of the individual rates of production. So, the total rate of production is: x/t + 3x/(2t) + 4x/(3t) = (13x/6t) Therefore, machine N's contribution to the total output is: (3x/(2t)) / (13x/6t) = 9/26 So, the answer is (D) 8/29. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: In a game of billiards, A can give B 20 points in 60 and he can give C 30 points in 60. How many points can B give C in a game of 120? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 77 (C) 45 (D) 18 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many points A can give B in a game of 120. We can use the ratio of 20 points in 60 to find out how many points A can give B in 120. 20 points in 60 minutes is equivalent to (20/60) = 1/3 points per minute. Therefore, in 120 minutes, A can give B (1/3 x 120) = 40 points. Now, we need to find out how many points A can give C in a game of 120. Using the same method as above, we get: 30 points in 60 minutes is equivalent to (30/60) = 1/2 points per minute. Therefore, in 120 minutes, A can give C (1/2 x 120) = 60 points. Now, we need to find out how many points B can give C in a game of 120. Let's assume that B can give C x points in 120 minutes. In 120 minutes, A can give B 40 points and A can give C 60 points. Therefore, B can give C (60 - 40) = 20 points in 120 minutes. Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match our calculation. The correct answer is 20. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
