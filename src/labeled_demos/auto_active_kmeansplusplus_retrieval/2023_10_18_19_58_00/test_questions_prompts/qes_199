  "test_question": "Q: The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers? Answer Choices: (A) 47 (B) 91 (C) 41 (D) 67 (E) 44",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Find the odd man out. 187, 264, 316, 473, 682, 781 Answer Choices: (A) 187 (B) 316 (C) 781 (D) 682 (E) 473\nA: Let's think step by step. The numbers seem random, so we need to find a pattern or rule that applies to all except one of the numbers. If we look at the last digit of each number, we can see that they alternate between odd and even: 7, 4, 6, 3, 2, 1. However, this pattern doesn't apply to 316, which ends in an even digit. Therefore, the odd man out is (B) 316. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Adding two non multiples of E always results in a multiple of E; which of the following must be the value of E ? Answer Choices: (A) [A] two (B) [B] three (C) [C] five (D) [D] ten (E) [E] hundred\nA: Let's think step by step. If adding two non-multiples of E always results in a multiple of E, then E must be a common factor of those two numbers. Let's try each option and see if it works: (A) Two: Adding two non-multiples of 2 always results in an even number, which is a multiple of 2. This option could be correct. (B) Three: Adding two non-multiples of 3 does not always result in a multiple of 3. For example, 1 + 5 = 6, which is a multiple of 3, but 1 and 5 are both non-multiples of 3. This option is not correct. (C) Five: Adding two non-multiples of 5 always results in a multiple of 5. This option could be correct. (D) Ten: Adding two non-multiples of 10 always results in a multiple of 10. This option could be correct. (E) Hundred: Adding two non-multiples of 100 always results in a multiple of 100. This option could be correct. Therefore, the correct answer is either (A) two, (C) five, (D) ten, or (E) hundred. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: If y is the smallest positive integer such that 6300 multiplied by y is the square of an integer, then y must be Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 7 (C) 15 (D) 35 (E) 45\nA: Let's think step by step. We need to find the smallest positive integer y such that 6300 multiplied by y is the square of an integer. Let's factor 6300: 6300 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2 * 7 To be a perfect square, each prime factor must have an even exponent. Therefore, we need to add one factor of 7 to make the exponent of 7 even. So, y = 7. Therefore, the answer is (B) 7. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Find the invalid no.from the following series 10, 17, 22, 29, 34, 36 Answer Choices: (A) 36 (B) 18 (C) 40 (D) 37 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. The given series is 10, 17, 22, 29, 34, 36. To find the invalid number, we need to identify the pattern in the series. The pattern is that each number is obtained by adding 5 or 7 to the previous number. 10 + 7 = 17 17 + 5 = 22 22 + 7 = 29 29 + 5 = 34 34 + 2 = 36 The invalid number is 36 because it is not obtained by adding 5 or 7 to the previous number. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 36. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
