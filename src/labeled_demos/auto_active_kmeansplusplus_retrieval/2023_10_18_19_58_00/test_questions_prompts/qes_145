  "formatted_prompt": "Q: 54.327 \u00d7 357.2 \u00d7 0.0057 is the same as : Answer Choices: (A) 5.4327 \u00d7 3.572 \u00d7 5.7 (B) 5.4327 \u00d7 3.572 \u00d7 0.57 (C) 5.4327 \u00d7 3.572 \u00d7 0.0000057 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can multiply 54.327 and 357.2 to get 19416.8104. Then, we can multiply that result by 0.0057 to get 110.8345248. Therefore, the answer is (C) 5.4327 \u00d7 3.572 \u00d7 0.0000057. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If w = 9/25, c = 15/32, and m + w + c = 1, which of the following gives the values of m, w, and c in increasing order? Answer Choices: (A) c, m, w (B) c, w, m (C) m, w, c (D) w, c, m (E) w, m, c\nA: Let's think step by step. Given, w = 9/25, c = 15/32, and m + w + c = 1. We need to find the values of m, w, and c in increasing order. We can rearrange the equation m + w + c = 1 to get m = 1 - w - c. Substituting the given values of w and c, we get m = 1 - 9/25 - 15/32. Simplifying, we get m = 223/800. Now we can compare the values of m, w, and c to find the correct order. w = 9/25 = 288/800 c = 15/32 = 375/800 So, the correct order is: w, m, c Therefore, the answer is (E) w, m, c. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: The area of a square is 4225 sq cm. Find the ratio of the breadth and the length of a rectangle whose length is twice the side of the square and breadth is 24 cm less than the side of the square. Answer Choices: (A) 5:28 (B) 5:19 (C) 5:12 (D) 5:13 (E) 41:130\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the side of the square. We know that the area of the square is 4225 sq cm, so we can find the side by taking the square root of the area: Side of square = \u221a4225 = 65 cm Next, we need to find the length and breadth of the rectangle. We are given that the length is twice the side of the square, so: Length of rectangle = 2 x 65 = 130 cm We are also given that the breadth is 24 cm less than the side of the square, so: Breadth of rectangle = 65 - 24 = 41 cm Now, we need to find the ratio of the breadth and the length of the rectangle. Ratio of breadth to length = 41:130 Simplifying this ratio by dividing both sides by 41, we get: 1:3.17 Multiplying both sides by 5 to get rid of the decimal, we get: 5:15.83 Rounding off to the nearest whole number, we get: 5:16 Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: (A% of 5B + B% of A) is equal to ? Answer Choices: (A) A% of B (B) B% of A (C) 6% of AB (D) AB% of 3 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. We can start by simplifying the expression given in the question: (A% of 5B + B% of A) = (A/100 * 5B) + (B/100 * A) = AB/20 + AB/100 Now, we can try to simplify this expression further: AB/20 + AB/100 = (5AB + AB)/100 = 6AB/100 = 6% of AB Therefore, the answer is (C) 6% of AB. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
