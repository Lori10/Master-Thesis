  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Kiran has 85 currency notes in all, some of which were of Rs. 100 denomination and the\nremaining of Rs. 50 denomination. The total amount of all these currency notes was Rs.\n5000. How much amount did she have in the denomination of Rs. 50?\nA. B. C. None of these D.\nAnswer: Option B\nExplanation: Answer Choices: (A) 1900 (B) 3500 (C) 4000 (D) 2000 (E) 2500\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the number of Rs. 100 notes be x and the number of Rs. 50 notes be y. We know that x + y = 85 (total number of notes) and 100x + 50y = 5000 (total amount). Simplifying the second equation, we get 2x + y = 100. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get x = 25 and y = 60. Therefore, the amount in the denomination of Rs. 50 is 50 * 60 = 3000. So, the correct answer is option B. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In a game, a person is declared winner, if he gets 4 consecutive tails in five throws of a coin. What is the probability of A to win if he has got a tail in the first throw? Answer Choices: (A) 1/5 (B) 1/4 (C) 1/8 (D) 1/16 (E) 1/6\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that A has already gotten a tail in the first throw. Now, in order to win, A needs to get 3 more consecutive tails in the next 4 throws. The probability of getting a tail in any given throw is 1/2 (assuming a fair coin). So, the probability of getting 4 consecutive tails in 5 throws can be calculated as follows: Probability = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/32 However, we need to take into account that A has already gotten a tail in the first throw. So, we only need to consider the probability of getting 3 consecutive tails in the next 4 throws. Probability = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16 Therefore, the probability of A winning if he has already gotten a tail in the first throw is 1/16. The correct answer is (D) 1/16. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A woman sold 300 oranges at $12.10, some at the rate of 3 for 35 cents and the rest at 7 for 85 cents. How many were sold at the first rate? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 21 (C) 9 (D) 15 (E) 13\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. Let the number of oranges sold at the rate of 3 for 35 cents be x. Then, the number of oranges sold at the rate of 7 for 85 cents would be 300 - x. The total amount earned from selling x oranges at the rate of 3 for 35 cents would be (x/3) * 0.35 dollars. Similarly, the total amount earned from selling (300 - x) oranges at the rate of 7 for 85 cents would be (7/85) * (300 - x) dollars. The total amount earned from selling all 300 oranges would be $12.10. So, we can write the equation: (x/3) * 0.35 + (7/85) * (300 - x) = 12.10 Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 45 Therefore, the number of oranges sold at the rate of 3 for 35 cents is 45. Hence, the answer is (A) 45. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A, B and C rent a pasture. A puts 10 oxen for 7 months, B puts 12 oxen for 5 months and C puts 15 oxen for 3 months for grazing. If the rent of the pasture is Rs. 245, how much must C pay as his share of rent? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 50 (C) 55 (D) 63 (E) none\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of oxen-months contributed by all three people. A contributed 10 oxen for 7 months, so that's 10 x 7 = 70 oxen-months. B contributed 12 oxen for 5 months, so that's 12 x 5 = 60 oxen-months. C contributed 15 oxen for 3 months, so that's 15 x 3 = 45 oxen-months. The total number of oxen-months is 70 + 60 + 45 = 175. Now we need to find out what fraction of the total rent C should pay. C contributed 45 oxen-months out of a total of 175, which is 45/175. To find out how much C should pay, we need to multiply this fraction by the total rent: (45/175) x 245 = 63 So C should pay Rs. 63 as his share of the rent. The correct answer is (D) 63. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
