  "test_question": "Q: All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If \"COMPUTER\" was given a code of 111, then what is the sum of \"VIRUS\" and \"WORM\"? Answer Choices: (A) 123 (B) 22 (C) 20 (D) 160 (E) 158\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine the code for \"VIRUS\" and \"WORM\". We are not given any information about the code for individual letters, so we cannot determine this directly. However, we do know that \"COMPUTER\" has a code of 111. We can use this information to try and find a relationship between the letters in \"COMPUTER\" and the letters in \"VIRUS\" and \"WORM\". One possible relationship is that the code for each letter in \"VIRUS\" and \"WORM\" is equal to the code for the corresponding letter in \"COMPUTER\" plus a certain constant. Let's call this constant \"k\". Using this relationship, we can set up two equations: V + k + I + k + R + k + U + k + S + k = ? W + k + O + k + R + k + M + k = ? We don't know the values of \"k\" or the sum of the codes, but we can simplify the equations by combining like terms: (5k + V + I + R + U + S) = ? (4k + W + O + R + M) = ? We still don't have enough information to solve for the sum of the codes, but we can use the fact that the sum of the codes is a multiple of 3 (since 111 is a multiple of 3). Looking at the simplified equations, we can see that the sum of the letters in \"VIRUS\" is 5 + V + I + R + U + S, which is odd (since 5 is odd). Therefore, the sum of the letters in \"WORM\" must be even in order for the sum of the codes to be a multiple of 3. The only answer choice that is even is (C) 20. Therefore, the answer is (C) 20. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A mailman puts .05% of letters in the wrong mailbox. How many deliveries must he make to misdeliver 2 items? Answer Choices: (A) 4000 (B) 400 (C) 40 (D) 40000 (E) 4500\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert .05% to a decimal, which is 0.0005. This represents the probability of a letter being misdelivered. Let's call the number of deliveries the mailman makes \"x\". We want to find the value of x that results in 2 misdelivered items. To set up the equation, we can use the formula for probability: probability = number of desired outcomes / total number of outcomes In this case, the desired outcome is 2 misdelivered items, and the total number of outcomes is the number of deliveries the mailman makes (x). So we can write: 0.0005x = 2 To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.0005: x = 2 / 0.0005 x = 4000 Therefore, the answer is (A) 4000. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: In a recent survey 40% houses contained two or more people. Of those houses containing only one person 25% were having only a male. What is the percentage of all houses which contain exactly one female and no males? Answer Choices: (A) 75 (B) 40 (C) 15 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 40% of houses contain two or more people. This means that 60% of houses contain only one person. Of those houses containing only one person, 25% were having only a male. This means that 75% of houses containing only one person were either female-only or had both male and female occupants. We want to find the percentage of all houses which contain exactly one female and no males. We know that 75% of houses containing only one person were either female-only or had both male and female occupants. Therefore, the percentage of houses containing exactly one female and no males is the remaining percentage of houses containing only one person, which is: 100% - 75% = 25% Therefore, the answer is not listed in the answer choices. The correct answer is: (E) None of these The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: If the numbers 1 to 97 are written on 97 pieces of paper, (one on each) and one piece is picked at random, then What is the probability that the number drawn is neither prime nor composite? Answer Choices: (A) 1/50 (B) 1/25 (C) 1/97 (D) 1 (E) 2\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to understand what is meant by \"neither prime nor composite.\" A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself (e.g. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). A composite number is a number that is not prime and has more than two factors (e.g. 4, 6, 8, 9, 10). Therefore, a number that is neither prime nor composite is a number that has exactly two factors (1 and itself), which is only possible for the number 1. So, out of the numbers 1 to 97, only the number 1 is neither prime nor composite. Therefore, the probability of picking the number 1 is 1/97. Answer: (C) 1/97. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
