  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If x^2 \u2013 13x + 40 = q, and x is a positive integer between 1 and 10, inclusive, what is the probability that q < 0? Answer Choices: (A) 1/5 (B) 1/10 (C) 2/5 (D) 3/5 (E) 3/10\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to factor the quadratic equation x^2 \u2013 13x + 40 to find its roots: x^2 \u2013 13x + 40 = (x \u2013 5)(x \u2013 8) Therefore, the equation can be rewritten as: (x \u2013 5)(x \u2013 8) = q To find when q < 0, we need to determine when the product (x \u2013 5)(x \u2013 8) is negative. This occurs when x is between 5 and 8, exclusive, because when x is less than 5 or greater than 8, at least one of the factors is negative, making the product positive. So, out of the 10 possible values of x (1 to 10), there are 2 values (6 and 7) that satisfy the condition q < 0. Therefore, the probability is 2/10 or 1/5. The answer is (A) 1/5. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A numberais squared and then multiplied by negative 3. The result of this operation T is equal to three times the sum of three timesaand two. What is one possible value ofa? Answer Choices: (A) -3 (B) -2 (C) 1 (D) 2 (E) 3\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's translate the given information into an equation. a^2 * (-3) = 3(3a + 2) Simplifying the right side of the equation: a^2 * (-3) = 9a + 6 Multiplying both sides by -1 to get rid of the negative coefficient: a^2 * 3 = -9a - 6 Bringing all terms to one side: a^2 * 3 + 9a + 6 = 0 Now we can solve for a using the quadratic formula: a = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a a = (-9 \u00b1 sqrt(9^2 - 4(3)(6))) / 2(3) a = (-9 \u00b1 sqrt(57)) / 6 a \u2248 -2.07 or a \u2248 -1.26 Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: Find the value for m?\n19(m + n) + 17 = 19(-m + n) - 173 Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) -1 (C) -5 (D) 2 (E) 3\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can simplify both sides of the equation by distributing the 19: 19m + 19n + 17 = -19m + 19n - 173 Next, we can move all the m terms to one side and all the constant terms to the other side: 19m + 19m = -173 - 17 - 19n + 19n 38m = -190 Finally, we can solve for m by dividing both sides by 38: m = -5 Therefore, the answer is (C) -5. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Let f(x) = x^2 + bx + c. If f(6) = 0 and f(-2) = 0, then b + c = Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 15 (C) -16 (D) -21 (E) -24\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that f(6) = 0 and f(-2) = 0. This means that when x = 6 and x = -2, the function f(x) equals zero. Using this information, we can set up two equations: (1) 6^2 + 6b + c = 0 (2) (-2)^2 - 2b + c = 0 Simplifying these equations: (1) 36 + 6b + c = 0 (2) 4 - 2b + c = 0 Now we can solve for b + c by adding the two equations together: 40 + 4b = 0 b = -10 Substituting b = -10 into either of the two equations above, we can solve for c: 36 + 6(-10) + c = 0 c = -6 Therefore, b + c = -10 - 6 = -16 The correct answer is (C) -16. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
