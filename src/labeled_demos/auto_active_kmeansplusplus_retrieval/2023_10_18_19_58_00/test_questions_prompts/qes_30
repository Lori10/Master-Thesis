  "test_question": "Q: Two numbers are said to be relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. Set S contains the set of integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If the numbers 1 to 97 are written on 97 pieces of paper, (one on each) and one piece is picked at random, then What is the probability that the number drawn is neither prime nor composite? Answer Choices: (A) 1/50 (B) 1/25 (C) 1/97 (D) 1 (E) 2\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to understand what is meant by \"neither prime nor composite.\" A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself (e.g. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). A composite number is a number that is not prime and has more than two factors (e.g. 4, 6, 8, 9, 10). Therefore, a number that is neither prime nor composite is a number that has exactly two factors (1 and itself), which is only possible for the number 1. So, out of the numbers 1 to 97, only the number 1 is neither prime nor composite. Therefore, the probability of picking the number 1 is 1/97. Answer: (C) 1/97. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A number is said to be prime saturated if the product of all the different positive prime factors of e is less than the square root of e. What is the greatest two digit prime saturated integer ? Answer Choices: (A) 99 (B) 98 (C) 97 (D) 96 (E) 95\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. First, we need to find all the prime factors of a number. Second, we need to find the product of all the different prime factors. Third, we need to compare this product with the square root of the number. Fourth, we need to repeat this process for all two-digit numbers and find the greatest prime saturated integer. Let's start with the first step. The prime numbers less than or equal to 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Any two-digit number that is not divisible by these primes is not prime saturated. Let's try 98. The prime factors of 98 are 2 and 7. The product of these primes is 14, which is less than the square root of 98 (which is approximately 9.9). Therefore, 98 is prime saturated. Let's try 99. The prime factors of 99 are 3 and 11. The product of these primes is 33, which is greater than the square root of 99 (which is approximately 9.95). Therefore, 99 is not prime saturated. Let's try 97. 97 is a prime number, so its only prime factor is itself. The product of this prime is 97, which is less than the square root of 97 (which is approximately 9.85). Therefore, 97 is prime saturated. Let's try 96. The prime factors of 96 are 2, 3, and 5. The product of these primes is 30, which is less than the square root of 96 (which is approximately 9.8). Therefore, 96 is prime saturated. Let's try 95. The prime factors of 95 are 5 and 19. The product of these primes is 95, which is equal to the square root of 95. Therefore, 95 is not prime saturated. Therefore, the greatest prime saturated two-digit integer is 98, which is option (B). The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Adding two non multiples of E always results in a multiple of E; which of the following must be the value of E ? Answer Choices: (A) [A] two (B) [B] three (C) [C] five (D) [D] ten (E) [E] hundred\nA: Let's think step by step. If adding two non-multiples of E always results in a multiple of E, then E must be a common factor of those two numbers. Let's try each option and see if it works: (A) Two: Adding two non-multiples of 2 always results in an even number, which is a multiple of 2. This option could be correct. (B) Three: Adding two non-multiples of 3 does not always result in a multiple of 3. For example, 1 + 5 = 6, which is a multiple of 3, but 1 and 5 are both non-multiples of 3. This option is not correct. (C) Five: Adding two non-multiples of 5 always results in a multiple of 5. This option could be correct. (D) Ten: Adding two non-multiples of 10 always results in a multiple of 10. This option could be correct. (E) Hundred: Adding two non-multiples of 100 always results in a multiple of 100. This option could be correct. Therefore, the correct answer is either (A) two, (C) five, (D) ten, or (E) hundred. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: If the LCM of 9, 7, 2, and q is 504, which of the following could be q? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 6 (D) 9 (E) 5\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the prime factorization of 504: 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7 Next, we need to make sure that q is a factor of 504. Since 504 is divisible by 9, 7, and 2, q must also be a factor of 504. Option A: 7 is already a factor of 504, so it could be q. Option B: 8 is not a factor of 504. Option C: 6 is a factor of 504, but it is not the least common multiple of 9, 7, and 2. Option D: 9 is already a factor of 504, so it could be q. Option E: 5 is not a factor of 504. Therefore, the possible values of q are 7 and 9. Answer: (A) 7 or (D) 9. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
