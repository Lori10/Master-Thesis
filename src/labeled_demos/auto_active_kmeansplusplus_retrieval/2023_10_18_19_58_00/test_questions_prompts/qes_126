  "test_question": "Q: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 27 (C) 29 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of the above",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Rose is two years older than Bruce who is twice as old as Chris. If the total of the age of Rose, B and Chris be 47 years, then how old is Bruce ? Answer Choices: (A) 18 years (B) 10 years (C) 12 years (D) 13 years (E) 14 years\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's start by assigning variables to the ages of Bruce and Chris. Let's say Bruce's age is B and Chris's age is C. According to the problem, Rose is two years older than Bruce, so her age can be represented as B + 2. We also know that Bruce is twice as old as Chris, so we can write: B = 2C Now we can substitute B = 2C into the equation for the total of their ages: (B + 2) + B + C = 47 Simplifying this equation: 2B + C = 45 Substituting B = 2C: 4C + C = 45 5C = 45 C = 9 Now we can find Bruce's age: B = 2C = 2(9) = 18 So the answer is (A) 18 years. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Current ages of Rahim and Thomas are in the ratio of 5 : 4 correspondingly. 0.7 decades hence, the ratio of their ages will become 11 : 9 correspondingly, What is Thomas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current age in years? Answer Choices: (A) 24 years (B) 44 years (C) 34 years (D) 64 years (E) 84 years\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that Rahim's current age is 5x and Thomas's current age is 4x. 0.7 decades hence means 7 years. So, after 7 years, Rahim's age will be 5x + 7 and Thomas's age will be 4x + 7. According to the problem, the ratio of their ages after 7 years will be 11:9. Therefore, we can write the equation: (5x + 7)/(4x + 7) = 11/9 Cross-multiplying, we get: 99x + 77 = 44x + 77 55x = 0 x = 0 This is not possible, so there must be an error in the problem. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: How many 4-digit Q numbers (ABCD) can be formed such that |A \u2013 D| = 2? Answer Choices: (A) 2,000 (B) 1,900 (C) 1,800 (D) 1,600 (E) 1,500\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that |A \u2013 D| = 2. This means that A and D are either 2 digits apart or 2 digits away from each other in the number line. Case 1: A is 2 digits greater than D. In this case, we can choose any digit from 1 to 9 for D (since it's a 4-digit number, we can't have 0 as the first digit). Then, A can be any digit that is 2 greater than D, except for 9 (since we can't have a 5th digit). So, there are 8 choices for A. Case 2: D is 2 digits greater than A. This is the same as Case 1, but with A and D switched. So, there are also 8 choices for A in this case. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit Q numbers that can be formed is 8 + 8 = 16. The answer is (D) 1,600. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A father said to his son, \"I was as old as you are at the present at the time of your birth\". If the father's age is 38 years now, the son's age five years back was: Answer Choices: (A) 24 years (B) 33 years (C) 14 years (D) 18 years (E) 9 years\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the son's current age be x. According to the problem, the father's age at the time of the son's birth was x. Therefore, the father's current age is x + 38 (since the son's current age is x). We need to find the son's age 5 years back, which would be x - 5. Now, we can set up an equation: x - 5 = 38 - x Solving for x, we get: 2x = 43 x = 21.5 Therefore, the son's age 5 years back was: 21.5 - 5 = 16.5 None of the answer choices match this result, so the answer is: None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
