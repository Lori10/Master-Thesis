  "formatted_prompt": "Q: On a certain transatlantic crossing, 40 percent of a ship\u2019s passengers held round-trip tickets and also took their cars abroad the ship. If 50 percent of the passengers with round-trip tickets did not take their cars abroad the ship, what percent of the ship\u2019s passengers held round-trip tickets? Answer Choices: (A) 40% (B) 50% (C) 60% (D) 80% (E) 90%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that there are 100 passengers on the ship. 40% of the passengers held round-trip tickets and took their cars abroad the ship, which means there are 40 passengers who fit this description. Now, we know that 50% of the passengers with round-trip tickets did not take their cars abroad the ship. So, out of the 40 passengers with round-trip tickets, 50% did not take their cars, which means 20 passengers did not take their cars. Therefore, the remaining 20 passengers with round-trip tickets did take their cars abroad the ship. To find the percentage of passengers with round-trip tickets, we divide the total number of passengers (100) into the number of passengers with round-trip tickets (40). 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%. So, the answer is (A) 40%. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A part-time employee whose hourly wage was decreased by 20 percent decided to increase the number of hours worked per week so that the employee's total income did not change. By what percent E should the number of hours worked be increased? Answer Choices: (A) 12.5% (B) 20% (C) 25% (D) 50% (E) 100%\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that the employee originally worked for x hours per week and earned y dollars per week. After the wage decrease of 20%, the employee's new hourly wage is 0.8y/x dollars per hour. To maintain the same total income, the employee needs to work for more hours. Let's call the new number of hours worked per week E. The employee's new weekly income is (0.8y/x) * E dollars. We want to find the percentage increase in the number of hours worked, which is given by: (E - x)/x * 100% Setting the new weekly income equal to the original weekly income, we get: (0.8y/x) * E = y Solving for E, we get: E = 1.25x Therefore, the percentage increase in the number of hours worked is: (E - x)/x * 100% = (1.25x - x)/x * 100% = 0.25 * 100% = 25% So the answer is (C) 25%. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In a class, 30% of the students speaks truth, 20% speaks lie and 10% speaks both. If a student is selected at random, what is the probability that he has speak truth or lie? Answer Choices: (A) 1/4 (B) 2/3 (C) 3/5 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the percentage of students who speak either truth or lie. Percentage of students who speak truth = 30% Percentage of students who speak lie = 20% However, we need to subtract the percentage of students who speak both truth and lie, as they have been counted twice. Percentage of students who speak both truth and lie = 10% Therefore, the percentage of students who speak either truth or lie = 30% + 20% - 10% = 40%. So, the probability that a student selected at random speaks truth or lie is 40%. Answer: None of the above (as none of the answer choices match 40%). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: In a recent survey 40% houses contained two or more people. Of those houses containing only one person 25% were having only a male. What is the percentage of all houses which contain exactly one female and no males? Answer Choices: (A) 75 (B) 40 (C) 15 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 40% of houses contain two or more people. This means that 60% of houses contain only one person. Of those houses containing only one person, 25% were having only a male. This means that 75% of houses containing only one person were either female-only or had both male and female occupants. We want to find the percentage of all houses which contain exactly one female and no males. We know that 75% of houses containing only one person were either female-only or had both male and female occupants. Therefore, the percentage of houses containing exactly one female and no males is the remaining percentage of houses containing only one person, which is: 100% - 75% = 25% Therefore, the answer is not listed in the answer choices. The correct answer is: (E) None of these The answer is E.\n\n\n"
