  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Rahim bought 65 books for Rs.1150 from one shop and 50 books for Rs.920 from another. What is the average price he paid per book ? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 18 (C) 99 (D) 787 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total cost of all the books Rahim bought. Total cost = Rs.1150 + Rs.920 = Rs.2070 Next, we need to find the total number of books Rahim bought. Total number of books = 65 + 50 = 115 Finally, we can find the average price per book by dividing the total cost by the total number of books. Average price per book = Total cost / Total number of books Average price per book = Rs.2070 / 115 Average price per book = Rs.18 Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 18. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 25 copies per minute. A second copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 55 copies per minute. Working together at their respective rates, how many copies do the two machines make in half an hour ? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 2,400 (C) 4,500 (D) 5,400 (E) 324,000\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the combined rate of the two machines. To do this, we add their individual rates: 25 copies/minute + 55 copies/minute = 80 copies/minute Next, we need to convert half an hour to minutes: 30 minutes Now we can use the formula: rate x time = amount Plugging in the values we have: 80 copies/minute x 30 minutes = 2400 copies Therefore, the answer is (B) 2,400. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A woman sold 300 oranges at $12.10, some at the rate of 3 for 35 cents and the rest at 7 for 85 cents. How many were sold at the first rate? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 21 (C) 9 (D) 15 (E) 13\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. Let the number of oranges sold at the rate of 3 for 35 cents be x. Then, the number of oranges sold at the rate of 7 for 85 cents would be 300 - x. The total amount earned from selling x oranges at the rate of 3 for 35 cents would be (x/3) * 0.35 dollars. Similarly, the total amount earned from selling (300 - x) oranges at the rate of 7 for 85 cents would be (7/85) * (300 - x) dollars. The total amount earned from selling all 300 oranges would be $12.10. So, we can write the equation: (x/3) * 0.35 + (7/85) * (300 - x) = 12.10 Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 45 Therefore, the number of oranges sold at the rate of 3 for 35 cents is 45. Hence, the answer is (A) 45. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Curious Elva asked her father what he would gift for her nineteenth birthday.
