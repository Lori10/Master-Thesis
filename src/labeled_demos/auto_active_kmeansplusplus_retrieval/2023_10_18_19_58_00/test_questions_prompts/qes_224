  "formatted_prompt": "Q: How many 4-digit Q numbers (ABCD) can be formed such that |A \u2013 D| = 2? Answer Choices: (A) 2,000 (B) 1,900 (C) 1,800 (D) 1,600 (E) 1,500\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that |A \u2013 D| = 2. This means that A and D are either 2 digits apart or 2 digits away from each other in the number line. Case 1: A is 2 digits greater than D. In this case, we can choose any digit from 1 to 9 for D (since it's a 4-digit number, we can't have 0 as the first digit). Then, A can be any digit that is 2 greater than D, except for 9 (since we can't have a 5th digit). So, there are 8 choices for A. Case 2: D is 2 digits greater than A. This is the same as Case 1, but with A and D switched. So, there are also 8 choices for A in this case. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit Q numbers that can be formed is 8 + 8 = 16. The answer is (D) 1,600. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: In a certain province in France there are 11 cities. If a single road segment connects only two cities, how many road segments are required in order to connect the cities so that each city is connected to all other cities with a single road segment? Answer Choices: (A) 55 (B) 105 (C) 330 (D) 143 (E) 156\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. There are 11 cities in the province. We need to connect each city to all other cities with a single road segment. Let's start with one city. It needs to be connected to 10 other cities. Moving on to the next city, it also needs to be connected to 10 other cities. But we have already connected it to one city, so it needs to be connected to 9 more cities. Similarly, for the third city, it needs to be connected to 8 more cities. We can continue this pattern until we reach the last city, which needs to be connected to only one more city. So, the total number of road segments required would be: 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 55 Therefore, the answer is (A) 55. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Two trains of equal lengths take 10 sec and 15 sec respectively to cross a telegraph post. If the length of each train be 120 m, in what time will they cross other travelling in opposite direction? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 12 (C) 13 (D) 14 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. The total distance covered by both trains when they cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is 240 meters. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds, since they are travelling in opposite directions. Let's call this speed \"v\". We know that the first train takes 10 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/10 = 12 m/s. Similarly, the second train takes 15 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/15 = 8 m/s. Therefore, the relative speed of the two trains is v = 12 + 8 = 20 m/s. To find the time it takes for the two trains to cross each other, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed Plugging in the values we know, we get: time = 240 / 20 = 12 seconds Therefore, the answer is (B) 12. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: What would happen in the previous question if both A and B had started at point P. Answer Choices: (A) 800 Km (B) 600 Km (C) 1000 Km (D) 350 Km (E) 250 Km\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that A travels at a speed of 50 km/h and B travels at a speed of 40 km/h. If they both started at point P, they would be moving in opposite directions. Let's say they meet after x hours. In that time, A would have traveled 50x km and B would have traveled 40x km. We also know that the distance between A and B is 600 km. So, we can set up the equation: 50x + 40x = 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 90x = 600 x = 6.67 hours Now that we know they meet after 6.67 hours, we can find out how far each of them has traveled: A: 50 km/h x 6.67 h = 333.33 km B: 40 km/h x 6.67 h = 266.67 km The total distance they have traveled is: 333.33 km + 266.67 km = 600 km Therefore, the answer is (B) 600 km. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
