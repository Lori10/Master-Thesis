  "formatted_prompt": "Q: How many 4-digit Q numbers (ABCD) can be formed such that |A \u2013 D| = 2? Answer Choices: (A) 2,000 (B) 1,900 (C) 1,800 (D) 1,600 (E) 1,500\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that |A \u2013 D| = 2. This means that A and D are either 2 digits apart or 2 digits away from each other in the number line. Case 1: A is 2 digits greater than D. In this case, we can choose any digit from 1 to 9 for D (since it's a 4-digit number, we can't have 0 as the first digit). Then, A can be any digit that is 2 greater than D, except for 9 (since we can't have a 5th digit). So, there are 8 choices for A. Case 2: D is 2 digits greater than A. This is the same as Case 1, but with A and D switched. So, there are also 8 choices for A in this case. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit Q numbers that can be formed is 8 + 8 = 16. The answer is (D) 1,600. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: How many keystrokes are needed to type numbers from 1 to 1000? Answer Choices: (A) 3001 (B) 2893 (C) 2704 (D) 2890 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. To type numbers from 1 to 9, we need 9 keystrokes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). To type numbers from 10 to 99, we need 180 keystrokes (10-19: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19; 20-29: 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29; and so on up to 90-99). To type numbers from 100 to 999, we need 2700 keystrokes (100-199: 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109; 110-119: 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119; and so on up to 990-999). Finally, we need 1 keystroke for the number 1000. Adding these up, we get 9 + 180 + 2700 + 1 = 2890 keystrokes. Therefore, the answer is (D) 2890. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: The operation is defined for all integers a and b by the equation ab = (a - 1)(b - 1). If x20 = 190, what is the value of x ? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 12 (C) 11 (D) 13 (E) 14\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that x20 = (x-1)(20-1) = (x-1)(19) = 190. To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 19: (x-1)(19)/19 = 190/19 Simplifying, we get: x-1 = 10 Adding 1 to both sides: x = 11 Therefore, the answer is (C) 11. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If y is the smallest positive integer such that 6300 multiplied by y is the square of an integer, then y must be Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 7 (C) 15 (D) 35 (E) 45\nA: Let's think step by step. We need to find the smallest positive integer y such that 6300 multiplied by y is the square of an integer. Let's factor 6300: 6300 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2 * 7 To be a perfect square, each prime factor must have an even exponent. Therefore, we need to add one factor of 7 to make the exponent of 7 even. So, y = 7. Therefore, the answer is (B) 7. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
