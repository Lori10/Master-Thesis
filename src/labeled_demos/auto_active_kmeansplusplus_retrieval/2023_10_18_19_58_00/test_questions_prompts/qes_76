  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A work which could be finished in 10 days was finished 3 days earlier after 10 more men joined. The number of men employed was? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 20 (C) 88 (D) 71 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the number of men initially employed be x. Then, the work done in 1 day by x men is 1/10 and the work done in 1 day by (x+10) men is 1/(10-3) = 1/7 (since the work was finished 3 days earlier). Now, we can set up an equation based on the work done by x men and (x+10) men: x/10 + (x+10)/7 = 1 Multiplying both sides by 70 (the least common multiple of 10 and 7) gives: 7x + 10(x+10) = 70 Simplifying and solving for x gives: 17x = 60 x = 60/17 Since x is not a whole number, none of the answer choices are correct. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: Pat, kate and mark charged a total of 198 hours to a certain project . If pat charged twice as much time to the project as kate and 1/3 as much times as mark, how many more hours did mark charge to the project than kate. Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 36 (C) 72 (D) 110 (E) 108\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that Kate charged x hours to the project. According to the problem, Pat charged twice as much time as Kate, so Pat charged 2x hours. Also, Pat charged 1/3 as much time as Mark, so Mark charged 3 times as much time as Pat, which is 6x hours. Therefore, the total time charged by all three is x + 2x + 6x = 9x. We know that the total time charged is 198 hours, so: 9x = 198 x = 22 So, Kate charged 22 hours, Pat charged 44 hours, and Mark charged 132 hours. The question asks how many more hours Mark charged than Kate, which is: 132 - 22 = 110 Therefore, the answer is (D) 110. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 25 copies per minute. A second copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 55 copies per minute. Working together at their respective rates, how many copies do the two machines make in half an hour ? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 2,400 (C) 4,500 (D) 5,400 (E) 324,000\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the combined rate of the two machines. To do this, we add their individual rates: 25 copies/minute + 55 copies/minute = 80 copies/minute Next, we need to convert half an hour to minutes: 30 minutes Now we can use the formula: rate x time = amount Plugging in the values we have: 80 copies/minute x 30 minutes = 2400 copies Therefore, the answer is (B) 2,400. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: James took a 3-hour bike ride. In the second hour he travlled 18 miles, which was 20 percent farther than he traveled the first hour. If he traveled 25 percent farther in the third hour than he did in the second hour, how many miles did jose travel during the entire ride? Answer Choices: (A) 54.0 (B) 54.9 (C) 55.5 (D) 57.0 (E) 63.0\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how far James traveled in the first hour. We know that in the second hour he traveled 20% farther than in the first hour, so we can set up the equation: 18 = 1.2x where x is the distance James traveled in the first hour. Solving for x, we get: x = 15 Next, we need to find out how far James traveled in the third hour. We know that in the third hour he traveled 25% farther than in the second hour, so we can set up the equation: d = 1.25(18) where d is the distance James traveled in the third hour. Solving for d, we get: d = 22.5 Finally, we can add up the distances traveled in each hour to find the total distance traveled: total distance = 15 + 18 + 22.5 = 55.5 Therefore, the answer is (C) 55.5. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
