  "formatted_prompt": "Q: you need to pict any number from 1, 3,5,7,9,11,13 and 15 to make below equation true.\n()+()+()=30\ncan you solve it? Answer Choices: (A) 7+15+9 (B) 6+15+9 (C) 6+14+9 (D) 6+15+8 (E) 8+15+9\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find three odd numbers that add up to 30. The sum of three odd numbers is always an odd number. Therefore, we can eliminate options (B) and (D) since they have an even number in them. Next, we can eliminate option (C) since the sum of 6, 14, and 9 is 29, not 30. Now, we are left with options (A) and (E). We can check both options to see which one adds up to 30. Option (A): 7 + 15 + 9 = 31, not 30. Option (E): 8 + 15 + 9 = 32, not 30. Therefore, none of the given options are correct. The answer is \"None of the above\". The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A numberais squared and then multiplied by negative 3. The result of this operation T is equal to three times the sum of three timesaand two. What is one possible value ofa? Answer Choices: (A) -3 (B) -2 (C) 1 (D) 2 (E) 3\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's translate the given information into an equation. a^2 * (-3) = 3(3a + 2) Simplifying the right side of the equation: a^2 * (-3) = 9a + 6 Multiplying both sides by -1 to get rid of the negative coefficient: a^2 * 3 = -9a - 6 Bringing all terms to one side: a^2 * 3 + 9a + 6 = 0 Now we can solve for a using the quadratic formula: a = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a a = (-9 \u00b1 sqrt(9^2 - 4(3)(6))) / 2(3) a = (-9 \u00b1 sqrt(57)) / 6 a \u2248 -2.07 or a \u2248 -1.26 Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: Angles AMB and CMD are right angles, \u2220AMD is acute, and \u2220BMC=y\u00b0 is acute. What is \u2220AMD ? Answer Choices: (A) 90\u00b0\u2212y (B) 180\u00b0\u2212y (C) 90\u00b0+y (D) 2y (E) y\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that angles AMB and CMD are right angles, which means they are both equal to 90 degrees. We also know that angle BMC is acute, which means it is less than 90 degrees. Since angles AMB and CMD are both right angles, they add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, angle AMD must be acute since it is less than 180 degrees. Now, let's use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. In triangle AMD, we have angles AMD, AMB, and CMD. AMD + AMB + CMD = 180 Substituting in the values we know: AMD + 90 + 90 = 180 Simplifying: AMD + 180 = 180 AMD = 0 This doesn't make sense since we know that angle AMD is acute. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: Let f(x) = x^2 + bx + c. If f(6) = 0 and f(-2) = 0, then b + c = Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 15 (C) -16 (D) -21 (E) -24\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that f(6) = 0 and f(-2) = 0. This means that when x = 6 and x = -2, the function f(x) equals zero. Using this information, we can set up two equations: (1) 6^2 + 6b + c = 0 (2) (-2)^2 - 2b + c = 0 Simplifying these equations: (1) 36 + 6b + c = 0 (2) 4 - 2b + c = 0 Now we can solve for b + c by adding the two equations together: 40 + 4b = 0 b = -10 Substituting b = -10 into either of the two equations above, we can solve for c: 36 + 6(-10) + c = 0 c = -6 Therefore, b + c = -10 - 6 = -16 The correct answer is (C) -16. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
