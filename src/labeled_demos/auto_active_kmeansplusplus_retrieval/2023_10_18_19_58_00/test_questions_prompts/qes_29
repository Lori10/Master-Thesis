  "test_question": "Q: The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3. What is its length now? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 30 (C) 6 (D) 15 (E) 12",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The greatest possible length which can be used to measure exactly the length 8m ,2m 15cm, 8m 90 cm is? Answer Choices: (A) 25cm (B) 101cm (C) 56cm (D) 42cm (E) 5cm\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the given lengths. 8m = 800cm 2m 15cm = 215cm 8m 90cm = 890cm Now, we need to find the GCF of 800, 215, and 890. The prime factorization of 800 is 2^5 x 5^2. The prime factorization of 215 is 5 x 43. The prime factorization of 890 is 2 x 5 x 89. The GCF of these three numbers is 5, since it is the only factor they have in common. Therefore, the greatest possible length that can be used to measure exactly 8m, 2m 15cm, and 8m 90cm is 5cm. The answer is (E) 5cm. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: The area of a square is 4225 sq cm. Find the ratio of the breadth and the length of a rectangle whose length is twice the side of the square and breadth is 24 cm less than the side of the square. Answer Choices: (A) 5:28 (B) 5:19 (C) 5:12 (D) 5:13 (E) 41:130\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the side of the square. We know that the area of the square is 4225 sq cm, so we can find the side by taking the square root of the area: Side of square = \u221a4225 = 65 cm Next, we need to find the length and breadth of the rectangle. We are given that the length is twice the side of the square, so: Length of rectangle = 2 x 65 = 130 cm We are also given that the breadth is 24 cm less than the side of the square, so: Breadth of rectangle = 65 - 24 = 41 cm Now, we need to find the ratio of the breadth and the length of the rectangle. Ratio of breadth to length = 41:130 Simplifying this ratio by dividing both sides by 41, we get: 1:3.17 Multiplying both sides by 5 to get rid of the decimal, we get: 5:15.83 Rounding off to the nearest whole number, we get: 5:16 Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A man cycles round the boundary of a rectangular park at the rate of 12 kmph and completes one full round in 8 minutes. If the ratio between the length and breadth of the park be 3:2, then its area is: Answer Choices: (A) 1536m2 (B) 15360m2 (C) 153600m2 (D) 163600m2 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular park. Let the length and breadth of the park be 3x and 2x respectively (as given in the ratio 3:2). Perimeter of the park = 2(Length + Breadth) = 2(3x + 2x) = 10x Now, we know that the man cycles round the park at the rate of 12 kmph. In 1 hour, he covers a distance of 12 km. In 1 minute, he covers a distance of 12/60 = 0.2 km = 200 m. In 8 minutes, he covers a distance of 200 x 8 = 1600 m = 1.6 km. We also know that in 8 minutes, he completes one full round of the park. Therefore, 10x = 1.6 km x = 160 m Length of the park = 3x = 480 m Breadth of the park = 2x = 320 m Area of the park = Length x Breadth = 480 x 320 = 153600 m\u00b2 Hence, the correct answer is (C) 153600m\u00b2. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A dog takes 3 leaps for every 7 leaps of a hare. If one leap of the dog is equal to 3 leaps of the hare, the ratio of the speed of the dog to that of the hare is : Answer Choices: (A) 9:7 (B) 9:9 (C) 9:6 (D) 9:1 (E) 9:2\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the ratio of the distance covered by the dog to that covered by the hare in one leap. Since one leap of the dog is equal to 3 leaps of the hare, the distance covered by the dog in one leap is 3 times the distance covered by the hare in one leap. Let's assume that the distance covered by the hare in one leap is x. Then, the distance covered by the dog in one leap is 3x. Now, we know that the dog takes 3 leaps for every 7 leaps of the hare. This means that in the same amount of time, the dog covers 3 times the distance covered by the hare. Therefore, the ratio of the speed of the dog to that of the hare is: 3x * 3 : x * 7 9x : 7x 9:7 So, the correct answer is (A) 9:7. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
