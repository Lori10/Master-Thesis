  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The total cars in a Garage is 1000 out of which 500 are made by Honda. Out of every 100 Honda cars, 90 are red in color, but only 50% of the total cars is red. Find the % of non-Honda cars that are red Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 20% (C) 30% (D) 25% (E) 15%\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of red cars. If 50% of the total cars are red, then the number of red cars is 50% of 1000, which is 500. Step 2: Find the number of red Honda cars. Out of every 100 Honda cars, 90 are red. So, out of 500 Honda cars, 90% are red, which is 450. Step 3: Find the number of non-Honda cars. The total number of cars is 1000, and 500 of them are Honda cars. So, the number of non-Honda cars is 1000 - 500, which is 500. Step 4: Find the number of non-Honda red cars. We know that there are 500 red cars in total, and 450 of them are red Honda cars. So, the number of non-Honda red cars is 500 - 450, which is 50. Step 5: Find the percentage of non-Honda red cars. Out of 500 non-Honda cars, 50 are red. So, the percentage of non-Honda red cars is (50/500) x 100, which is 10%. Therefore, the answer is (A) 10%. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: In the parking lot there are 44 vehicles, 24 of them are buses, and the rest are cars. The color of 24 vehicles is red, of which 18 are buses. How many cars can be found in the parking lot which are not colored red? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 12 (C) 13 (D) 14 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that there are 44 vehicles in total, out of which 24 are buses. Therefore, the number of cars in the parking lot is: 44 - 24 = 20 Step 2: We also know that the color of 24 vehicles is red, out of which 18 are buses. Therefore, the number of cars that are colored red is: 24 - 18 = 6 Step 3: We need to find the number of cars that are not colored red. We know that there are 20 cars in total, out of which 6 are colored red. Therefore, the number of cars that are not colored red is: 20 - 6 = 14 Therefore, the answer is (D) 14. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: On a certain transatlantic crossing, 40 percent of a ship\u2019s passengers held round-trip tickets and also took their cars abroad the ship. If 50 percent of the passengers with round-trip tickets did not take their cars abroad the ship, what percent of the ship\u2019s passengers held round-trip tickets? Answer Choices: (A) 40% (B) 50% (C) 60% (D) 80% (E) 90%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that there are 100 passengers on the ship. 40% of the passengers held round-trip tickets and took their cars abroad the ship, which means there are 40 passengers who fit this description. Now, we know that 50% of the passengers with round-trip tickets did not take their cars abroad the ship. So, out of the 40 passengers with round-trip tickets, 50% did not take their cars, which means 20 passengers did not take their cars. Therefore, the remaining 20 passengers with round-trip tickets did take their cars abroad the ship. To find the percentage of passengers with round-trip tickets, we divide the total number of passengers (100) into the number of passengers with round-trip tickets (40). 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%. So, the answer is (A) 40%. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: In a recent survey 40% houses contained two or more people. Of those houses containing only one person 25% were having only a male. What is the percentage of all houses which contain exactly one female and no males? Answer Choices: (A) 75 (B) 40 (C) 15 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 40% of houses contain two or more people. This means that 60% of houses contain only one person. Of those houses containing only one person, 25% were having only a male. This means that 75% of houses containing only one person were either female-only or had both male and female occupants. We want to find the percentage of all houses which contain exactly one female and no males. We know that 75% of houses containing only one person were either female-only or had both male and female occupants. Therefore, the percentage of houses containing exactly one female and no males is the remaining percentage of houses containing only one person, which is: 100% - 75% = 25% Therefore, the answer is not listed in the answer choices. The correct answer is: (E) None of these The answer is E.\n\n\n"
