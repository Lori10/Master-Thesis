  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Rose is two years older than Bruce who is twice as old as Chris. If the total of the age of Rose, B and Chris be 47 years, then how old is Bruce ? Answer Choices: (A) 18 years (B) 10 years (C) 12 years (D) 13 years (E) 14 years\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's start by assigning variables to the ages of Bruce and Chris. Let's say Bruce's age is B and Chris's age is C. According to the problem, Rose is two years older than Bruce, so her age can be represented as B + 2. We also know that Bruce is twice as old as Chris, so we can write: B = 2C Now we can substitute B = 2C into the equation for the total of their ages: (B + 2) + B + C = 47 Simplifying this equation: 2B + C = 45 Substituting B = 2C: 4C + C = 45 5C = 45 C = 9 Now we can find Bruce's age: B = 2C = 2(9) = 18 So the answer is (A) 18 years. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A father said to his son, \"I was as old as you are at the present at the time of your birth\". If the father's age is 38 years now, the son's age five years back was: Answer Choices: (A) 24 years (B) 33 years (C) 14 years (D) 18 years (E) 9 years\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the son's current age be x. According to the problem, the father's age at the time of the son's birth was x. Therefore, the father's current age is x + 38 (since the son's current age is x). We need to find the son's age 5 years back, which would be x - 5. Now, we can set up an equation: x - 5 = 38 - x Solving for x, we get: 2x = 43 x = 21.5 Therefore, the son's age 5 years back was: 21.5 - 5 = 16.5 None of the answer choices match this result, so the answer is: None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Ayush was born two years after his father's marriage. His mother is five years younger than his father but 22 years older than Ayush who is 10 years old. At what age did the father get married ? Answer Choices: (A) 22years (B) 23years (C) 24years (D) 25years (E) 26years\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the father got married at age x. According to the problem, Ayush is currently 10 years old. Therefore, his father's age would be (x + 10) years old. We also know that Ayush's mother is 5 years younger than his father. Therefore, her age would be (x + 10 - 5) = (x + 5) years old. Finally, we know that Ayush's mother is 22 years older than Ayush. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 5 = 10 + 22 Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 27 Therefore, the father got married at age 27 - 2 = 25 years old. The correct answer is (D) 25 years. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: At a contest with 2,500 participants, 1/2 of the people are aged 10 to 12. Next year, the number of people aged 10 to 12 will increase by 1/5. After this change, what percentage of the total 2,500 people will the 10- to 12-year-olds represent? Answer Choices: (A) 55% (B) 60% (C) 50% (D) 45% (E) 66%\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 at the contest. 1/2 of 2,500 = 1,250 people aged 10 to 12. Step 2: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1/5 of 1,250 = 250 people increase. 1,250 + 250 = 1,500 people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. Step 3: Find the percentage of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1,500/2,500 x 100% = 60% Therefore, the answer is (B) 60%. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
