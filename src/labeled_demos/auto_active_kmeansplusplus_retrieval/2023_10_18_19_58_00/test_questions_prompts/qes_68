  "test_question": "Q: In a survey of students, each student selected from a list of 10 songs the 2 songs that the student liked best. If each song was selected 5 times, how many students were surveyed? Answer Choices: (A) 96 (B) 48 (C) 32 (D) 25 (E) 18",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Bill\u2019s compact disc player randomly plays a song, so that no song is repeated before the entire album is played. If Bill plays a disc with 12 songs, what are the chances that the third song he hears will be his favorite? Answer Choices: (A) 1/12 (B) 1/13 (C) 1/11 (D) 3/14 (E) 1/3\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 12 songs on the disc, so the probability of any one song being played third is 1/12. However, we are looking for the probability that Bill's favorite song is played third. Since the songs are played randomly, there are 12 possible songs that could be played first, 11 possible songs that could be played second (since one song has already been played), and 10 possible songs that could be played third (since two songs have already been played). Therefore, the probability of Bill's favorite song being played third is: 1/12 (probability of it being the third song) x 1/11 (probability of it being one of the remaining songs on the second play) x 1/10 (probability of it being one of the remaining songs on the third play) = 1/132 So the answer is (B) 1/13. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In the third grade of Windblown School there are 96 students, one third of them failed the math test and 1/6 failed that literature test. At least how many students failed both tests? Answer Choices: (A) 0. (B) 6. (C) 8. (D) 10. (E) 12.\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of students who failed the math test. One third of the 96 students failed the math test, so: 1/3 x 96 = 32 Therefore, 32 students failed the math test. Step 2: Find the number of students who failed the literature test. 1/6 of the 96 students failed the literature test, so: 1/6 x 96 = 16 Therefore, 16 students failed the literature test. Step 3: Find the number of students who failed both tests. We don't know the exact number of students who failed both tests, but we do know that it must be less than or equal to the smaller of the two numbers we just found (i.e. 16). Therefore, the answer is (B) 6, because that is the only option that is less than or equal to 16. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: We have 4 people and 1 chairs. In how many ways chairs can be occupy? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 86 (C) 24 (D) 14 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. If we have 4 people and only 1 chair, then only one person can sit on the chair at a time. So, we need to find the number of ways in which we can choose one person out of 4 to sit on the chair. The number of ways to choose one person out of 4 is 4. Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. None of the other options are correct as they are either too high or too low for the given scenario. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In a class, 30% of the students speaks truth, 20% speaks lie and 10% speaks both. If a student is selected at random, what is the probability that he has speak truth or lie? Answer Choices: (A) 1/4 (B) 2/3 (C) 3/5 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the percentage of students who speak either truth or lie. Percentage of students who speak truth = 30% Percentage of students who speak lie = 20% However, we need to subtract the percentage of students who speak both truth and lie, as they have been counted twice. Percentage of students who speak both truth and lie = 10% Therefore, the percentage of students who speak either truth or lie = 30% + 20% - 10% = 40%. So, the probability that a student selected at random speaks truth or lie is 40%. Answer: None of the above (as none of the answer choices match 40%). The answer is A.\n\n\n"
