  "test_question": "Q: What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729. Answer Choices: (A) 37 (B) 38 (C) 36 (D) 30 (E) 39",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: How Many 7\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are there in the following sequence which are immediately preceded by 6 but not immediately followed by 4?\n6 7 4 2 7 4 9 3 6 7 1 9 4 7 2 9 6 7 1 3 6 7 4 3 6 Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Identify all the 7's in the sequence: 6 7 4 2 7 4 9 3 6 7 1 9 4 7 2 9 6 7 1 3 6 7 4 3 6 Step 2: Check if each 7 is immediately preceded by 6 and not immediately followed by 4. Step 3: We find that there are only two 7's that meet this condition: 6 7 1 3 6 and 6 7 4 3 6. Therefore, the answer is (B) 2. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: you need to pict any number from 1, 3,5,7,9,11,13 and 15 to make below equation true.\n()+()+()=30\ncan you solve it? Answer Choices: (A) 7+15+9 (B) 6+15+9 (C) 6+14+9 (D) 6+15+8 (E) 8+15+9\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find three odd numbers that add up to 30. The sum of three odd numbers is always an odd number. Therefore, we can eliminate options (B) and (D) since they have an even number in them. Next, we can eliminate option (C) since the sum of 6, 14, and 9 is 29, not 30. Now, we are left with options (A) and (E). We can check both options to see which one adds up to 30. Option (A): 7 + 15 + 9 = 31, not 30. Option (E): 8 + 15 + 9 = 32, not 30. Therefore, none of the given options are correct. The answer is \"None of the above\". The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Find the odd man out. 187, 264, 316, 473, 682, 781 Answer Choices: (A) 187 (B) 316 (C) 781 (D) 682 (E) 473\nA: Let's think step by step. The numbers seem random, so we need to find a pattern or rule that applies to all except one of the numbers. If we look at the last digit of each number, we can see that they alternate between odd and even: 7, 4, 6, 3, 2, 1. However, this pattern doesn't apply to 316, which ends in an even digit. Therefore, the odd man out is (B) 316. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Find the invalid no.from the following series 10, 17, 22, 29, 34, 36 Answer Choices: (A) 36 (B) 18 (C) 40 (D) 37 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. The given series is 10, 17, 22, 29, 34, 36. To find the invalid number, we need to identify the pattern in the series. The pattern is that each number is obtained by adding 5 or 7 to the previous number. 10 + 7 = 17 17 + 5 = 22 22 + 7 = 29 29 + 5 = 34 34 + 2 = 36 The invalid number is 36 because it is not obtained by adding 5 or 7 to the previous number. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 36. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
