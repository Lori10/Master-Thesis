  "test_question": "Q: X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ? Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In what ratio mental A at Rs.68 per kg be mixed with another metal at Rs.96 per kg so that cost of alloy (mixture) is Rs.72 per kg? Answer Choices: (A) 6:1 (B) 4:7 (C) 3:7 (D) 9:5 (E) 9:8\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the ratio of mental A to the other metal be x:y. Then, the cost of 1 kg of the alloy is given by: (68x + 96y)/(x+y) = 72 Multiplying both sides by (x+y), we get: 68x + 96y = 72(x+y) Expanding and simplifying, we get: 4x = 3y So, the ratio of mental A to the other metal is 4:3. However, this is not one of the answer choices. We can try simplifying the ratio further by dividing both sides by 3: 4/3 : 1 Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: 4 : 3 So, the ratio of mental A to the other metal is 4:3, which is equivalent to option (None of the above). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Solution A is 10% salt and Solution B is 80% salt. If you have 30 ounces of solution A and 60 ounces of solution B, in what ratio could you mix Solution A with Solution B to produce 50 ounces of a 50% salt solution? Answer Choices: (A) 6:4 (B) 6:14 (C) 3:4 (D) 4:6 (E) 3:7\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Calculate the amount of salt in Solution A and Solution B. - Solution A: 10% of 30 ounces = 3 ounces of salt - Solution B: 80% of 60 ounces = 48 ounces of salt Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the amount of salt in the final mixture. - Let x be the amount of Solution A needed to make 50 ounces of a 50% salt solution. - Then, (50 - x) is the amount of Solution B needed. - The equation is: 0.1x + 0.8(50 - x) = 0.5(50) Step 3: Solve for x. - 0.1x + 40 - 0.8x = 25 - -0.7x = -15 - x = 21.43 Step 4: Calculate the ratio of Solution A to Solution B. - Solution A: 21.43 ounces - Solution B: 50 - 21.43 = 28.57 ounces - Ratio of Solution A to Solution B = 21.43:28.57 = 3:4 Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 3:4. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A jar full of whisky contains 40% alcohol. A part of this whisky is replaced by another containg 19% alcohol and now the percentage of alcohol was found to be 22%. What quantity of whisky is replaced ? Answer Choices: (A) 1/3 (B) 2/3 (C) 2/5 (D) 3/5 (E) 4/5\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the jar initially contains 100 units of whisky. Out of these 100 units, 40 units are alcohol. Let's say x units of whisky are replaced with the new whisky containing 19% alcohol. So, the amount of alcohol in the new mixture will be: 40 - 0.4x (alcohol in the original mixture) + 0.19x (alcohol in the new mixture) The total amount of whisky in the new mixture will be: 100 - x (original amount) + x (new amount) Now, we are given that the percentage of alcohol in the new mixture is 22%. So, we can set up the equation: (40 - 0.4x + 0.19x)/(100) = 0.22 Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 2/5 Therefore, 2/5 of the original amount of whisky is replaced with the new whisky containing 19% alcohol. So, the answer is (C) 2/5. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: the ratio of water and milk is 2:3.after adding 4litre milk ratio become 1:2? calculate amount of water? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 8 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. Initially, let's assume that the amount of water in the mixture is 2x and the amount of milk is 3x. So, the total amount of the mixture is 2x + 3x = 5x. After adding 4 liters of milk, the total amount of the mixture becomes 5x + 4. Now, the ratio of water to milk is 1:2, which means the amount of water is x and the amount of milk is 2x. So, we can write the equation as: 2x + 4 = 2(2x) Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x + 4 = 4x 2x = 4 x = 2 Therefore, the amount of water in the mixture initially was 2x = 2(2) = 4 liters. So, the correct answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the calculated answer. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
