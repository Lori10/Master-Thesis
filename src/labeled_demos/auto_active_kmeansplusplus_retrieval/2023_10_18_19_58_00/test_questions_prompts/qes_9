  "test_question": "Q: What is the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 7 (C) 3 (D) 8 (E) 12",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If x^2 \u2013 13x + 40 = q, and x is a positive integer between 1 and 10, inclusive, what is the probability that q < 0? Answer Choices: (A) 1/5 (B) 1/10 (C) 2/5 (D) 3/5 (E) 3/10\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to factor the quadratic equation x^2 \u2013 13x + 40 to find its roots: x^2 \u2013 13x + 40 = (x \u2013 5)(x \u2013 8) Therefore, the equation can be rewritten as: (x \u2013 5)(x \u2013 8) = q To find when q < 0, we need to determine when the product (x \u2013 5)(x \u2013 8) is negative. This occurs when x is between 5 and 8, exclusive, because when x is less than 5 or greater than 8, at least one of the factors is negative, making the product positive. So, out of the 10 possible values of x (1 to 10), there are 2 values (6 and 7) that satisfy the condition q < 0. Therefore, the probability is 2/10 or 1/5. The answer is (A) 1/5. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: If k is an integer and 0.0010101 x 10^k is greater than 100, what is the least possible value of k? Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 4 (D) 5 (E) 6\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can simplify 0.0010101 x 10^k to 1.0101 x 10^(k-3) by moving the decimal point three places to the right. Next, we need to find the least possible value of k that makes 1.0101 x 10^(k-3) greater than 100. We can rewrite this inequality as: 1.0101 x 10^(k-3) > 100 Dividing both sides by 100: 0.010101 x 10^(k-3) > 1 Taking the logarithm of both sides: log(0.010101) + (k-3)log(10) > 0 Simplifying: -2.9957 + k > 0 k > 2.9957 The smallest integer value of k that satisfies this inequality is 3. Therefore, the answer is (B) 3. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: How many integer values W are there for x such that 1 < 3x + 5 < 17? Answer Choices: (A) Two (B) Three (C) Four (D) Five (E) Six\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to isolate x in the inequality. 1 < 3x + 5 < 17 Subtract 5 from all parts of the inequality: -4 < 3x < 12 Divide all parts of the inequality by 3: -4/3 < x < 4 Now we know that x must be between -4/3 and 4. To find the integer values of x that satisfy this inequality, we need to look at the integers between -1 and 3 (since -4/3 is not an integer and we are looking for integer values of x). The integers between -1 and 3 are: -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. Therefore, there are 5 integer values of x that satisfy the inequality. The answer is (D) Five. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A numberais squared and then multiplied by negative 3. The result of this operation T is equal to three times the sum of three timesaand two. What is one possible value ofa? Answer Choices: (A) -3 (B) -2 (C) 1 (D) 2 (E) 3\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's translate the given information into an equation. a^2 * (-3) = 3(3a + 2) Simplifying the right side of the equation: a^2 * (-3) = 9a + 6 Multiplying both sides by -1 to get rid of the negative coefficient: a^2 * 3 = -9a - 6 Bringing all terms to one side: a^2 * 3 + 9a + 6 = 0 Now we can solve for a using the quadratic formula: a = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a a = (-9 \u00b1 sqrt(9^2 - 4(3)(6))) / 2(3) a = (-9 \u00b1 sqrt(57)) / 6 a \u2248 -2.07 or a \u2248 -1.26 Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\n"
