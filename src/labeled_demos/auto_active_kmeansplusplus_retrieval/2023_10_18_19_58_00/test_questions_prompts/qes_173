  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A club with a total membership of 25 has formed 3 committees, M, S and R, which have 8, 12 and 5 members respectively. If no members of committee M is on either of the other 2 committees, what is the greatest possible number of members in the club who are on none of the committees? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 7 (C) 8 (D) 10 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of members who are on the committees. M has 8 members, S has 12 members, and R has 5 members. Since no members of M are on either of the other 2 committees, we can subtract the 8 members of M from the total number of committee members: Total committee members = 8 + 12 + 5 - 8 = 17 So, there are 17 members on the committees. To find the greatest possible number of members who are on none of the committees, we need to subtract this number from the total membership of the club: Greatest possible number of members not on committees = 25 - 17 = 8 Therefore, the answer is (C) 8. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Paul's income is 40% less than Rex's income, Quentin's income is 20% less than Paul's income, and Sam's income is 40% less than Paul's income. If Rex gave 40% of his income to Sam and 60% of his income to Quentin, Quentin's new income would be what fraction of Sam's new income? Answer Choices: (A) \t11/12 (B) \t13/17 (C) \t13/19 (D) \t12/19 (E) \t27/19\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume Rex's income to be 100. Then, Paul's income would be 60 (40% less than Rex's income). Quentin's income would be 48 (20% less than Paul's income). Sam's income would be 36 (40% less than Paul's income). If Rex gave 40% of his income to Sam, Sam's new income would be 76 (40% of 100 is 40, so Rex would have 60 left to give to Quentin and keep for himself). If Rex gave 60% of his income to Quentin, Quentin's new income would be 88 (60% of 100 is 60, so Quentin would have 48 from his original income and 60 from Rex's gift). So, Quentin's new income is 88/76 = 22/19 of Sam's new income. Therefore, the answer is (E) 27/19. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A firm has 3 senior partners and 6 junior partners. How many different groups of 3 partners can be formed in which at least one member of the group is a senior partner? (Note that two groups are considered different if at least one group member is different.) Answer Choices: (A) 64 (B) 68 (C) 72 (D) 76 (E) 80\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of ways to form a group of 3 partners from 9 partners (3 senior + 6 junior). This can be done using the combination formula: C(9,3) = 84 Step 2: Find the number of ways to form a group of 3 partners in which all members are junior partners. This can be done using the combination formula: C(6,3) = 20 Step 3: Find the number of ways to form a group of 3 partners in which no senior partner is included. This can be done by selecting 3 junior partners from the 6 available: C(6,3) = 20 Step 4: Subtract the number of groups in Step 2 and Step 3 from the total number of groups in Step 1 to get the number of groups in which at least one senior partner is included: 84 - 20 - 20 = 44 Therefore, the answer is (None of the above). The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A invested $300 in a business after 6 months B invested $200 in the business. End of the year if they got $100 as profit. Find A shares? Answer Choices: (A) $100 (B) $75 (C) $20 (D) $120 (E) $50\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total investment made by A and B. A invested $300 for 12 months, so his total investment is $300 * 12 = $3600. B invested $200 for 12 months, so his total investment is $200 * 12 = $2400. Next, we need to find the ratio of their investments. A invested $3600 and B invested $2400, so the ratio of their investments is 3600:2400, which simplifies to 3:2. Now, we need to find A's share of the profit. Since the ratio of their investments is 3:2, A's share of the profit is 3/5 of the total profit. Therefore, A's share of the profit is $100 * 3/5 = $60. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above, as none of the given answer choices match the calculated answer of $60. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
