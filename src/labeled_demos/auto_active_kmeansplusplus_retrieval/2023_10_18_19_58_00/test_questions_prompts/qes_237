  "formatted_prompt": "Q: James took a 3-hour bike ride. In the second hour he travlled 18 miles, which was 20 percent farther than he traveled the first hour. If he traveled 25 percent farther in the third hour than he did in the second hour, how many miles did jose travel during the entire ride? Answer Choices: (A) 54.0 (B) 54.9 (C) 55.5 (D) 57.0 (E) 63.0\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how far James traveled in the first hour. We know that in the second hour he traveled 20% farther than in the first hour, so we can set up the equation: 18 = 1.2x where x is the distance James traveled in the first hour. Solving for x, we get: x = 15 Next, we need to find out how far James traveled in the third hour. We know that in the third hour he traveled 25% farther than in the second hour, so we can set up the equation: d = 1.25(18) where d is the distance James traveled in the third hour. Solving for d, we get: d = 22.5 Finally, we can add up the distances traveled in each hour to find the total distance traveled: total distance = 15 + 18 + 22.5 = 55.5 Therefore, the answer is (C) 55.5. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: What would happen in the previous question if both A and B had started at point P. Answer Choices: (A) 800 Km (B) 600 Km (C) 1000 Km (D) 350 Km (E) 250 Km\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that A travels at a speed of 50 km/h and B travels at a speed of 40 km/h. If they both started at point P, they would be moving in opposite directions. Let's say they meet after x hours. In that time, A would have traveled 50x km and B would have traveled 40x km. We also know that the distance between A and B is 600 km. So, we can set up the equation: 50x + 40x = 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 90x = 600 x = 6.67 hours Now that we know they meet after 6.67 hours, we can find out how far each of them has traveled: A: 50 km/h x 6.67 h = 333.33 km B: 40 km/h x 6.67 h = 266.67 km The total distance they have traveled is: 333.33 km + 266.67 km = 600 km Therefore, the answer is (B) 600 km. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A car covers a distance of 624 km in 2 2/5 hours. Find its speed? Answer Choices: (A) 104 kmph (B) 194 kmph (C) 109 kmph (D) 260 kmph (E) 271 kmph\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that speed = distance/time. Here, the distance covered by the car is 624 km and the time taken is 2 2/5 hours. To convert the mixed fraction to an improper fraction, we can multiply the whole number (2) by the denominator (5) and add the numerator (2) to get 12/5. So, time taken = 12/5 hours. Now, we can substitute these values in the formula: Speed = distance/time Speed = 624/(12/5) Speed = 624 * 5/12 Speed = 260 kmph Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 260 kmph. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: The diameter of the driving wheel of a bus is 120 m. How many revolution, per minute must the wheel make in order to keep a speed of 60 kmph approximately Answer Choices: (A) 245 (B) 257 (C) 262 (D) 265 (E) 275\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed from km/h to m/min. 60 km/h = 60,000 m/h = 1,000 m/min Next, we need to find the circumference of the wheel using the formula: Circumference = \u03c0 \u00d7 diameter Circumference = \u03c0 \u00d7 120 m Circumference \u2248 376.99 m Finally, we can use the formula: Speed = circumference \u00d7 revolutions per minute 1,000 m/min = 376.99 m \u00d7 revolutions per minute Revolutions per minute \u2248 2.65 Therefore, the answer is (D) 265. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
