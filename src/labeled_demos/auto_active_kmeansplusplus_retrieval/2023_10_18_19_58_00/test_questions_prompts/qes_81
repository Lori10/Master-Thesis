  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In the formula V = 1/(2r)^2, if r is halved, then V is multiplied by Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 8 (C) 1 (D) 1/8 (E) 1/64\nA: Let's think step by step. The formula is V = 1/(2r)^2. If r is halved, then the new radius becomes r/2. Substituting this new value of r in the formula, we get: V = 1/(2(r/2))^2 V = 1/(r^2/2^2) V = 1/(r^2/4) V = 4/r^2 So, the new volume is 4/r^2 times the original volume. Therefore, if r is halved, V is multiplied by 4. The correct answer is (A) 2. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A circular mat with diameter 3.5 inches is placed on a square tabletop, each of whose sides is 6 inches long. Which of the following is closest to the fraction of the tabletop covered by the mat? Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 1 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) 5\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the area of the circular mat. The formula for the area of a circle is A = \u03c0r^2, where r is the radius. The diameter of the mat is 3.5 inches, so the radius is half of that, which is 1.75 inches. Therefore, the area of the mat is: A = \u03c0(1.75)^2 A \u2248 9.62 square inches Next, we need to find the area of the tabletop. The formula for the area of a square is A = s^2, where s is the length of a side. The sides of the tabletop are 6 inches long, so the area of the tabletop is: A = 6^2 A = 36 square inches To find the fraction of the tabletop covered by the mat, we need to divide the area of the mat by the area of the tabletop: 9.62 / 36 \u2248 0.267 This means that the mat covers approximately 26.7% of the tabletop. None of the answer choices given match this result, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The area of a square is 4225 sq cm. Find the ratio of the breadth and the length of a rectangle whose length is twice the side of the square and breadth is 24 cm less than the side of the square. Answer Choices: (A) 5:28 (B) 5:19 (C) 5:12 (D) 5:13 (E) 41:130\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the side of the square. We know that the area of the square is 4225 sq cm, so we can find the side by taking the square root of the area: Side of square = \u221a4225 = 65 cm Next, we need to find the length and breadth of the rectangle. We are given that the length is twice the side of the square, so: Length of rectangle = 2 x 65 = 130 cm We are also given that the breadth is 24 cm less than the side of the square, so: Breadth of rectangle = 65 - 24 = 41 cm Now, we need to find the ratio of the breadth and the length of the rectangle. Ratio of breadth to length = 41:130 Simplifying this ratio by dividing both sides by 41, we get: 1:3.17 Multiplying both sides by 5 to get rid of the decimal, we get: 5:15.83 Rounding off to the nearest whole number, we get: 5:16 Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Peter rolls two dice at the same time. What is the probability that the total sum of numbers on the dices is 3? Answer Choices: (A) a)  1/12 (B) b)  1/36 (C) c)  1/6 (D) d)  1/18 (E) e)  1/3\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice, as each die has 6 possible outcomes. To get a sum of 3, the only possible outcomes are (1,2) and (2,1). Therefore, there are only 2 favorable outcomes out of 36 possible outcomes. So, the probability of getting a sum of 3 is 2/36, which simplifies to 1/18. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) d) 1/18. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
