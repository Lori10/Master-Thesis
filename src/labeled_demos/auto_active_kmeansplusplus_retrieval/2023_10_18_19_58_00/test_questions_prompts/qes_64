  "test_question": "Q: A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure? Answer Choices: (A) 58.3% (B) 62.5% (C) 63.5% (D) 64.5% (E) 65.5%",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A part-time employee whose hourly wage was decreased by 20 percent decided to increase the number of hours worked per week so that the employee's total income did not change. By what percent E should the number of hours worked be increased? Answer Choices: (A) 12.5% (B) 20% (C) 25% (D) 50% (E) 100%\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that the employee originally worked for x hours per week and earned y dollars per week. After the wage decrease of 20%, the employee's new hourly wage is 0.8y/x dollars per hour. To maintain the same total income, the employee needs to work for more hours. Let's call the new number of hours worked per week E. The employee's new weekly income is (0.8y/x) * E dollars. We want to find the percentage increase in the number of hours worked, which is given by: (E - x)/x * 100% Setting the new weekly income equal to the original weekly income, we get: (0.8y/x) * E = y Solving for E, we get: E = 1.25x Therefore, the percentage increase in the number of hours worked is: (E - x)/x * 100% = (1.25x - x)/x * 100% = 0.25 * 100% = 25% So the answer is (C) 25%. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Paul's income is 40% less than Rex's income, Quentin's income is 20% less than Paul's income, and Sam's income is 40% less than Paul's income. If Rex gave 40% of his income to Sam and 60% of his income to Quentin, Quentin's new income would be what fraction of Sam's new income? Answer Choices: (A) \t11/12 (B) \t13/17 (C) \t13/19 (D) \t12/19 (E) \t27/19\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume Rex's income to be 100. Then, Paul's income would be 60 (40% less than Rex's income). Quentin's income would be 48 (20% less than Paul's income). Sam's income would be 36 (40% less than Paul's income). If Rex gave 40% of his income to Sam, Sam's new income would be 76 (40% of 100 is 40, so Rex would have 60 left to give to Quentin and keep for himself). If Rex gave 60% of his income to Quentin, Quentin's new income would be 88 (60% of 100 is 60, so Quentin would have 48 from his original income and 60 from Rex's gift). So, Quentin's new income is 88/76 = 22/19 of Sam's new income. Therefore, the answer is (E) 27/19. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: If the selling price is quadrupled,the profit is pentadruple, what is the percentage of profit?? Answer Choices: (A) 50% (B) 100% (C) 150% (D) 200% (E) 250%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the cost price of the item is $100. If the selling price is quadrupled, the new selling price would be $400. Let's say the profit made at the original selling price was $x. If the profit is pentadrupled, the new profit would be $5x. Profit = Selling price - Cost price So, x = Selling price - $100 $5x = $400 - $100 $5x = $300 x = $60 Therefore, the original profit was $60 and the new profit is $300. Percentage increase in profit = (New profit - Original profit) / Original profit * 100 = (300 - 60) / 60 * 100 = 400% So, the answer is (D) 200%. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: The no.of seats in a cinema hall is decreased by 5%, the price on the ticket also 5%. What is the effect on the revenue collected..?? Answer Choices: (A) -10% (B) +2.5% (C) -9.75% (D) +10.5% (E) +11.5%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the original number of seats in the cinema hall is 100 and the original price of a ticket is $10. After the decrease of 5%, the new number of seats will be 95 (100 - 5% of 100) and the new price of a ticket will be $9.50 (10 - 5% of 10). Therefore, the new revenue collected can be calculated as follows: New revenue = New number of seats x New price of a ticket New revenue = 95 x 9.50 New revenue = $902.50 Now, let's compare the new revenue with the original revenue: Original revenue = Original number of seats x Original price of a ticket Original revenue = 100 x 10 Original revenue = $1000 The percentage decrease in revenue can be calculated as follows: Percentage decrease = (Original revenue - New revenue) / Original revenue x 100% Percentage decrease = (1000 - 902.50) / 1000 x 100% Percentage decrease = 9.75% Therefore, the answer is (C) -9.75%. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
