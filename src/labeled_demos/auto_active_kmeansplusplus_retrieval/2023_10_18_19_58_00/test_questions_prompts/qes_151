  "test_question": "Q: If 10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number the result is equal to sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number. Find the number Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 160 (C) 150 (D) 210 (E) 220",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Seventy five percent of a number is 21 less than four fifth of that number. What is the number ? Answer Choices: (A) 240 (B) 340 (C) 420 (D) 130 (E) 125\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the number to be 'x'. According to the problem, 75% of the number is 21 less than 4/5 of the number. Translating this into an equation: 0.75x = (4/5)x - 21 Simplifying this equation: 0.75x - (4/5)x = -21 (15/20)x - (16/20)x = -21 (-1/20)x = -21 x = (-21) * (-20) x = 420 Therefore, the answer is (C) 420. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In a division sum, the divisor is ten times the quotient and five times the remainder. If the remainder is 38, the dividend is: Answer Choices: (A) 3648 (B) 3642 (C) 3636 (D) 3644 (E) 3864\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the quotient to be x. According to the problem, the divisor is ten times the quotient, which means the divisor is 10x. Also, the divisor is five times the remainder, which means the remainder is 10x/5 or 2x. Given that the remainder is 38, we can solve for x: 2x = 38 x = 19 Now that we know the quotient is 19, we can find the dividend by using the formula: Dividend = Divisor x Quotient + Remainder Dividend = 10x19 + 38 Dividend = 190 + 38 Dividend = 228 Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above, as none of the options match the calculated dividend of 228. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: In a class, 30% of the students speaks truth, 20% speaks lie and 10% speaks both. If a student is selected at random, what is the probability that he has speak truth or lie? Answer Choices: (A) 1/4 (B) 2/3 (C) 3/5 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the percentage of students who speak either truth or lie. Percentage of students who speak truth = 30% Percentage of students who speak lie = 20% However, we need to subtract the percentage of students who speak both truth and lie, as they have been counted twice. Percentage of students who speak both truth and lie = 10% Therefore, the percentage of students who speak either truth or lie = 30% + 20% - 10% = 40%. So, the probability that a student selected at random speaks truth or lie is 40%. Answer: None of the above (as none of the answer choices match 40%). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The difference between a positive proper fraction and its reciprocal is 9/20. The fraction is? Answer Choices: (A) 4/5 (B) 4/7 (C) 5 (D) 5/7 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the fraction be x/y. According to the problem, x/y - y/x = 9/20 Multiplying both sides by xy, we get x^2 - y^2 = 9xy/20 Simplifying, 20x^2 - 20y^2 = 9xy 20x^2 - 9xy - 20y^2 = 0 We can factor this as (4x - 5y)(5x + 4y) = 0 So either 4x - 5y = 0 or 5x + 4y = 0. If 4x - 5y = 0, then x/y = 5/4. If 5x + 4y = 0, then x/y = -4/5, but this is not a positive proper fraction. Therefore, the answer is (A) 4/5. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
