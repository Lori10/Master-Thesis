  "test_question": "Q: Three friends Alan, Roger and Peter attempt to answer a question on an exam. Alan randomly guesses the answer, giving him a 1/5 probability of guessing correctly. Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, giving him a 2/3 probability of answering correctly. And Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer. What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating? Answer Choices: (A) 1/18 (B) 1/9 (C) 23/90 (D) 5/18 (E) 13/45",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Peter rolls two dice at the same time. What is the probability that the total sum of numbers on the dices is 3? Answer Choices: (A) a)  1/12 (B) b)  1/36 (C) c)  1/6 (D) d)  1/18 (E) e)  1/3\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice, as each die has 6 possible outcomes. To get a sum of 3, the only possible outcomes are (1,2) and (2,1). Therefore, there are only 2 favorable outcomes out of 36 possible outcomes. So, the probability of getting a sum of 3 is 2/36, which simplifies to 1/18. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) d) 1/18. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: In a class, 30% of the students speaks truth, 20% speaks lie and 10% speaks both. If a student is selected at random, what is the probability that he has speak truth or lie? Answer Choices: (A) 1/4 (B) 2/3 (C) 3/5 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the percentage of students who speak either truth or lie. Percentage of students who speak truth = 30% Percentage of students who speak lie = 20% However, we need to subtract the percentage of students who speak both truth and lie, as they have been counted twice. Percentage of students who speak both truth and lie = 10% Therefore, the percentage of students who speak either truth or lie = 30% + 20% - 10% = 40%. So, the probability that a student selected at random speaks truth or lie is 40%. Answer: None of the above (as none of the answer choices match 40%). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: In a game, a person is declared winner, if he gets 4 consecutive tails in five throws of a coin. What is the probability of A to win if he has got a tail in the first throw? Answer Choices: (A) 1/5 (B) 1/4 (C) 1/8 (D) 1/16 (E) 1/6\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that A has already gotten a tail in the first throw. Now, in order to win, A needs to get 3 more consecutive tails in the next 4 throws. The probability of getting a tail in any given throw is 1/2 (assuming a fair coin). So, the probability of getting 4 consecutive tails in 5 throws can be calculated as follows: Probability = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/32 However, we need to take into account that A has already gotten a tail in the first throw. So, we only need to consider the probability of getting 3 consecutive tails in the next 4 throws. Probability = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16 Therefore, the probability of A winning if he has already gotten a tail in the first throw is 1/16. The correct answer is (D) 1/16. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Rajesh solved 80 per cent of the questions in an examination correctly. If out of 41 questions solved by Rajesh 37 questions are correct and of the remaining questions out of 8 questions 5 questions have been solved by Rajesh correctly then find the total number of questions asked in the examination. Answer Choices: (A) 75 (B) 65 (C) 60 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Rajesh solved 80% of the questions correctly. This means that he got 37 questions correct out of a total of x questions. We can write this as: 0.8x = 37 Solving for x, we get: x = 46.25 However, we know that the number of questions asked in the examination must be a whole number. Therefore, we can assume that the actual number of questions asked is either 46 or 47. Next, we know that Rajesh solved a total of 41 questions. Of these, 37 were correct and 4 were incorrect. This means that he attempted 8 - 4 = 4 questions in the remaining set of questions. We also know that he got 5 out of these 8 questions correct. Therefore, the total number of questions asked in the examination is: 37 + 4 + 5 = 46 So the answer is (A) 75. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
