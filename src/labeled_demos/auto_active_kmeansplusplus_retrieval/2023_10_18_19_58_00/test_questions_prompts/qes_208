  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A HEXAGON IS FORMED ABCDEF WHICH PERIMETER 36cm. A POLYGON IS FORMED BY JOINING THE POINTS AE &BD . FIND THE AREA OF THE POLYGON ABDE? Answer Choices: (A) 34\u221a3 cm2 (B) 35\u221a3 cm2 (C) 36\u221a3 cm2 (D) 37\u221a3 cm2 (E) 38\u221a3 cm2\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length of each side of the hexagon. Since the perimeter is 36cm and there are six sides, each side has a length of 6cm. Next, we need to find the area of triangle ABE. We can use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is 1/2 * base * height. The base is AB, which has a length of 6cm. To find the height, we need to draw a perpendicular line from E to AB. Let's call the point where the perpendicular line intersects AB point G. Triangle AEG is a 30-60-90 triangle, so the height EG is 3\u221a3 cm. Therefore, the area of triangle ABE is 1/2 * 6cm * 3\u221a3 cm = 9\u221a3 cm2. We can use the same method to find the area of triangle BDE. The base is BD, which also has a length of 6cm. To find the height, we need to draw a perpendicular line from D to BD. Let's call the point where the perpendicular line intersects BD point H. Triangle BDH is also a 30-60-90 triangle, so the height DH is 3\u221a3 cm. Therefore, the area of triangle BDE is 1/2 * 6cm * 3\u221a3 cm = 9\u221a3 cm2. Finally, we can find the area of the polygon ABDE by adding the areas of triangles ABE and BDE. 9\u221a3 cm2 + 9\u221a3 cm2 = 18\u221a3 cm2. Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) since none of the given answer choices match our calculated answer of 18\u221a3 cm2. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: How many 4-digit Q numbers (ABCD) can be formed such that |A \u2013 D| = 2? Answer Choices: (A) 2,000 (B) 1,900 (C) 1,800 (D) 1,600 (E) 1,500\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that |A \u2013 D| = 2. This means that A and D are either 2 digits apart or 2 digits away from each other in the number line. Case 1: A is 2 digits greater than D. In this case, we can choose any digit from 1 to 9 for D (since it's a 4-digit number, we can't have 0 as the first digit). Then, A can be any digit that is 2 greater than D, except for 9 (since we can't have a 5th digit). So, there are 8 choices for A. Case 2: D is 2 digits greater than A. This is the same as Case 1, but with A and D switched. So, there are also 8 choices for A in this case. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit Q numbers that can be formed is 8 + 8 = 16. The answer is (D) 1,600. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Using all the letters of the word \"NOKIA\", how many words can be formed, which begin with N and end with A? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 24 (C) 62 (D) 78 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to choose the first letter as N, which leaves us with four letters: O, K, I, and A. Next, we need to arrange these four letters in different ways to form words. This can be done in 4! = 24 ways. Finally, we need to ensure that each word ends with A. Out of the four remaining letters, only one is A. Therefore, there is only one way to choose the last letter. So, the total number of words that can be formed is 24 x 1 = 24. Therefore, the answer is (B) 24. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Four different books (A, B, C and D) are to be arranged on a shelf. Books A and B are to be arranged first and second starting from the right of the shelf. The number of different orders in which books C and D may be arranged is Answer Choices: (A) 16! (B) 12! (C) 8! (D) 11! (E) 2!\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we arrange books A and B in 2! = 2 ways. Then, we have two remaining books, C and D, which can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways. Therefore, the total number of different orders in which the four books can be arranged is 2 x 2 = 4. None of the above answer choices match this result, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
