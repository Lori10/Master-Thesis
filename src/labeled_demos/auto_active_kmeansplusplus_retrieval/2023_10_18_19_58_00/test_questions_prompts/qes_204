  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Richard has to paint a mural with seven horizontal stripes. He only has enough paint for four red stripes, four blue stripes, four white stripes. If his patron wants at most two different colors in the mural, how many different ways can he paint the wall? Answer Choices: (A) 210 (B) 350 (C) 700 (D) 2,520 (E) 5,040\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to consider the case where Richard uses only one color. He can choose any of the three colors, so there are 3 ways to paint the mural with only one color. Next, we need to consider the case where Richard uses two colors. He can choose any two colors out of the three, which can be done in 3C2 = 3 ways. For each choice of colors, he can paint the mural in the following ways: - 2 stripes of one color, 5 stripes of the other color: 4C2 x 4C5 = 6 x 4 = 24 - 3 stripes of one color, 4 stripes of the other color: 4C3 x 4C4 = 4 x 1 = 4 So, there are 3 x (24 + 4) = 84 ways to paint the mural with two colors. Therefore, the total number of ways to paint the mural is 3 + 84 = 87. None of the above answer choices match our answer, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The area of a square is 4225 sq cm. Find the ratio of the breadth and the length of a rectangle whose length is twice the side of the square and breadth is 24 cm less than the side of the square. Answer Choices: (A) 5:28 (B) 5:19 (C) 5:12 (D) 5:13 (E) 41:130\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the side of the square. We know that the area of the square is 4225 sq cm, so we can find the side by taking the square root of the area: Side of square = \u221a4225 = 65 cm Next, we need to find the length and breadth of the rectangle. We are given that the length is twice the side of the square, so: Length of rectangle = 2 x 65 = 130 cm We are also given that the breadth is 24 cm less than the side of the square, so: Breadth of rectangle = 65 - 24 = 41 cm Now, we need to find the ratio of the breadth and the length of the rectangle. Ratio of breadth to length = 41:130 Simplifying this ratio by dividing both sides by 41, we get: 1:3.17 Multiplying both sides by 5 to get rid of the decimal, we get: 5:15.83 Rounding off to the nearest whole number, we get: 5:16 Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Find the number of ways you can fill a 3 x 3 grid (with 4 corners defined as a, b, c, d), if you\nhave 3 white marbles and 6 black marbles Answer Choices: (A) 9c3 (B) 9c2 (C) 9c4 (D) 8c3 (E) 7c3\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We need to choose 3 out of 9 cells to place the white marbles. This can be done in 9C3 ways. Step 2: After placing the white marbles, we need to fill the remaining 6 cells with black marbles. This can be done in only one way. Therefore, the total number of ways to fill the grid is 9C3 x 1 = 84. None of the answer choices match the correct answer. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A circular mat with diameter 3.5 inches is placed on a square tabletop, each of whose sides is 6 inches long. Which of the following is closest to the fraction of the tabletop covered by the mat? Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 1 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) 5\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the area of the circular mat. The formula for the area of a circle is A = \u03c0r^2, where r is the radius. The diameter of the mat is 3.5 inches, so the radius is half of that, which is 1.75 inches. Therefore, the area of the mat is: A = \u03c0(1.75)^2 A \u2248 9.62 square inches Next, we need to find the area of the tabletop. The formula for the area of a square is A = s^2, where s is the length of a side. The sides of the tabletop are 6 inches long, so the area of the tabletop is: A = 6^2 A = 36 square inches To find the fraction of the tabletop covered by the mat, we need to divide the area of the mat by the area of the tabletop: 9.62 / 36 \u2248 0.267 This means that the mat covers approximately 26.7% of the tabletop. None of the answer choices given match this result, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
