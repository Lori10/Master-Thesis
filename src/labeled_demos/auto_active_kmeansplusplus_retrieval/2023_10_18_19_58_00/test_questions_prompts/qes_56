  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If the LCM of 9, 7, 2, and q is 504, which of the following could be q? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 6 (D) 9 (E) 5\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the prime factorization of 504: 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7 Next, we need to make sure that q is a factor of 504. Since 504 is divisible by 9, 7, and 2, q must also be a factor of 504. Option A: 7 is already a factor of 504, so it could be q. Option B: 8 is not a factor of 504. Option C: 6 is a factor of 504, but it is not the least common multiple of 9, 7, and 2. Option D: 9 is already a factor of 504, so it could be q. Option E: 5 is not a factor of 504. Therefore, the possible values of q are 7 and 9. Answer: (A) 7 or (D) 9. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: How many 4-digit Q numbers (ABCD) can be formed such that |A \u2013 D| = 2? Answer Choices: (A) 2,000 (B) 1,900 (C) 1,800 (D) 1,600 (E) 1,500\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that |A \u2013 D| = 2. This means that A and D are either 2 digits apart or 2 digits away from each other in the number line. Case 1: A is 2 digits greater than D. In this case, we can choose any digit from 1 to 9 for D (since it's a 4-digit number, we can't have 0 as the first digit). Then, A can be any digit that is 2 greater than D, except for 9 (since we can't have a 5th digit). So, there are 8 choices for A. Case 2: D is 2 digits greater than A. This is the same as Case 1, but with A and D switched. So, there are also 8 choices for A in this case. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit Q numbers that can be formed is 8 + 8 = 16. The answer is (D) 1,600. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: How Many 7\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are there in the following sequence which are immediately preceded by 6 but not immediately followed by 4?\n6 7 4 2 7 4 9 3 6 7 1 9 4 7 2 9 6 7 1 3 6 7 4 3 6 Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Identify all the 7's in the sequence: 6 7 4 2 7 4 9 3 6 7 1 9 4 7 2 9 6 7 1 3 6 7 4 3 6 Step 2: Check if each 7 is immediately preceded by 6 and not immediately followed by 4. Step 3: We find that there are only two 7's that meet this condition: 6 7 1 3 6 and 6 7 4 3 6. Therefore, the answer is (B) 2. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: How many of the positive factors of 19 are not factors of 29? Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 2 (D) 3 (E) 4\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We need to find the positive factors of 19. The factors of 19 are 1 and 19. Now, we need to check which of these factors are not factors of 29. The factors of 29 are 1 and 29. So, the only factor of 19 that is not a factor of 29 is 19 itself. Therefore, the answer is (B) 1. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
