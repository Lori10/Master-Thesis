  "test_question": "Q: 20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold? Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Find the number of ways you can fill a 3 x 3 grid (with 4 corners defined as a, b, c, d), if you\nhave 3 white marbles and 6 black marbles Answer Choices: (A) 9c3 (B) 9c2 (C) 9c4 (D) 8c3 (E) 7c3\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We need to choose 3 out of 9 cells to place the white marbles. This can be done in 9C3 ways. Step 2: After placing the white marbles, we need to fill the remaining 6 cells with black marbles. This can be done in only one way. Therefore, the total number of ways to fill the grid is 9C3 x 1 = 84. None of the answer choices match the correct answer. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A certain ski shop sells pairs of gloves in 10 different colors. If one pair of each color is dropped in a bag and a store clerk reaches in to draw two individual gloves simultaneously and at random, what is the probability that she draws two gloves of the same color? Answer Choices: (A) 1/144 (B) 1/143 (C) 1/24 (D) 1/23 (E) 1/19\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. There are 10 different colors of gloves, so there are 10 pairs of gloves in total. When the store clerk reaches in to draw two individual gloves simultaneously and at random, there are a total of 20 gloves in the bag. To calculate the probability of drawing two gloves of the same color, we need to first calculate the total number of possible outcomes. The total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to choose 2 gloves out of 20, which is: 20 choose 2 = (20 * 19) / (2 * 1) = 190 Next, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to choose 2 gloves of the same color. There are 10 different colors to choose from, so the number of ways to choose 2 gloves of the same color is: 10 choose 1 = 10 For each color, there are 2 gloves to choose from, so the total number of ways to choose 2 gloves of the same color is: 10 * (2 choose 2) = 10 Therefore, the probability of drawing two gloves of the same color is: 10 / 190 = 1/19 So the correct answer is (E) 1/19. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Rajesh solved 80 per cent of the questions in an examination correctly. If out of 41 questions solved by Rajesh 37 questions are correct and of the remaining questions out of 8 questions 5 questions have been solved by Rajesh correctly then find the total number of questions asked in the examination. Answer Choices: (A) 75 (B) 65 (C) 60 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Rajesh solved 80% of the questions correctly. This means that he got 37 questions correct out of a total of x questions. We can write this as: 0.8x = 37 Solving for x, we get: x = 46.25 However, we know that the number of questions asked in the examination must be a whole number. Therefore, we can assume that the actual number of questions asked is either 46 or 47. Next, we know that Rajesh solved a total of 41 questions. Of these, 37 were correct and 4 were incorrect. This means that he attempted 8 - 4 = 4 questions in the remaining set of questions. We also know that he got 5 out of these 8 questions correct. Therefore, the total number of questions asked in the examination is: 37 + 4 + 5 = 46 So the answer is (A) 75. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Richard has to paint a mural with seven horizontal stripes. He only has enough paint for four red stripes, four blue stripes, four white stripes. If his patron wants at most two different colors in the mural, how many different ways can he paint the wall? Answer Choices: (A) 210 (B) 350 (C) 700 (D) 2,520 (E) 5,040\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to consider the case where Richard uses only one color. He can choose any of the three colors, so there are 3 ways to paint the mural with only one color. Next, we need to consider the case where Richard uses two colors. He can choose any two colors out of the three, which can be done in 3C2 = 3 ways. For each choice of colors, he can paint the mural in the following ways: - 2 stripes of one color, 5 stripes of the other color: 4C2 x 4C5 = 6 x 4 = 24 - 3 stripes of one color, 4 stripes of the other color: 4C3 x 4C4 = 4 x 1 = 4 So, there are 3 x (24 + 4) = 84 ways to paint the mural with two colors. Therefore, the total number of ways to paint the mural is 3 + 84 = 87. None of the above answer choices match our answer, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
