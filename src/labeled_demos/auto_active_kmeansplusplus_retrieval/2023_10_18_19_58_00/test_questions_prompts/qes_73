  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A group of 55 adults and 70 children go for trekking. If there is meal for either 70 adults or 90 children and if 28 adults have their meal, find the total number of children that can be catered with the remaining food. Answer Choices: (A) 42 (B) 54 (C) 90 (D) 70 (E) 80\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that there are 55 adults and 70 children, so the total number of people is 55 + 70 = 125. Step 2: We also know that there is enough food for either 70 adults or 90 children. Since there are only 55 adults, we can assume that the remaining food is for the children. Step 3: 28 adults have already had their meal, so the number of adults left is 55 - 28 = 27. Step 4: We need to find out how many children can be catered with the remaining food. Since the remaining food is for either 70 adults or 90 children, we can set up a proportion: 70 adults = 90 children 1 adult = 90/70 children 27 adults = (90/70) x 27 children 27 adults = 34.29 children (rounded to two decimal places) Step 5: Since we can't have a fraction of a child, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the total number of children that can be catered with the remaining food is 35. Answer: None of the above (the closest option is A, but it is not the correct answer). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Elena\u2019s bread recipe calls for 2 ounces of butter for each 5 cups of flour used. She needs to make 4 times the original recipe. If 12 ounces of butter is used, then how many cups of flour are needed? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 4 (C) 9 (D) 13 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much butter is needed for the new recipe. Since Elena needs to make 4 times the original recipe, she will need 4 x 2 = 8 ounces of butter. Next, we can set up a proportion to find out how much flour is needed. We know that for every 2 ounces of butter, 5 cups of flour are used. So, we can write: 2/5 = 8/x where x is the number of cups of flour needed for the new recipe. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 2x = 40 x = 20 Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A certain restaurant offers 7 kinds of cheese and 2 kinds of fruit for its dessert platter. If each dessert platter contains an equal number of kinds of cheese and kinds of fruit, how many different dessert platters could the restaurant offer? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 12 (C) 15 (D) 21 (E) 35\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 7 kinds of cheese and 2 kinds of fruit. To have an equal number of kinds of cheese and fruit, we need to find the common factors of 7 and 2. The only common factor is 1. Therefore, each dessert platter can have only 1 kind of cheese and 1 kind of fruit. To find the total number of different dessert platters, we need to multiply the number of options for cheese and fruit. There are 7 options for cheese and 2 options for fruit. Therefore, the total number of different dessert platters is 7 x 2 = 14. However, we need to divide this number by 2 because the order of cheese and fruit does not matter. Therefore, the final answer is 14/2 = 7. So, the correct answer is (A) 8. None of the given options match the correct answer. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 25 copies per minute. A second copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 55 copies per minute. Working together at their respective rates, how many copies do the two machines make in half an hour ? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 2,400 (C) 4,500 (D) 5,400 (E) 324,000\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the combined rate of the two machines. To do this, we add their individual rates: 25 copies/minute + 55 copies/minute = 80 copies/minute Next, we need to convert half an hour to minutes: 30 minutes Now we can use the formula: rate x time = amount Plugging in the values we have: 80 copies/minute x 30 minutes = 2400 copies Therefore, the answer is (B) 2,400. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
