  "formatted_prompt": "Q: When sold at a 60% discount, a sweater nets the merchant a 20% profit on the wholesale cost at which he initially purchased the item. By what % is the sweater marked up from wholesale at its normal retail price? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 66.67% (D) 80% (E) 100%\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that the wholesale cost of the sweater is $100. If the merchant sells the sweater at a 60% discount, he sells it for 40% of the original price, which is $40. Now, we know that the merchant makes a 20% profit on the wholesale cost at which he initially purchased the item. So, the cost price for the merchant is $100, and he makes a profit of 20%, which is $20. Therefore, the selling price for the merchant is $120. We can now calculate the markup percentage from the wholesale price to the normal retail price. Markup percentage = (Selling price - Wholesale price) / Wholesale price x 100% Markup percentage = ($120 - $100) / $100 x 100% Markup percentage = 20% Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 20%. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: By selling 300 apples a seller gains the selling price of 60 apples. The gain percent of the seller is Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 88 (C) 25 (D) 27 (E) 19\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the selling price of one apple is $1. Therefore, the selling price of 300 apples is $300 and the selling price of 60 apples is $60. The seller gains the selling price of 60 apples, which is $60. Profit percent = (Profit/Cost Price) x 100 Here, the profit is $60 and the cost price is the selling price of 240 apples (300-60), which is $240. Profit percent = (60/240) x 100 = 25% Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 25. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If the selling price is quadrupled,the profit is pentadruple, what is the percentage of profit?? Answer Choices: (A) 50% (B) 100% (C) 150% (D) 200% (E) 250%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the cost price of the item is $100. If the selling price is quadrupled, the new selling price would be $400. Let's say the profit made at the original selling price was $x. If the profit is pentadrupled, the new profit would be $5x. Profit = Selling price - Cost price So, x = Selling price - $100 $5x = $400 - $100 $5x = $300 x = $60 Therefore, the original profit was $60 and the new profit is $300. Percentage increase in profit = (New profit - Original profit) / Original profit * 100 = (300 - 60) / 60 * 100 = 400% So, the answer is (D) 200%. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A shopkeeper sells his goods at cost price but uses a faulty meter that weighs 800 grams. Find the profit percent. Answer Choices: (A) 100/17% (B) 100/23% (C) 100/19% (D) 100/4% (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve the problem step by step. Let's assume that the cost price of the goods is $100. But the shopkeeper uses a faulty meter that weighs 800 grams instead of 1 kilogram (1000 grams). So, the customer gets only 800 grams of goods for the price of 1 kilogram. To find the selling price of 1 kilogram of goods, we can use the formula: Selling price = Cost price / (Weight of goods / Weight sold) Selling price = 100 / (1000 / 800) = $80 So, the shopkeeper is selling 1 kilogram of goods at $80, which is the cost price of 800 grams of goods. Now, let's calculate the profit percent: Profit = Selling price - Cost price = $80 - $100 = -$20 The profit is negative because the shopkeeper is selling the goods at cost price. Profit percent = (Profit / Cost price) x 100 = (-$20 / $100) x 100 = -20% So, the answer is (E) None of these, as none of the given options match the calculated profit percent of -20%. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
