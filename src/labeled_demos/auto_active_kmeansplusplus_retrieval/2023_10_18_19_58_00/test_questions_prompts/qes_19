  "test_question": "Q: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are : Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 25 (D) 26 (E) 27",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A club with a total membership of 25 has formed 3 committees, M, S and R, which have 8, 12 and 5 members respectively. If no members of committee M is on either of the other 2 committees, what is the greatest possible number of members in the club who are on none of the committees? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 7 (C) 8 (D) 10 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of members who are on the committees. M has 8 members, S has 12 members, and R has 5 members. Since no members of M are on either of the other 2 committees, we can subtract the 8 members of M from the total number of committee members: Total committee members = 8 + 12 + 5 - 8 = 17 So, there are 17 members on the committees. To find the greatest possible number of members who are on none of the committees, we need to subtract this number from the total membership of the club: Greatest possible number of members not on committees = 25 - 17 = 8 Therefore, the answer is (C) 8. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The 30 members of a club decided to play a badminton singles tournament. Every time a member loses a game he is out of the tournament. There are no ties. What is the minimum number of matches that must be played to determine the winner ? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 29 (C) 64 (D) 39 (E) 35\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine how many rounds of matches will be played. Since each match eliminates one player, there will be 29 matches in the first round (30 players divided into 15 matches). After the first round, there will be 15 players left, so there will be 7 matches in the second round (8 players divided into 4 matches) and 4 matches in the third round (4 players divided into 2 matches). Finally, there will be one match in the fourth round to determine the winner. Therefore, the total number of matches played will be 29 + 7 + 4 + 1 = 41. None of the answer choices match our calculation, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A firm has 3 senior partners and 6 junior partners. How many different groups of 3 partners can be formed in which at least one member of the group is a senior partner? (Note that two groups are considered different if at least one group member is different.) Answer Choices: (A) 64 (B) 68 (C) 72 (D) 76 (E) 80\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of ways to form a group of 3 partners from 9 partners (3 senior + 6 junior). This can be done using the combination formula: C(9,3) = 84 Step 2: Find the number of ways to form a group of 3 partners in which all members are junior partners. This can be done using the combination formula: C(6,3) = 20 Step 3: Find the number of ways to form a group of 3 partners in which no senior partner is included. This can be done by selecting 3 junior partners from the 6 available: C(6,3) = 20 Step 4: Subtract the number of groups in Step 2 and Step 3 from the total number of groups in Step 1 to get the number of groups in which at least one senior partner is included: 84 - 20 - 20 = 44 Therefore, the answer is (None of the above). The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The average age of 8 men is increased by 2 years. When two of them, whose ages are 20 years and 24 years respectively are replaced by two women. What is the average age of these women? Answer Choices: (A) 36 years (B) 30 years (C) 40 years (D) 42 years (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the original average age of the 8 men. Let's call this \"x\". Then, we know that the average age is increased by 2 years, so the new average age is \"x+2\". Next, we replace two men with two women. Let's call the ages of the two women \"a\" and \"b\". We know that the total age of the 8 men is 8x, and the total age of the 2 men we are replacing is 20+24=44. So, the total age of the 6 remaining men is 8x-44. When we add the ages of the two women, the total age becomes (8x-44)+a+b. We want to find the new average age, so we need to divide this total age by the new number of people, which is 8 (since we still have 8 people, just with 2 women instead of 2 men). So, the new average age is [(8x-44)+a+b]/8. We want to simplify this expression and solve for the average age of the two women, so let's start by distributing the division: [(8x-44)+a+b]/8 = (8x-44)/8 + (a+b)/8 We know that the first term on the right side is the new average age of the 6 remaining men, which is x+2. So, we can substitute that in: (x+2) + (a+b)/8 = x+2 Now we can solve for (a+b)/8: (a+b)/8 = 0 This means that the sum of the ages of the two women is 0, which is impossible. Therefore, the answer is (E) None of these. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
