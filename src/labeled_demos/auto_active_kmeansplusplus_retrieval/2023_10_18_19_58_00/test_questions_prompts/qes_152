  "test_question": "Q: The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number. Answer Choices: (A) 368 (B) 377 (C) 288 (D) 997 (E) 112",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Find the odd man out. 187, 264, 316, 473, 682, 781 Answer Choices: (A) 187 (B) 316 (C) 781 (D) 682 (E) 473\nA: Let's think step by step. The numbers seem random, so we need to find a pattern or rule that applies to all except one of the numbers. If we look at the last digit of each number, we can see that they alternate between odd and even: 7, 4, 6, 3, 2, 1. However, this pattern doesn't apply to 316, which ends in an even digit. Therefore, the odd man out is (B) 316. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: How many 4-digit Q numbers (ABCD) can be formed such that |A \u2013 D| = 2? Answer Choices: (A) 2,000 (B) 1,900 (C) 1,800 (D) 1,600 (E) 1,500\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that |A \u2013 D| = 2. This means that A and D are either 2 digits apart or 2 digits away from each other in the number line. Case 1: A is 2 digits greater than D. In this case, we can choose any digit from 1 to 9 for D (since it's a 4-digit number, we can't have 0 as the first digit). Then, A can be any digit that is 2 greater than D, except for 9 (since we can't have a 5th digit). So, there are 8 choices for A. Case 2: D is 2 digits greater than A. This is the same as Case 1, but with A and D switched. So, there are also 8 choices for A in this case. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit Q numbers that can be formed is 8 + 8 = 16. The answer is (D) 1,600. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Find the invalid no.from the following series 10, 17, 22, 29, 34, 36 Answer Choices: (A) 36 (B) 18 (C) 40 (D) 37 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. The given series is 10, 17, 22, 29, 34, 36. To find the invalid number, we need to identify the pattern in the series. The pattern is that each number is obtained by adding 5 or 7 to the previous number. 10 + 7 = 17 17 + 5 = 22 22 + 7 = 29 29 + 5 = 34 34 + 2 = 36 The invalid number is 36 because it is not obtained by adding 5 or 7 to the previous number. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 36. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: 1397 x 1397 = ? Answer Choices: (A) 1961609 (B) 1851609 (C) 1951619 (D) 1951609 (E) 1851619\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the formula (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 to solve this problem. In this case, a = 1397 and b = 1397. So, (1397 + 1397)^2 = 1397^2 + 2(1397)(1397) + 1397^2 Simplifying this expression, we get: = 1951609 Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 1951609. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
