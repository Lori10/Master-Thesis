  "test_question": "Q: If a man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph, then the man's rate along the current is: Answer Choices: (A) 15 kmph (B) 6 kmph (C) 12 kmph (D) 14 kmph (E) 6 kmph",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A man can row his boat with the stream at 18 km/h and against the stream in 8 km/h. The man's rate is? Answer Choices: (A) 5 kmph (B) 2 kmph (C) 7 kmph (D) 8 kmph (E) 3 kmph\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the speed of the stream be x km/h and the speed of the man be y km/h. When the man rows with the stream, his effective speed is (y + x) km/h. When the man rows against the stream, his effective speed is (y - x) km/h. We are given that: (y + x) = 18 km/h (y - x) = 8 km/h Adding the two equations, we get: 2y = 26 km/h y = 13 km/h Therefore, the man's rate is 13 km/h. The answer is not in the given options. Hence, the answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A boat having a length 3 m and breadth 2 m is floating on a lake. The boat sinks by 1.2 cm when a man gets on it. The mass of man is Answer Choices: (A) 72 kg (B) 60 kg (C) 72 kg (D) 96 kg (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the volume of water displaced by the boat before the man gets on it. Volume of water displaced = length x breadth x height of displacement = 3m x 2m x 0.012m (1.2 cm converted to meters) = 0.072 cubic meters Now, when the man gets on the boat, the boat sinks by 1.2 cm more. So, the new height of displacement is 0.024m (0.012m + 0.012m). Let's assume the density of water is 1000 kg/m^3. The weight of water displaced by the boat before the man gets on it = volume of water displaced x density of water = 0.072m^3 x 1000 kg/m^3 = 72 kg The weight of water displaced by the boat after the man gets on it = (volume of water displaced + additional displacement due to the man) x density of water = (3m x 2m x 0.024m) x 1000 kg/m^3 = 1.44 kg Therefore, the weight of the man = weight of water displaced before the man gets on the boat - weight of water displaced after the man gets on the boat = 72 kg - 1.44 kg = 70.56 kg So, the answer is (E) None of the above. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A man cycles round the boundary of a rectangular park at the rate of 12 kmph and completes one full round in 8 minutes. If the ratio between the length and breadth of the park be 3:2, then its area is: Answer Choices: (A) 1536m2 (B) 15360m2 (C) 153600m2 (D) 163600m2 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular park. Let the length and breadth of the park be 3x and 2x respectively (as given in the ratio 3:2). Perimeter of the park = 2(Length + Breadth) = 2(3x + 2x) = 10x Now, we know that the man cycles round the park at the rate of 12 kmph. In 1 hour, he covers a distance of 12 km. In 1 minute, he covers a distance of 12/60 = 0.2 km = 200 m. In 8 minutes, he covers a distance of 200 x 8 = 1600 m = 1.6 km. We also know that in 8 minutes, he completes one full round of the park. Therefore, 10x = 1.6 km x = 160 m Length of the park = 3x = 480 m Breadth of the park = 2x = 320 m Area of the park = Length x Breadth = 480 x 320 = 153600 m\u00b2 Hence, the correct answer is (C) 153600m\u00b2. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: What would happen in the previous question if both A and B had started at point P. Answer Choices: (A) 800 Km (B) 600 Km (C) 1000 Km (D) 350 Km (E) 250 Km\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that A travels at a speed of 50 km/h and B travels at a speed of 40 km/h. If they both started at point P, they would be moving in opposite directions. Let's say they meet after x hours. In that time, A would have traveled 50x km and B would have traveled 40x km. We also know that the distance between A and B is 600 km. So, we can set up the equation: 50x + 40x = 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 90x = 600 x = 6.67 hours Now that we know they meet after 6.67 hours, we can find out how far each of them has traveled: A: 50 km/h x 6.67 h = 333.33 km B: 40 km/h x 6.67 h = 266.67 km The total distance they have traveled is: 333.33 km + 266.67 km = 600 km Therefore, the answer is (B) 600 km. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
