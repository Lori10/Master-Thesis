  "test_question": "Q: A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field? Answer Choices: (A) 51 days (B) 61 days (C) 71 days (D) 81 days (E) 91 days",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A, B and C rent a pasture. A puts 10 oxen for 7 months, B puts 12 oxen for 5 months and C puts 15 oxen for 3 months for grazing. If the rent of the pasture is Rs. 245, how much must C pay as his share of rent? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 50 (C) 55 (D) 63 (E) none\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of oxen-months contributed by all three people. A contributed 10 oxen for 7 months, so that's 10 x 7 = 70 oxen-months. B contributed 12 oxen for 5 months, so that's 12 x 5 = 60 oxen-months. C contributed 15 oxen for 3 months, so that's 15 x 3 = 45 oxen-months. The total number of oxen-months is 70 + 60 + 45 = 175. Now we need to find out what fraction of the total rent C should pay. C contributed 45 oxen-months out of a total of 175, which is 45/175. To find out how much C should pay, we need to multiply this fraction by the total rent: (45/175) x 245 = 63 So C should pay Rs. 63 as his share of the rent. The correct answer is (D) 63. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A fort had provision of food for 150 men for 60 days. After 10 days, 25 men left the fort. The number of days for which the remaining food will last, is: Answer Choices: (A) 29 1/5 (B) 37 1/4 (C) 42 (D) 54 (E) 60\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total amount of food available in the fort. The provision of food for 150 men for 60 days means that the fort has food for 150 x 60 = 9000 man-days. Step 2: Find the amount of food consumed in the first 10 days. Since there were 150 men in the fort for the first 10 days, the amount of food consumed in the first 10 days is 150 x 10 = 1500 man-days. Step 3: Find the amount of food remaining after 10 days. The amount of food remaining after 10 days is 9000 - 1500 = 7500 man-days. Step 4: Find the number of men remaining in the fort. After 25 men left the fort, the number of men remaining in the fort is 150 - 25 = 125. Step 5: Find the number of days for which the remaining food will last. Let's assume that the remaining food will last for x days. Since the same amount of food is now available for 125 men, the amount of food required for x days is 125x man-days. We know that this amount of food is equal to the remaining food in the fort, which is 7500 man-days. Therefore, we can write the equation: 125x = 7500 Solving for x, we get: x = 60 Therefore, the remaining food will last for 60 days. Answer: (E) 60 The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A man cycles round the boundary of a rectangular park at the rate of 12 kmph and completes one full round in 8 minutes. If the ratio between the length and breadth of the park be 3:2, then its area is: Answer Choices: (A) 1536m2 (B) 15360m2 (C) 153600m2 (D) 163600m2 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular park. Let the length and breadth of the park be 3x and 2x respectively (as given in the ratio 3:2). Perimeter of the park = 2(Length + Breadth) = 2(3x + 2x) = 10x Now, we know that the man cycles round the park at the rate of 12 kmph. In 1 hour, he covers a distance of 12 km. In 1 minute, he covers a distance of 12/60 = 0.2 km = 200 m. In 8 minutes, he covers a distance of 200 x 8 = 1600 m = 1.6 km. We also know that in 8 minutes, he completes one full round of the park. Therefore, 10x = 1.6 km x = 160 m Length of the park = 3x = 480 m Breadth of the park = 2x = 320 m Area of the park = Length x Breadth = 480 x 320 = 153600 m\u00b2 Hence, the correct answer is (C) 153600m\u00b2. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A work which could be finished in 10 days was finished 3 days earlier after 10 more men joined. The number of men employed was? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 20 (C) 88 (D) 71 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the number of men initially employed be x. Then, the work done in 1 day by x men is 1/10 and the work done in 1 day by (x+10) men is 1/(10-3) = 1/7 (since the work was finished 3 days earlier). Now, we can set up an equation based on the work done by x men and (x+10) men: x/10 + (x+10)/7 = 1 Multiplying both sides by 70 (the least common multiple of 10 and 7) gives: 7x + 10(x+10) = 70 Simplifying and solving for x gives: 17x = 60 x = 60/17 Since x is not a whole number, none of the answer choices are correct. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is No answer.\n\n\n"
