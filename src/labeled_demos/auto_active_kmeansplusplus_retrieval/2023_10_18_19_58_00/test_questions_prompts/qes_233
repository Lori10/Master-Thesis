  "formatted_prompt": "Q: An elevator starts with 5 pasengers and stops at 8 different floors of the house. Find out the probability of all the 5 passengers alighting at different floors. Answer Choices: (A) 90 / 512 (B) 105 / 512 (C) 15/512 (D) 30/512 (E) 48/512\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 8 floors and 5 passengers, so the first passenger has 8 choices of floors to get off at. The second passenger has 7 choices of floors left, the third passenger has 6 choices, the fourth passenger has 5 choices, and the last passenger has 4 choices. Therefore, the total number of ways that the passengers can get off at different floors is: 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 = 6,720 Now, we need to find the total number of ways that the passengers can get off at any floor. This is simply: 8^5 = 32,768 So, the probability of all the passengers getting off at different floors is: 6,720 / 32,768 = 105 / 512 Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 105 / 512. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: We have 4 people and 1 chairs. In how many ways chairs can be occupy? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 86 (C) 24 (D) 14 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. If we have 4 people and only 1 chair, then only one person can sit on the chair at a time. So, we need to find the number of ways in which we can choose one person out of 4 to sit on the chair. The number of ways to choose one person out of 4 is 4. Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. None of the other options are correct as they are either too high or too low for the given scenario. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Four different books (A, B, C and D) are to be arranged on a shelf. Books A and B are to be arranged first and second starting from the right of the shelf. The number of different orders in which books C and D may be arranged is Answer Choices: (A) 16! (B) 12! (C) 8! (D) 11! (E) 2!\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we arrange books A and B in 2! = 2 ways. Then, we have two remaining books, C and D, which can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways. Therefore, the total number of different orders in which the four books can be arranged is 2 x 2 = 4. None of the above answer choices match this result, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Using all the letters of the word \"NOKIA\", how many words can be formed, which begin with N and end with A? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 24 (C) 62 (D) 78 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to choose the first letter as N, which leaves us with four letters: O, K, I, and A. Next, we need to arrange these four letters in different ways to form words. This can be done in 4! = 24 ways. Finally, we need to ensure that each word ends with A. Out of the four remaining letters, only one is A. Therefore, there is only one way to choose the last letter. So, the total number of words that can be formed is 24 x 1 = 24. Therefore, the answer is (B) 24. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
