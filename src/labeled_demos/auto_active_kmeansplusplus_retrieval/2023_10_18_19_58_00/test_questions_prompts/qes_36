  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Which of the following inequalities has a solution set, when graphed on the number line, is a single line segment of finite length? Answer Choices: (A) 2 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (B) 3 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (C) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (D) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (E) 4 <= 3x+4 <= 6\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to isolate the variable (x) in the inequality. We can do this by subtracting 4 from all parts of the inequality: (A) 2 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes -2 <= 3x <= 2 (B) 3 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes -1 <= 3x <= 2 (C) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes 1 <= 3x <= 2 (D) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes 1 <= 3x <= 2 (E) 4 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes 0 <= 3x <= 2 Now we can divide all parts of the inequality by 3: (A) -2/3 <= x <= 2/3 (B) -1/3 <= x <= 2/3 (C) 1/3 <= x <= 2/3 (D) 1/3 <= x <= 2/3 (E) 0 <= x <= 2/3 Option (C) has a solution set that is a single line segment of finite length, from x=1/3 to x=2/3. Therefore, the correct answer is (C). The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If 100<x<199 and 9<y<100, then the product xy CANNOT be equal to: Answer Choices: (A) 19,104 (B) 19,303 (C) 19,956.732 (D) 19,502 (E) 19,809\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 100 < x < 199 and 9 < y < 100. Therefore, the minimum value of xy occurs when x is at its minimum value of 101 and y is at its minimum value of 10. So, the minimum value of xy is 101 * 10 = 1010. Now, let's check each answer choice to see if it is possible for xy to equal that value: (A) 19,104 = 96 * 199, which is not possible since y must be less than 100. (B) 19,303 = 97 * 199, which is not possible since y must be less than 100. (C) 19,956.732 is not a whole number, so it is not possible. (D) 19,502 = 98 * 199, which is not possible since y must be less than 100. (E) 19,809 = 99 * 201, which is possible since both x and y are within the given ranges. Therefore, the answer is (E) 19,809. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: The difference between a positive proper fraction and its reciprocal is 9/20. The fraction is? Answer Choices: (A) 4/5 (B) 4/7 (C) 5 (D) 5/7 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the fraction be x/y. According to the problem, x/y - y/x = 9/20 Multiplying both sides by xy, we get x^2 - y^2 = 9xy/20 Simplifying, 20x^2 - 20y^2 = 9xy 20x^2 - 9xy - 20y^2 = 0 We can factor this as (4x - 5y)(5x + 4y) = 0 So either 4x - 5y = 0 or 5x + 4y = 0. If 4x - 5y = 0, then x/y = 5/4. If 5x + 4y = 0, then x/y = -4/5, but this is not a positive proper fraction. Therefore, the answer is (A) 4/5. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A numberais squared and then multiplied by negative 3. The result of this operation T is equal to three times the sum of three timesaand two. What is one possible value ofa? Answer Choices: (A) -3 (B) -2 (C) 1 (D) 2 (E) 3\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's translate the given information into an equation. a^2 * (-3) = 3(3a + 2) Simplifying the right side of the equation: a^2 * (-3) = 9a + 6 Multiplying both sides by -1 to get rid of the negative coefficient: a^2 * 3 = -9a - 6 Bringing all terms to one side: a^2 * 3 + 9a + 6 = 0 Now we can solve for a using the quadratic formula: a = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a a = (-9 \u00b1 sqrt(9^2 - 4(3)(6))) / 2(3) a = (-9 \u00b1 sqrt(57)) / 6 a \u2248 -2.07 or a \u2248 -1.26 Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\n"
