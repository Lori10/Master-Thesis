  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If $10,000 is invested at x percent simple annual interest for n years, which of the following represents the total amount of interest, in dollars, that will be earned by this investment in the n years? Answer Choices: (A) 10,000(x^n)  (B) 10,000(x/100) ^n (C) 10,000n(x/100)  (D) 10,000(1+x/100) ^n (E) 10,000n(1+x/100) \nA: Let's think step by step. The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time In this case, the principal is $10,000, the rate is x percent (which we need to convert to a decimal by dividing by 100), and the time is n years. So, the total amount of interest earned in n years is: Interest = 10,000 * (x/100) * n Simplifying this expression, we get: Interest = 100 * x * n Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 10,000n(x/100). The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Mike invested Rs. 3750 in a scheme for 3 years at compound interest rate 6.5% p.a. How much amount will Mike get on maturity of the fixed deposit? Answer Choices: (A) s.4581.29 (B) s.4450 (C) s.4500 (D) s.4500.25 (E) s.4529.81\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the formula for compound interest to solve this problem: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) Where: A = the amount at the end of the investment P = the principal amount (initial investment) r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal) n = the number of times the interest is compounded per year t = the time period of the investment (in years) Plugging in the given values, we get: A = 3750(1 + 0.065/1)^(1*3) A = 3750(1.065)^3 A = 3750(1.207) A = 4522.50 Therefore, the closest answer choice is (E) s.4529.81. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In order to obtain an income of Rs. 650 from 10% stock at Rs. 96, one must make an investment of Answer Choices: (A) 5363 (B) 6240 (C) 2368 (D) 1987 (E) 2732\nA: Let's think step by step. The annual income from the stock is 10% of the investment. So, we can set up the equation: 10% of the investment = Rs. 650 0.1 x investment = 650 investment = 650 / 0.1 investment = Rs. 6,500 Now, we need to find out how many shares can be bought with an investment of Rs. 6,500 at Rs. 96 per share. Number of shares = investment / share price Number of shares = 6,500 / 96 Number of shares = 67.71 (approx.) Since we cannot buy a fraction of a share, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Number of shares = 68 Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 2732, which is the total investment required to buy 68 shares at Rs. 96 per share. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A invested $300 in a business after 6 months B invested $200 in the business. End of the year if they got $100 as profit. Find A shares? Answer Choices: (A) $100 (B) $75 (C) $20 (D) $120 (E) $50\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total investment made by A and B. A invested $300 for 12 months, so his total investment is $300 * 12 = $3600. B invested $200 for 12 months, so his total investment is $200 * 12 = $2400. Next, we need to find the ratio of their investments. A invested $3600 and B invested $2400, so the ratio of their investments is 3600:2400, which simplifies to 3:2. Now, we need to find A's share of the profit. Since the ratio of their investments is 3:2, A's share of the profit is 3/5 of the total profit. Therefore, A's share of the profit is $100 * 3/5 = $60. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above, as none of the given answer choices match the calculated answer of $60. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
