  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Kiran has 85 currency notes in all, some of which were of Rs. 100 denomination and the\nremaining of Rs. 50 denomination. The total amount of all these currency notes was Rs.\n5000. How much amount did she have in the denomination of Rs. 50?\nA. B. C. None of these D.\nAnswer: Option B\nExplanation: Answer Choices: (A) 1900 (B) 3500 (C) 4000 (D) 2000 (E) 2500\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the number of Rs. 100 notes be x and the number of Rs. 50 notes be y. We know that x + y = 85 (total number of notes) and 100x + 50y = 5000 (total amount). Simplifying the second equation, we get 2x + y = 100. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get x = 25 and y = 60. Therefore, the amount in the denomination of Rs. 50 is 50 * 60 = 3000. So, the correct answer is option B. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Paul's income is 40% less than Rex's income, Quentin's income is 20% less than Paul's income, and Sam's income is 40% less than Paul's income. If Rex gave 40% of his income to Sam and 60% of his income to Quentin, Quentin's new income would be what fraction of Sam's new income? Answer Choices: (A) \t11/12 (B) \t13/17 (C) \t13/19 (D) \t12/19 (E) \t27/19\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume Rex's income to be 100. Then, Paul's income would be 60 (40% less than Rex's income). Quentin's income would be 48 (20% less than Paul's income). Sam's income would be 36 (40% less than Paul's income). If Rex gave 40% of his income to Sam, Sam's new income would be 76 (40% of 100 is 40, so Rex would have 60 left to give to Quentin and keep for himself). If Rex gave 60% of his income to Quentin, Quentin's new income would be 88 (60% of 100 is 60, so Quentin would have 48 from his original income and 60 from Rex's gift). So, Quentin's new income is 88/76 = 22/19 of Sam's new income. Therefore, the answer is (E) 27/19. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Seventy five percent of a number is 21 less than four fifth of that number. What is the number ? Answer Choices: (A) 240 (B) 340 (C) 420 (D) 130 (E) 125\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the number to be 'x'. According to the problem, 75% of the number is 21 less than 4/5 of the number. Translating this into an equation: 0.75x = (4/5)x - 21 Simplifying this equation: 0.75x - (4/5)x = -21 (15/20)x - (16/20)x = -21 (-1/20)x = -21 x = (-21) * (-20) x = 420 Therefore, the answer is (C) 420. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A, B and C rent a pasture. A puts 10 oxen for 7 months, B puts 12 oxen for 5 months and C puts 15 oxen for 3 months for grazing. If the rent of the pasture is Rs. 245, how much must C pay as his share of rent? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 50 (C) 55 (D) 63 (E) none\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of oxen-months contributed by all three people. A contributed 10 oxen for 7 months, so that's 10 x 7 = 70 oxen-months. B contributed 12 oxen for 5 months, so that's 12 x 5 = 60 oxen-months. C contributed 15 oxen for 3 months, so that's 15 x 3 = 45 oxen-months. The total number of oxen-months is 70 + 60 + 45 = 175. Now we need to find out what fraction of the total rent C should pay. C contributed 45 oxen-months out of a total of 175, which is 45/175. To find out how much C should pay, we need to multiply this fraction by the total rent: (45/175) x 245 = 63 So C should pay Rs. 63 as his share of the rent. The correct answer is (D) 63. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
