  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In a group of ducks and cows, the total number of legs are 26 more than twice the no. of heads. Find the total no.of buffaloes. Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 12 (C) 13 (D) 16 (E) 18\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume there are x ducks and y cows in the group. So, the total number of heads will be x + y. Each duck has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs. So, the total number of legs will be 2x + 4y. According to the problem, 2(x + y) + 26 = 2x + 4y Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x - 2y = 26 x - y = 13 We need to find the total number of buffaloes, which is not given in the problem. So, we cannot find the answer with the given information. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Let f(x,y) be defined as the remainder when (x\u2013y)! is divided by x. If x=16, what is the maximum value of y for which f(x,y)=0? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 10 (C) 15 (D) 20 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the value of (x-y)!. Since x=16, we have (16-y)!. Next, we need to find the remainder when (16-y)! is divided by 16. This means we need to find the largest value of y such that (16-y)! is divisible by 16. We know that 16=2^4, so we need to find the largest power of 2 that divides (16-y)!. We can use the formula for the highest power of a prime p that divides n!, which is given by: \u230an/p\u230b + \u230an/p^2\u230b + \u230an/p^3\u230b + ... where \u230ax\u230b denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. In this case, p=2 and n=16-y, so we have: \u230a(16-y)/2\u230b + \u230a(16-y)/4\u230b + \u230a(16-y)/8\u230b + \u230a(16-y)/16\u230b Simplifying this expression, we get: 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15 So the largest power of 2 that divides (16-y)! is 2^15. Therefore, the maximum value of y for which f(x,y)=0 is 15. The answer is (C) 15. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The difference between a positive proper fraction and its reciprocal is 9/20. The fraction is? Answer Choices: (A) 4/5 (B) 4/7 (C) 5 (D) 5/7 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the fraction be x/y. According to the problem, x/y - y/x = 9/20 Multiplying both sides by xy, we get x^2 - y^2 = 9xy/20 Simplifying, 20x^2 - 20y^2 = 9xy 20x^2 - 9xy - 20y^2 = 0 We can factor this as (4x - 5y)(5x + 4y) = 0 So either 4x - 5y = 0 or 5x + 4y = 0. If 4x - 5y = 0, then x/y = 5/4. If 5x + 4y = 0, then x/y = -4/5, but this is not a positive proper fraction. Therefore, the answer is (A) 4/5. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: If the positive integer x is divisible by 3, 8, and 12, then which of the following must x be divisible by?\nI. 24\nII. 26\nIII. 48 Answer Choices: (A) IIonly (B) I only (C) I and II only (D) II and III only (E) I, II, and III\nA: Let's think step by step. If x is divisible by 3, 8, and 12, then it must be divisible by their least common multiple (LCM). The LCM of 3, 8, and 12 is 24. Therefore, x must be divisible by 24. Option I is correct. To check the other options: II. 26 is not a multiple of 3, 8, or 12, so x does not have to be divisible by 26. III. 48 is a multiple of 3, 8, and 12, but we already know that x is divisible by their LCM, which is 24. Therefore, x does not have to be divisible by 48. The correct answer is (B) I only. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
