  "test_question": "Q: A box contains a certain number of balls, marked successively from 1 to n. If there are 45 different ways that two balls can be selected from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, then what is the value of n? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 10 (C) 9 (D) 8 (E) 7",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The number of sequences in which 5 players can throw a ball, so that the youngest player may not be the last is ? Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 96 (C) 8 (D) 62 (E) 10\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of sequences in which 5 players can throw a ball. This can be calculated as 5! (5 factorial) which is equal to 120. Next, we need to find the number of sequences in which the youngest player is the last. In this case, we can fix the youngest player in the last position and arrange the remaining 4 players in 4! ways. So, the number of sequences in which the youngest player is the last is 4!. Therefore, the number of sequences in which the youngest player may not be the last is the difference between the total number of sequences and the number of sequences in which the youngest player is the last. This is equal to 120 - 4! = 120 - 24 = 96. Hence, the correct answer is (B) 96. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: We have 4 people and 1 chairs. In how many ways chairs can be occupy? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 86 (C) 24 (D) 14 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. If we have 4 people and only 1 chair, then only one person can sit on the chair at a time. So, we need to find the number of ways in which we can choose one person out of 4 to sit on the chair. The number of ways to choose one person out of 4 is 4. Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. None of the other options are correct as they are either too high or too low for the given scenario. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Four different books (A, B, C and D) are to be arranged on a shelf. Books A and B are to be arranged first and second starting from the right of the shelf. The number of different orders in which books C and D may be arranged is Answer Choices: (A) 16! (B) 12! (C) 8! (D) 11! (E) 2!\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we arrange books A and B in 2! = 2 ways. Then, we have two remaining books, C and D, which can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways. Therefore, the total number of different orders in which the four books can be arranged is 2 x 2 = 4. None of the above answer choices match this result, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A dog breeder currently has 9 breeding dogs. 6 of the dogs have exactly 1 littermate, and 3 of the dogs have exactly 2 littermates. If 2 dogs are selected at random, what is the probability Q that both selected dogs are NOT littermates? Answer Choices: (A) 1/6 (B) 2/9 (C) 5/6 (D) 7/9 (E) 8/9\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of ways to choose 2 dogs out of 9. This can be done using the combination formula: C(9,2) = 9! / (2! * 7!) = 36 So there are 36 possible pairs of dogs that can be selected. Next, we need to find the number of pairs of dogs that are littermates. For the 6 dogs with exactly 1 littermate, each dog has only one possible littermate, so there are 6 pairs of littermates. For the 3 dogs with exactly 2 littermates, each dog has 2 possible littermates, so there are 3 * 2 = 6 pairs of littermates. So there are a total of 6 + 6 = 12 pairs of littermates. Finally, we can use the formula for probability: Q = (number of pairs that are not littermates) / (total number of pairs) Q = (36 - 12) / 36 = 24 / 36 = 2/3 Therefore, the answer is (B) 2/9. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
