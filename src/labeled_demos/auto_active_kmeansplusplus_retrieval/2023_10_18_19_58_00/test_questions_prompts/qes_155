  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Rahim bought 65 books for Rs.1150 from one shop and 50 books for Rs.920 from another. What is the average price he paid per book ? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 18 (C) 99 (D) 787 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total cost of all the books Rahim bought. Total cost = Rs.1150 + Rs.920 = Rs.2070 Next, we need to find the total number of books Rahim bought. Total number of books = 65 + 50 = 115 Finally, we can find the average price per book by dividing the total cost by the total number of books. Average price per book = Total cost / Total number of books Average price per book = Rs.2070 / 115 Average price per book = Rs.18 Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 18. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Gautami went to the stationers and bought things worth Rs. 100, out of which 50 paise went on sales tax on taxable purchases. If the tax rate was 5%. then what was the cost of the tax free items? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 99.50 (B) Rs. 70.50 (C) Rs. 89.50 (D) Rs. 69.50 (E) Rs. 80.50\nA: Let's think step by step. The total cost of the items including tax is Rs. 100. Out of this, 50 paise (or Rs. 0.50) went on sales tax. We know that the tax rate is 5%. So, we can set up an equation: 5% of the taxable purchases = Rs. 0.50 To find the cost of tax-free items, we need to subtract the tax amount from the total cost: Cost of tax-free items = Total cost - Tax amount Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 100 - Rs. 0.50 Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 99.50 Therefore, the answer is (A) Rs. 99.50. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: If a quarter kg of potato costs 60 paise, how many paise does 200 gm cost? Answer Choices: (A) 65 paise (B) 70 paise (C) 52 paise (D) 48 paise (E) 75 paise\nA: Let's think step by step. Given, 1/4 kg of potato costs 60 paise. We need to find the cost of 200 gm of potato. 1/4 kg = 250 gm So, 250 gm of potato costs 60 paise. Now, we need to find the cost of 200 gm of potato. We can use the unitary method to solve this problem. 250 gm costs 60 paise 1 gm costs (60/250) paise 200 gm costs (60/250) x 200 = 48 paise Therefore, the answer is (D) 48 paise. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A group of 55 adults and 70 children go for trekking. If there is meal for either 70 adults or 90 children and if 28 adults have their meal, find the total number of children that can be catered with the remaining food. Answer Choices: (A) 42 (B) 54 (C) 90 (D) 70 (E) 80\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that there are 55 adults and 70 children, so the total number of people is 55 + 70 = 125. Step 2: We also know that there is enough food for either 70 adults or 90 children. Since there are only 55 adults, we can assume that the remaining food is for the children. Step 3: 28 adults have already had their meal, so the number of adults left is 55 - 28 = 27. Step 4: We need to find out how many children can be catered with the remaining food. Since the remaining food is for either 70 adults or 90 children, we can set up a proportion: 70 adults = 90 children 1 adult = 90/70 children 27 adults = (90/70) x 27 children 27 adults = 34.29 children (rounded to two decimal places) Step 5: Since we can't have a fraction of a child, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the total number of children that can be catered with the remaining food is 35. Answer: None of the above (the closest option is A, but it is not the correct answer). The answer is A.\n\n\n"
