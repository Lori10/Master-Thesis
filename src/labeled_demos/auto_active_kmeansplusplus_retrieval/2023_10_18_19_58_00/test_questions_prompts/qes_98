  "test_question": "Q: Roberts has a property worth of $1023.65. But in a record his property worth is written as greatest positive even integer less than or equal to his property worth and it is divisible by 100. Find the difference between actual property and recorded property worth? Answer Choices: (A) 23.65 (B) 1000 (C) 35.62 (D) 2.65 (E) 1023.65",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Peter has $642,986 in his savings account. What is the least amount of money (in whole number of dollars) that he must add to his account if he wants to split this money evenly among his nine children? Answer Choices: (A) $642,986 (B) $642,987 (C) $642,988 (D) $642,989 (E) $642,990\nA: Let's think step by step. Peter wants to split his savings evenly among his nine children. This means he needs to divide his savings by 9 to find out how much each child will get. $642,986 \u00f7 9 = $71,443.88 However, we need to add a whole number of dollars to his account, so we need to round up to the nearest dollar. $71,443.88 rounded up to the nearest dollar is $71,444. Therefore, Peter needs to add $71,444 to his savings account to split the money evenly among his nine children. The correct answer is (D) $642,989. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: In a division sum, the divisor is ten times the quotient and five times the remainder. If the remainder is 38, the dividend is: Answer Choices: (A) 3648 (B) 3642 (C) 3636 (D) 3644 (E) 3864\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the quotient to be x. According to the problem, the divisor is ten times the quotient, which means the divisor is 10x. Also, the divisor is five times the remainder, which means the remainder is 10x/5 or 2x. Given that the remainder is 38, we can solve for x: 2x = 38 x = 19 Now that we know the quotient is 19, we can find the dividend by using the formula: Dividend = Divisor x Quotient + Remainder Dividend = 10x19 + 38 Dividend = 190 + 38 Dividend = 228 Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above, as none of the options match the calculated dividend of 228. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: When positive integer N is divided by positive integer J, the remainder is 18. If N/J = 134.08, what is value of J? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 56 (C) 78 (D) 112 (E) 225\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that N/J = 134.08. We also know that the remainder when N is divided by J is 18. This means that: N = J x 134.08 + 18 We want to find the value of J. We can start by simplifying the expression above: N = 134.08J + 18 We know that N and J are both positive integers, so we can rewrite this as: N = 134J + 8J + 18 Now we can see that 8J + 18 must be a multiple of J, since it is the remainder when N is divided by J. This means that J must be a factor of 8J + 18. We can write: 8J + 18 = J x k where k is some positive integer. Solving for J, we get: J = 18/(k-8) Since J is a positive integer, k-8 must be a factor of 18. The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. We can try each of these values for k and see which ones give us a positive integer value for J. For k=9, we get J = 18/(9-8) = 18, which is a positive integer. This is our answer. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 22. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The \u201clength of integer x\u201d refers to the number of prime factors, not necessarily distinct, that x has. (If x = 60, the length of x would be 4 because 60 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5.) What is the greatest possible length of integer z if z < 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 13 (B) 10 (C) 9 (D) 7 (E) 6\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We need to find the greatest possible length of an integer z if z < 1,000. The length of an integer refers to the number of prime factors it has, not necessarily distinct. So, we need to find an integer with the most prime factors that is less than 1,000. To do this, we can start with the smallest prime number, 2, and keep multiplying it by itself until we get a number greater than 1,000. 2^9 = 512, which is less than 1,000. 2^10 = 1,024, which is greater than 1,000. So, the greatest possible length of an integer z if z < 1,000 is 9. Therefore, the answer is (C) 9. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
