  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Pat, kate and mark charged a total of 198 hours to a certain project . If pat charged twice as much time to the project as kate and 1/3 as much times as mark, how many more hours did mark charge to the project than kate. Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 36 (C) 72 (D) 110 (E) 108\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that Kate charged x hours to the project. According to the problem, Pat charged twice as much time as Kate, so Pat charged 2x hours. Also, Pat charged 1/3 as much time as Mark, so Mark charged 3 times as much time as Pat, which is 6x hours. Therefore, the total time charged by all three is x + 2x + 6x = 9x. We know that the total time charged is 198 hours, so: 9x = 198 x = 22 So, Kate charged 22 hours, Pat charged 44 hours, and Mark charged 132 hours. The question asks how many more hours Mark charged than Kate, which is: 132 - 22 = 110 Therefore, the answer is (D) 110. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A certain restaurant offers 7 kinds of cheese and 2 kinds of fruit for its dessert platter. If each dessert platter contains an equal number of kinds of cheese and kinds of fruit, how many different dessert platters could the restaurant offer? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 12 (C) 15 (D) 21 (E) 35\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 7 kinds of cheese and 2 kinds of fruit. To have an equal number of kinds of cheese and fruit, we need to find the common factors of 7 and 2. The only common factor is 1. Therefore, each dessert platter can have only 1 kind of cheese and 1 kind of fruit. To find the total number of different dessert platters, we need to multiply the number of options for cheese and fruit. There are 7 options for cheese and 2 options for fruit. Therefore, the total number of different dessert platters is 7 x 2 = 14. However, we need to divide this number by 2 because the order of cheese and fruit does not matter. Therefore, the final answer is 14/2 = 7. So, the correct answer is (A) 8. None of the given options match the correct answer. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: If John takes 4 minutes to eat x raisins, how many seconds will it take him to eat z raisins, assuming he continues to eat at the same rate? Answer Choices: (A) 240z/x (B) 4xz (C) 240x/z (D) 240xz (E) 4z/x\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many raisins John can eat in one minute. We can do this by dividing x by 4 (since he eats x raisins in 4 minutes): x/4 Now we need to find out how many seconds it will take him to eat z raisins. We can set up a proportion: x/4 = z/t where t is the time it takes him to eat z raisins in seconds. We can solve for t: t = 4z/x Therefore, the answer is (E) 4z/x. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: We have 4 people and 1 chairs. In how many ways chairs can be occupy? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 86 (C) 24 (D) 14 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. If we have 4 people and only 1 chair, then only one person can sit on the chair at a time. So, we need to find the number of ways in which we can choose one person out of 4 to sit on the chair. The number of ways to choose one person out of 4 is 4. Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. None of the other options are correct as they are either too high or too low for the given scenario. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
