  "test_question": "Q: In how many ways can the letters of the word \"PROBLEC\" be rearranged to make 7 letter words such that none of the letters repeat? Answer Choices: (A) 2! (B) 3! (C) 7! (D) 8! (E) 9!",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Using all the letters of the word \"NOKIA\", how many words can be formed, which begin with N and end with A? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 24 (C) 62 (D) 78 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to choose the first letter as N, which leaves us with four letters: O, K, I, and A. Next, we need to arrange these four letters in different ways to form words. This can be done in 4! = 24 ways. Finally, we need to ensure that each word ends with A. Out of the four remaining letters, only one is A. Therefore, there is only one way to choose the last letter. So, the total number of words that can be formed is 24 x 1 = 24. Therefore, the answer is (B) 24. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Number of ways in which the letters of word PARDENS can be arranged with vowels in alphabetical order, is Answer Choices: (A) 360 (B) 240 (C) 2520 (D) 480 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to identify the vowels in the word PARDENS, which are A and E. Next, we need to arrange these vowels in alphabetical order, which can be done in only one way, i.e., AE. Now, we need to arrange the remaining consonants, i.e., P, R, D, N, and S. There are 5 consonants, so they can be arranged in 5! ways. Therefore, the total number of ways in which the letters of the word PARDENS can be arranged with vowels in alphabetical order is 1 x 5! = 120. None of the answer choices match this answer, so the correct answer is None of these. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: The letters B,G,I,NB,G,I,N and RR are rearranged to form the word 'Bring'. Find its probability: Answer Choices: (A) 1/120 (B) 1/(5) 4 (C) 1/24 (D) 1/76 (E) 1/32\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of ways to rearrange the letters in the word 'Bring'. This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is n!/(n-r)!. In this case, we have 5 letters, so there are 5!/(5-5)! = 5! = 120 ways to rearrange them. Next, we need to find the number of ways to rearrange the letters B, G, I, N, and R to form the word 'Bring'. We can do this by treating the letters as distinct objects and using the same formula as before. There are 5 letters, so there are 5!/(5-5)! = 5! = 120 ways to rearrange them. Therefore, the probability of rearranging the letters to form the word 'Bring' is the number of ways to rearrange the letters to form 'Bring' divided by the total number of ways to rearrange the letters. This is 1/120, which corresponds to answer choice (A). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Four different books (A, B, C and D) are to be arranged on a shelf. Books A and B are to be arranged first and second starting from the right of the shelf. The number of different orders in which books C and D may be arranged is Answer Choices: (A) 16! (B) 12! (C) 8! (D) 11! (E) 2!\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we arrange books A and B in 2! = 2 ways. Then, we have two remaining books, C and D, which can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways. Therefore, the total number of different orders in which the four books can be arranged is 2 x 2 = 4. None of the above answer choices match this result, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
