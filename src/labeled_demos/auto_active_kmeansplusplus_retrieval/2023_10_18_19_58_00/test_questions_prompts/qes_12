  "formatted_prompt": "Q: 5 and 15 are the first two terms in a geometric sequence. What is the arithmetic difference between the 9th term and the 7th term? Answer Choices: (A) 3*5^2 (B) 5* 3^13 - 5 * 3^11 (C) 40 * 3^7 (D) 40 * 3^10 (E) 3^12 - 3^10\nA: Let's think step by step. The first two terms of the geometric sequence are 5 and 15. We can find the common ratio by dividing the second term by the first term: r = 15/5 = 3 Now we can find the 9th term and the 7th term: a9 = 5 * 3^8 a7 = 5 * 3^6 To find the arithmetic difference between the 9th and 7th terms, we subtract a7 from a9: a9 - a7 = 5 * 3^8 - 5 * 3^6 We can factor out 5 * 3^6: a9 - a7 = 5 * 3^6 (3^2 - 1) Simplifying, we get: a9 - a7 = 5 * 3^6 * 8 Therefore, the answer is (C) 40 * 3^7. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: 1397 x 1397 = ? Answer Choices: (A) 1961609 (B) 1851609 (C) 1951619 (D) 1951609 (E) 1851619\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the formula (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 to solve this problem. In this case, a = 1397 and b = 1397. So, (1397 + 1397)^2 = 1397^2 + 2(1397)(1397) + 1397^2 Simplifying this expression, we get: = 1951609 Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 1951609. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If the average (arithmetic mean) of x + 1, x + 3, and x + 5 is 0, then x = Answer Choices: (A) \u20134 (B) \u20133 (C) \u20132 (D) \u20131 (E) 0\nA: Let's think step by step. The average of x + 1, x + 3, and x + 5 is (x + 1 + x + 3 + x + 5)/3 = (3x + 9)/3 = x + 3. We know that the average is 0, so x + 3 = 0. Solving for x, we get x = -3. Therefore, the answer is (B) -3. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: How many of the positive factors of 19 are not factors of 29? Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 2 (D) 3 (E) 4\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We need to find the positive factors of 19. The factors of 19 are 1 and 19. Now, we need to check which of these factors are not factors of 29. The factors of 29 are 1 and 29. So, the only factor of 19 that is not a factor of 29 is 19 itself. Therefore, the answer is (B) 1. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
