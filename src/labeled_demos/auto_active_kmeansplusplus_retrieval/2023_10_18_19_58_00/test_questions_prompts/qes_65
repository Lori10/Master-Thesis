  "test_question": "Q: The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other? Answer Choices: (A) 242 (B) 308 (C) 352 (D) 412 (E) 456",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If the LCM of 9, 7, 2, and q is 504, which of the following could be q? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 6 (D) 9 (E) 5\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the prime factorization of 504: 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7 Next, we need to make sure that q is a factor of 504. Since 504 is divisible by 9, 7, and 2, q must also be a factor of 504. Option A: 7 is already a factor of 504, so it could be q. Option B: 8 is not a factor of 504. Option C: 6 is a factor of 504, but it is not the least common multiple of 9, 7, and 2. Option D: 9 is already a factor of 504, so it could be q. Option E: 5 is not a factor of 504. Therefore, the possible values of q are 7 and 9. Answer: (A) 7 or (D) 9. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Adding two non multiples of E always results in a multiple of E; which of the following must be the value of E ? Answer Choices: (A) [A] two (B) [B] three (C) [C] five (D) [D] ten (E) [E] hundred\nA: Let's think step by step. If adding two non-multiples of E always results in a multiple of E, then E must be a common factor of those two numbers. Let's try each option and see if it works: (A) Two: Adding two non-multiples of 2 always results in an even number, which is a multiple of 2. This option could be correct. (B) Three: Adding two non-multiples of 3 does not always result in a multiple of 3. For example, 1 + 5 = 6, which is a multiple of 3, but 1 and 5 are both non-multiples of 3. This option is not correct. (C) Five: Adding two non-multiples of 5 always results in a multiple of 5. This option could be correct. (D) Ten: Adding two non-multiples of 10 always results in a multiple of 10. This option could be correct. (E) Hundred: Adding two non-multiples of 100 always results in a multiple of 100. This option could be correct. Therefore, the correct answer is either (A) two, (C) five, (D) ten, or (E) hundred. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: If y is the smallest positive integer such that 6300 multiplied by y is the square of an integer, then y must be Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 7 (C) 15 (D) 35 (E) 45\nA: Let's think step by step. We need to find the smallest positive integer y such that 6300 multiplied by y is the square of an integer. Let's factor 6300: 6300 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2 * 7 To be a perfect square, each prime factor must have an even exponent. Therefore, we need to add one factor of 7 to make the exponent of 7 even. So, y = 7. Therefore, the answer is (B) 7. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: The \u201clength of integer x\u201d refers to the number of prime factors, not necessarily distinct, that x has. (If x = 60, the length of x would be 4 because 60 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5.) What is the greatest possible length of integer z if z < 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 13 (B) 10 (C) 9 (D) 7 (E) 6\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We need to find the greatest possible length of an integer z if z < 1,000. The length of an integer refers to the number of prime factors it has, not necessarily distinct. So, we need to find an integer with the most prime factors that is less than 1,000. To do this, we can start with the smallest prime number, 2, and keep multiplying it by itself until we get a number greater than 1,000. 2^9 = 512, which is less than 1,000. 2^10 = 1,024, which is greater than 1,000. So, the greatest possible length of an integer z if z < 1,000 is 9. Therefore, the answer is (C) 9. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
