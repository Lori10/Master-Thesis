  "test_question": "Q: At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle? Answer Choices: (A) 50 m (B) 75 m (C) 100 m (D) 125 m (E) 150 m",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A train 700 m long is running at a speed of 78 km/hr. If it crosses a tunnel in 1 min, then the length of the tunnel is? Answer Choices: (A) 298 m (B) 468 m (C) 600 m (D) 667 m (E) 781 m\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s. 78 km/hr = (78 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 21.67 m/s Next, we need to find the time taken by the train to cross the tunnel. We know that the length of the train is 700 m and it crosses the tunnel in 1 min (60 seconds). Therefore, the speed of the train relative to the tunnel is: Speed = Distance / Time Speed = (700 + Length of tunnel) / 60 Speed = (700 + Length of tunnel) / 60 Multiplying both sides by 60: Speed x 60 = 700 + Length of tunnel 21.67 x 60 = 700 + Length of tunnel 1300.2 - 700 = Length of tunnel Length of tunnel = 600.2 m Therefore, the length of the tunnel is approximately 600 m. The closest answer choice is (C) 600 m. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: What would happen in the previous question if both A and B had started at point P. Answer Choices: (A) 800 Km (B) 600 Km (C) 1000 Km (D) 350 Km (E) 250 Km\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that A travels at a speed of 50 km/h and B travels at a speed of 40 km/h. If they both started at point P, they would be moving in opposite directions. Let's say they meet after x hours. In that time, A would have traveled 50x km and B would have traveled 40x km. We also know that the distance between A and B is 600 km. So, we can set up the equation: 50x + 40x = 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 90x = 600 x = 6.67 hours Now that we know they meet after 6.67 hours, we can find out how far each of them has traveled: A: 50 km/h x 6.67 h = 333.33 km B: 40 km/h x 6.67 h = 266.67 km The total distance they have traveled is: 333.33 km + 266.67 km = 600 km Therefore, the answer is (B) 600 km. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: The diameter of the driving wheel of a bus is 120 m. How many revolution, per minute must the wheel make in order to keep a speed of 60 kmph approximately Answer Choices: (A) 245 (B) 257 (C) 262 (D) 265 (E) 275\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed from km/h to m/min. 60 km/h = 60,000 m/h = 1,000 m/min Next, we need to find the circumference of the wheel using the formula: Circumference = \u03c0 \u00d7 diameter Circumference = \u03c0 \u00d7 120 m Circumference \u2248 376.99 m Finally, we can use the formula: Speed = circumference \u00d7 revolutions per minute 1,000 m/min = 376.99 m \u00d7 revolutions per minute Revolutions per minute \u2248 2.65 Therefore, the answer is (D) 265. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Two trains of equal lengths take 10 sec and 15 sec respectively to cross a telegraph post. If the length of each train be 120 m, in what time will they cross other travelling in opposite direction? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 12 (C) 13 (D) 14 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. The total distance covered by both trains when they cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is 240 meters. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds, since they are travelling in opposite directions. Let's call this speed \"v\". We know that the first train takes 10 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/10 = 12 m/s. Similarly, the second train takes 15 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/15 = 8 m/s. Therefore, the relative speed of the two trains is v = 12 + 8 = 20 m/s. To find the time it takes for the two trains to cross each other, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed Plugging in the values we know, we get: time = 240 / 20 = 12 seconds Therefore, the answer is (B) 12. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
