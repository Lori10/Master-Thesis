  "test_question": "Q: If one third of 3/4 of a number is 21. Then, find the number? Answer Choices: (A) 84 (B) 66 (C) 28 (D) 19 (E) 11",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Seventy five percent of a number is 21 less than four fifth of that number. What is the number ? Answer Choices: (A) 240 (B) 340 (C) 420 (D) 130 (E) 125\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the number to be 'x'. According to the problem, 75% of the number is 21 less than 4/5 of the number. Translating this into an equation: 0.75x = (4/5)x - 21 Simplifying this equation: 0.75x - (4/5)x = -21 (15/20)x - (16/20)x = -21 (-1/20)x = -21 x = (-21) * (-20) x = 420 Therefore, the answer is (C) 420. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Which number should replace both the asterisks in (* /21) x (*/84) = 1 ? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 42 (C) 63 (D) 72 (E) 168\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that (* /21) x (*/84) = 1. Let's start by finding the missing number in the first set of parentheses. We know that when we divide any number by itself, the result is always 1. So, we can assume that the missing number in the first set of parentheses is 21, since 21 divided by 21 is 1. Now we have (21/21) x (*/84) = 1. To solve for the missing number in the second set of parentheses, we can use algebra. Let's call the missing number \"x\". So, we have (21/21) x (x/84) = 1. Simplifying this equation, we get: x/84 = 1 Multiplying both sides by 84, we get: x = 84 Therefore, the missing number in the second set of parentheses is 84. So, the answer is (E) 168. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: We have 4 people and 1 chairs. In how many ways chairs can be occupy? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 86 (C) 24 (D) 14 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. If we have 4 people and only 1 chair, then only one person can sit on the chair at a time. So, we need to find the number of ways in which we can choose one person out of 4 to sit on the chair. The number of ways to choose one person out of 4 is 4. Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. None of the other options are correct as they are either too high or too low for the given scenario. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Peter rolls two dice at the same time. What is the probability that the total sum of numbers on the dices is 3? Answer Choices: (A) a)  1/12 (B) b)  1/36 (C) c)  1/6 (D) d)  1/18 (E) e)  1/3\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice, as each die has 6 possible outcomes. To get a sum of 3, the only possible outcomes are (1,2) and (2,1). Therefore, there are only 2 favorable outcomes out of 36 possible outcomes. So, the probability of getting a sum of 3 is 2/36, which simplifies to 1/18. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) d) 1/18. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
