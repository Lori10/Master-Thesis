  "test_question": "Q: A rectangle has a length of 8 centimeters and a width of 3 centimeters. Find the perimeter. Answer Choices: (A) 18cm (B) 22cm (C) 20cm (D) 30cm (E) 28cm",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A man cycles round the boundary of a rectangular park at the rate of 12 kmph and completes one full round in 8 minutes. If the ratio between the length and breadth of the park be 3:2, then its area is: Answer Choices: (A) 1536m2 (B) 15360m2 (C) 153600m2 (D) 163600m2 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular park. Let the length and breadth of the park be 3x and 2x respectively (as given in the ratio 3:2). Perimeter of the park = 2(Length + Breadth) = 2(3x + 2x) = 10x Now, we know that the man cycles round the park at the rate of 12 kmph. In 1 hour, he covers a distance of 12 km. In 1 minute, he covers a distance of 12/60 = 0.2 km = 200 m. In 8 minutes, he covers a distance of 200 x 8 = 1600 m = 1.6 km. We also know that in 8 minutes, he completes one full round of the park. Therefore, 10x = 1.6 km x = 160 m Length of the park = 3x = 480 m Breadth of the park = 2x = 320 m Area of the park = Length x Breadth = 480 x 320 = 153600 m\u00b2 Hence, the correct answer is (C) 153600m\u00b2. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The area of a square is 4225 sq cm. Find the ratio of the breadth and the length of a rectangle whose length is twice the side of the square and breadth is 24 cm less than the side of the square. Answer Choices: (A) 5:28 (B) 5:19 (C) 5:12 (D) 5:13 (E) 41:130\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the side of the square. We know that the area of the square is 4225 sq cm, so we can find the side by taking the square root of the area: Side of square = \u221a4225 = 65 cm Next, we need to find the length and breadth of the rectangle. We are given that the length is twice the side of the square, so: Length of rectangle = 2 x 65 = 130 cm We are also given that the breadth is 24 cm less than the side of the square, so: Breadth of rectangle = 65 - 24 = 41 cm Now, we need to find the ratio of the breadth and the length of the rectangle. Ratio of breadth to length = 41:130 Simplifying this ratio by dividing both sides by 41, we get: 1:3.17 Multiplying both sides by 5 to get rid of the decimal, we get: 5:15.83 Rounding off to the nearest whole number, we get: 5:16 Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A HEXAGON IS FORMED ABCDEF WHICH PERIMETER 36cm. A POLYGON IS FORMED BY JOINING THE POINTS AE &BD . FIND THE AREA OF THE POLYGON ABDE? Answer Choices: (A) 34\u221a3 cm2 (B) 35\u221a3 cm2 (C) 36\u221a3 cm2 (D) 37\u221a3 cm2 (E) 38\u221a3 cm2\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length of each side of the hexagon. Since the perimeter is 36cm and there are six sides, each side has a length of 6cm. Next, we need to find the area of triangle ABE. We can use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is 1/2 * base * height. The base is AB, which has a length of 6cm. To find the height, we need to draw a perpendicular line from E to AB. Let's call the point where the perpendicular line intersects AB point G. Triangle AEG is a 30-60-90 triangle, so the height EG is 3\u221a3 cm. Therefore, the area of triangle ABE is 1/2 * 6cm * 3\u221a3 cm = 9\u221a3 cm2. We can use the same method to find the area of triangle BDE. The base is BD, which also has a length of 6cm. To find the height, we need to draw a perpendicular line from D to BD. Let's call the point where the perpendicular line intersects BD point H. Triangle BDH is also a 30-60-90 triangle, so the height DH is 3\u221a3 cm. Therefore, the area of triangle BDE is 1/2 * 6cm * 3\u221a3 cm = 9\u221a3 cm2. Finally, we can find the area of the polygon ABDE by adding the areas of triangles ABE and BDE. 9\u221a3 cm2 + 9\u221a3 cm2 = 18\u221a3 cm2. Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) since none of the given answer choices match our calculated answer of 18\u221a3 cm2. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: The length of a rectangular plot is 20 metres more than its breadth. If the cost of fencing the plot @ Rs. 26.50 per metre is Rs. 7420, what is the length of the plot in metres? Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 200 (C) 300 (D) 400 (E) 80\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the breadth of the rectangular plot be x metres. Then, the length of the plot is (x+20) metres. The cost of fencing the plot is Rs. 26.50 per metre. Therefore, the total cost of fencing the rectangular plot is: Perimeter of the plot x Cost per metre = (2 x length + 2 x breadth) x 26.50 Substituting the values of length and breadth, we get: (2(x+20) + 2x) x 26.50 = 7420 Simplifying the equation, we get: 6.5x + 530 = 371 6.5x = 371 - 530 6.5x = -159 x = -24.46 Since the breadth cannot be negative, this answer is not possible. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
