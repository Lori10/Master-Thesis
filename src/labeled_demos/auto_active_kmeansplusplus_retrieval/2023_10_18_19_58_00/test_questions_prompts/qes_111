  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If a 10% deposit amounting to $110 has been paid toward buying a brand new TV, how much remains to be paid? Answer Choices: (A) $880 (B) $990 (C) $1000 (D) $1100 (E) $1210\nA: Let's think step by step. The deposit amount is 10% of the total cost of the TV. Let's represent the total cost as \"x\". So, we can write the equation: 10% of x = $110 0.1x = $110 Solving for x: x = $1100 Therefore, the total cost of the TV is $1100. To find out how much remains to be paid, we need to subtract the deposit amount from the total cost: $1100 - $110 = $990 So, the answer is (B) $990. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A camera lens filter kit containing 5 filters sells for $52.50. If the filters are purchased individually, 2 of them are priced at $6.45 each, 2 at $11.05 each, 1 at $15.50. The amount saved by purchasing the kit is what percent of the total price of the 5 filters purchased individually? Answer Choices: (A) 3.76% (B) 4.76% (C) 5.76% (D) 6.76% (E) 7.76%\nA: Let's think step by step. The total cost of purchasing the filters individually is: 2 x $6.45 + 2 x $11.05 + $15.50 = $31.50 The cost of purchasing the kit is $52.50. The amount saved by purchasing the kit is: $31.50 - $52.50 = -$21.00 This means that purchasing the kit costs $21.00 more than purchasing the filters individually. To find the percentage of the total price saved by purchasing the kit, we need to divide the amount saved by the total cost of purchasing the filters individually and then multiply by 100: (-$21.00 / $31.50) x 100 = -66.67% This means that purchasing the kit costs 66.67% more than purchasing the filters individually. However, the question asks for the percentage of the total price saved, not the percentage of the total price increased. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: A, B and C rent a pasture. A puts 10 oxen for 7 months, B puts 12 oxen for 5 months and C puts 15 oxen for 3 months for grazing. If the rent of the pasture is Rs. 245, how much must C pay as his share of rent? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 50 (C) 55 (D) 63 (E) none\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of oxen-months contributed by all three people. A contributed 10 oxen for 7 months, so that's 10 x 7 = 70 oxen-months. B contributed 12 oxen for 5 months, so that's 12 x 5 = 60 oxen-months. C contributed 15 oxen for 3 months, so that's 15 x 3 = 45 oxen-months. The total number of oxen-months is 70 + 60 + 45 = 175. Now we need to find out what fraction of the total rent C should pay. C contributed 45 oxen-months out of a total of 175, which is 45/175. To find out how much C should pay, we need to multiply this fraction by the total rent: (45/175) x 245 = 63 So C should pay Rs. 63 as his share of the rent. The correct answer is (D) 63. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: The no.of seats in a cinema hall is decreased by 5%, the price on the ticket also 5%. What is the effect on the revenue collected..?? Answer Choices: (A) -10% (B) +2.5% (C) -9.75% (D) +10.5% (E) +11.5%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the original number of seats in the cinema hall is 100 and the original price of a ticket is $10. After the decrease of 5%, the new number of seats will be 95 (100 - 5% of 100) and the new price of a ticket will be $9.50 (10 - 5% of 10). Therefore, the new revenue collected can be calculated as follows: New revenue = New number of seats x New price of a ticket New revenue = 95 x 9.50 New revenue = $902.50 Now, let's compare the new revenue with the original revenue: Original revenue = Original number of seats x Original price of a ticket Original revenue = 100 x 10 Original revenue = $1000 The percentage decrease in revenue can be calculated as follows: Percentage decrease = (Original revenue - New revenue) / Original revenue x 100% Percentage decrease = (1000 - 902.50) / 1000 x 100% Percentage decrease = 9.75% Therefore, the answer is (C) -9.75%. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
