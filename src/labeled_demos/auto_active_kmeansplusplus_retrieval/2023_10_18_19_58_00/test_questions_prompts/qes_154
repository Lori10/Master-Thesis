  "test_question": "Q: The average weight of 10 oarsmen in a boat is increased by 1.8 kg when one of the crew, who weighs 53 kg is replaced by a new man. Find the weight of the new man. Answer Choices: (A) 71 (B) 62 (C) 43 (D) 67 (E) 40",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A boat having a length 3 m and breadth 2 m is floating on a lake. The boat sinks by 1.2 cm when a man gets on it. The mass of man is Answer Choices: (A) 72 kg (B) 60 kg (C) 72 kg (D) 96 kg (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the volume of water displaced by the boat before the man gets on it. Volume of water displaced = length x breadth x height of displacement = 3m x 2m x 0.012m (1.2 cm converted to meters) = 0.072 cubic meters Now, when the man gets on the boat, the boat sinks by 1.2 cm more. So, the new height of displacement is 0.024m (0.012m + 0.012m). Let's assume the density of water is 1000 kg/m^3. The weight of water displaced by the boat before the man gets on it = volume of water displaced x density of water = 0.072m^3 x 1000 kg/m^3 = 72 kg The weight of water displaced by the boat after the man gets on it = (volume of water displaced + additional displacement due to the man) x density of water = (3m x 2m x 0.024m) x 1000 kg/m^3 = 1.44 kg Therefore, the weight of the man = weight of water displaced before the man gets on the boat - weight of water displaced after the man gets on the boat = 72 kg - 1.44 kg = 70.56 kg So, the answer is (E) None of the above. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: The average weight of a group of boys is 30 kg. After a boy of weight 39 kg joins the group, the average weight of the group goes up by 1 kg. Find the number of boys in the group originally ? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 5 (D) 2 (E) 9\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the original number of boys in the group be x and their total weight be y. According to the problem, the average weight of the group of boys is 30 kg. Therefore, we can write: y/x = 30 After a boy of weight 39 kg joins the group, the average weight of the group goes up by 1 kg. This means that the new average weight is 31 kg. Therefore, we can write: (y + 39)/(x + 1) = 31 Now we have two equations with two variables. We can solve for x by using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution: y/x = 30 y = 30x Substitute y = 30x into the second equation: (30x + 39)/(x + 1) = 31 Simplify: 30x + 39 = 31(x + 1) 30x + 39 = 31x + 31 x = 8 Therefore, the original number of boys in the group is 8. The answer is (B) 8. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: You have been given a physical balance and 7 weights of 43, 45, 30, 33, 28, 37 and 55 kgs. Keeping weights on one pan and object on the other, what is the maximum you can weigh less than 145 kgs. Answer Choices: (A) 145 (B) 143 (C) 147 (D) 141 (E) 142\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the combination of weights that adds up to the maximum weight less than 145 kgs. Starting with the heaviest weight, we can add 55 kgs to the pan. Next, we can add 45 kgs to the same pan, bringing the total weight to 100 kgs. Adding the next heaviest weight, 43 kgs, would bring the total weight to 143 kgs, which is less than 145 kgs. Therefore, the maximum weight we can weigh less than 145 kgs is 143 kgs. The correct answer is (B) 143. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In a weight-lifting competition, the total weight of Joe's two lifts was 450 pounds. If twice the weight of his first lift was 300 pounds more than the weight of his second lift, what was the weight, in pounds, of his first lift? Answer Choices: (A) 250 (B) 275 (C) 325 (D) 350 (E) 400\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the weight of Joe's first lift as 'x' pounds. According to the problem, the total weight of Joe's two lifts was 450 pounds. So, the weight of his second lift can be represented as (450 - x) pounds. Now, the problem also states that twice the weight of his first lift was 300 pounds more than the weight of his second lift. Mathematically, we can represent this as: 2x = (450 - x) + 300 Simplifying this equation, we get: 3x = 750 x = 250 Therefore, the weight of Joe's first lift was 250 pounds. Hence, the answer is (A) 250. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
