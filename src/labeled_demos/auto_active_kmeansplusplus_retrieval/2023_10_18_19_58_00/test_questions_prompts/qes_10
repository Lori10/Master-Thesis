  "formatted_prompt": "Q: How many 4-digit Q numbers (ABCD) can be formed such that |A \u2013 D| = 2? Answer Choices: (A) 2,000 (B) 1,900 (C) 1,800 (D) 1,600 (E) 1,500\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that |A \u2013 D| = 2. This means that A and D are either 2 digits apart or 2 digits away from each other in the number line. Case 1: A is 2 digits greater than D. In this case, we can choose any digit from 1 to 9 for D (since it's a 4-digit number, we can't have 0 as the first digit). Then, A can be any digit that is 2 greater than D, except for 9 (since we can't have a 5th digit). So, there are 8 choices for A. Case 2: D is 2 digits greater than A. This is the same as Case 1, but with A and D switched. So, there are also 8 choices for A in this case. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit Q numbers that can be formed is 8 + 8 = 16. The answer is (D) 1,600. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Adding two non multiples of E always results in a multiple of E; which of the following must be the value of E ? Answer Choices: (A) [A] two (B) [B] three (C) [C] five (D) [D] ten (E) [E] hundred\nA: Let's think step by step. If adding two non-multiples of E always results in a multiple of E, then E must be a common factor of those two numbers. Let's try each option and see if it works: (A) Two: Adding two non-multiples of 2 always results in an even number, which is a multiple of 2. This option could be correct. (B) Three: Adding two non-multiples of 3 does not always result in a multiple of 3. For example, 1 + 5 = 6, which is a multiple of 3, but 1 and 5 are both non-multiples of 3. This option is not correct. (C) Five: Adding two non-multiples of 5 always results in a multiple of 5. This option could be correct. (D) Ten: Adding two non-multiples of 10 always results in a multiple of 10. This option could be correct. (E) Hundred: Adding two non-multiples of 100 always results in a multiple of 100. This option could be correct. Therefore, the correct answer is either (A) two, (C) five, (D) ten, or (E) hundred. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In a division sum, the divisor is ten times the quotient and five times the remainder. If the remainder is 38, the dividend is: Answer Choices: (A) 3648 (B) 3642 (C) 3636 (D) 3644 (E) 3864\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the quotient to be x. According to the problem, the divisor is ten times the quotient, which means the divisor is 10x. Also, the divisor is five times the remainder, which means the remainder is 10x/5 or 2x. Given that the remainder is 38, we can solve for x: 2x = 38 x = 19 Now that we know the quotient is 19, we can find the dividend by using the formula: Dividend = Divisor x Quotient + Remainder Dividend = 10x19 + 38 Dividend = 190 + 38 Dividend = 228 Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above, as none of the options match the calculated dividend of 228. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: you need to pict any number from 1, 3,5,7,9,11,13 and 15 to make below equation true.\n()+()+()=30\ncan you solve it? Answer Choices: (A) 7+15+9 (B) 6+15+9 (C) 6+14+9 (D) 6+15+8 (E) 8+15+9\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find three odd numbers that add up to 30. The sum of three odd numbers is always an odd number. Therefore, we can eliminate options (B) and (D) since they have an even number in them. Next, we can eliminate option (C) since the sum of 6, 14, and 9 is 29, not 30. Now, we are left with options (A) and (E). We can check both options to see which one adds up to 30. Option (A): 7 + 15 + 9 = 31, not 30. Option (E): 8 + 15 + 9 = 32, not 30. Therefore, none of the given options are correct. The answer is \"None of the above\". The answer is E.\n\n\n"
