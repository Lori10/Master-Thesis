  "test_question": "Q: I know a 5 digit number having a property that with a 1 after it, it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it.\nWhat is that number? Answer Choices: (A) 42857 (B) 32456 (C) 76523 (D) 24567 (E) 43566",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: How many 4-digit Q numbers (ABCD) can be formed such that |A \u2013 D| = 2? Answer Choices: (A) 2,000 (B) 1,900 (C) 1,800 (D) 1,600 (E) 1,500\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that |A \u2013 D| = 2. This means that A and D are either 2 digits apart or 2 digits away from each other in the number line. Case 1: A is 2 digits greater than D. In this case, we can choose any digit from 1 to 9 for D (since it's a 4-digit number, we can't have 0 as the first digit). Then, A can be any digit that is 2 greater than D, except for 9 (since we can't have a 5th digit). So, there are 8 choices for A. Case 2: D is 2 digits greater than A. This is the same as Case 1, but with A and D switched. So, there are also 8 choices for A in this case. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit Q numbers that can be formed is 8 + 8 = 16. The answer is (D) 1,600. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Find the odd man out. 187, 264, 316, 473, 682, 781 Answer Choices: (A) 187 (B) 316 (C) 781 (D) 682 (E) 473\nA: Let's think step by step. The numbers seem random, so we need to find a pattern or rule that applies to all except one of the numbers. If we look at the last digit of each number, we can see that they alternate between odd and even: 7, 4, 6, 3, 2, 1. However, this pattern doesn't apply to 316, which ends in an even digit. Therefore, the odd man out is (B) 316. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: The \u201clength of integer x\u201d refers to the number of prime factors, not necessarily distinct, that x has. (If x = 60, the length of x would be 4 because 60 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5.) What is the greatest possible length of integer z if z < 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 13 (B) 10 (C) 9 (D) 7 (E) 6\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We need to find the greatest possible length of an integer z if z < 1,000. The length of an integer refers to the number of prime factors it has, not necessarily distinct. So, we need to find an integer with the most prime factors that is less than 1,000. To do this, we can start with the smallest prime number, 2, and keep multiplying it by itself until we get a number greater than 1,000. 2^9 = 512, which is less than 1,000. 2^10 = 1,024, which is greater than 1,000. So, the greatest possible length of an integer z if z < 1,000 is 9. Therefore, the answer is (C) 9. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: How Many 7\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are there in the following sequence which are immediately preceded by 6 but not immediately followed by 4?\n6 7 4 2 7 4 9 3 6 7 1 9 4 7 2 9 6 7 1 3 6 7 4 3 6 Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Identify all the 7's in the sequence: 6 7 4 2 7 4 9 3 6 7 1 9 4 7 2 9 6 7 1 3 6 7 4 3 6 Step 2: Check if each 7 is immediately preceded by 6 and not immediately followed by 4. Step 3: We find that there are only two 7's that meet this condition: 6 7 1 3 6 and 6 7 4 3 6. Therefore, the answer is (B) 2. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
