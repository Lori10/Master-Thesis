  "test_question": "Q: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? Answer Choices: (A) 277 (B) 288 (C) 200 (D) 277 (E) 168",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The average age of students of a class is 15.8 years. The average age of boys in the class is 16.4 years and that of the girls is 15.4 years. The ration of the number of boys to the number of girls in the class is: Answer Choices: (A) 2:5 (B) 2:3 (C) 2:4 (D) 2:1 (E) 2:9\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the number of boys in the class be 'b' and the number of girls be 'g'. We know that the average age of the class is 15.8 years. So, the total age of all the students in the class = 15.8 x (b+g) We also know that the average age of boys in the class is 16.4 years. So, the total age of all the boys in the class = 16.4 x b Similarly, the total age of all the girls in the class = 15.4 x g Now, we can form an equation using the above information: (16.4 x b + 15.4 x g) / (b+g) = 15.8 Simplifying this equation, we get: 16.4b + 15.4g = 15.8b + 15.8g 0.6b = 0.4g b/g = 2/3 Therefore, the ratio of the number of boys to the number of girls in the class is 2:3. Hence, the correct answer is option (B) 2:3. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: We have 4 people and 1 chairs. In how many ways chairs can be occupy? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 86 (C) 24 (D) 14 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. If we have 4 people and only 1 chair, then only one person can sit on the chair at a time. So, we need to find the number of ways in which we can choose one person out of 4 to sit on the chair. The number of ways to choose one person out of 4 is 4. Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. None of the other options are correct as they are either too high or too low for the given scenario. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: There are 600 boys in a hostel. Each plays either hockey or football or both. If 75% play hockey and 45% play football, how many play both? Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 150 (C) 200 (D) 180 (E) 160\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 75% of the boys play hockey, which means 0.75 x 600 = 450 boys play hockey. Similarly, 45% of the boys play football, which means 0.45 x 600 = 270 boys play football. Now, we need to find out how many boys play both hockey and football. Let's assume that x boys play both. We know that the total number of boys who play either hockey or football is 600. So, we can write an equation: Number of boys who play hockey + Number of boys who play football - Number of boys who play both = Total number of boys 450 + 270 - x = 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 720 - x = 600 x = 120 Therefore, 120 boys play both hockey and football. The correct answer is (A) 120. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A group of 55 adults and 70 children go for trekking. If there is meal for either 70 adults or 90 children and if 28 adults have their meal, find the total number of children that can be catered with the remaining food. Answer Choices: (A) 42 (B) 54 (C) 90 (D) 70 (E) 80\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that there are 55 adults and 70 children, so the total number of people is 55 + 70 = 125. Step 2: We also know that there is enough food for either 70 adults or 90 children. Since there are only 55 adults, we can assume that the remaining food is for the children. Step 3: 28 adults have already had their meal, so the number of adults left is 55 - 28 = 27. Step 4: We need to find out how many children can be catered with the remaining food. Since the remaining food is for either 70 adults or 90 children, we can set up a proportion: 70 adults = 90 children 1 adult = 90/70 children 27 adults = (90/70) x 27 children 27 adults = 34.29 children (rounded to two decimal places) Step 5: Since we can't have a fraction of a child, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the total number of children that can be catered with the remaining food is 35. Answer: None of the above (the closest option is A, but it is not the correct answer). The answer is A.\n\n\n"
