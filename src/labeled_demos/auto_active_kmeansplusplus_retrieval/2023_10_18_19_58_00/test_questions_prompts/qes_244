  "formatted_prompt": "Q: At 6'o clock clock ticks 6 times. The time between first and\nlast ticks was 30sec. How much time it takes at 12'o clock. Answer Choices: (A) 60sec (B) 62sec (C) 66sec (D) 64sec (E) 76sec\nA: Let's think step by step. At 6'o clock, the clock ticks 6 times, which means that each tick is 1/6th of a full rotation. The time between the first and last ticks is 30 seconds, and there are 5 intervals between the 6 ticks. Therefore, each interval is 30/5 = 6 seconds. At 12'o clock, the clock ticks 12 times, which means that each tick is 1/12th of a full rotation. Using the same logic as before, the time between the first and last ticks at 12'o clock would be 11 intervals of 1/12th of a rotation, which is 11/12ths of a full rotation. So, the time it takes between the first and last ticks at 12'o clock would be (11/12) * 60 seconds = 55 seconds. None of the answer choices match this result, so the answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Three friends-whose walking rates are 1 ft./sec., 3ft./sec.,and 6ft./sec. start together walking in the same direction around a circular track that is 420 feet in circumference.After how many minutes are the three of them together again? Answer Choices: (A) 5 mins (B) 10 mins (C) 15 mins (D) 3 mins (E) 7 mins\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for each friend to complete one full lap around the track. We can use the formula: time = distance / rate For the friend with a walking rate of 1 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 1 ft./sec. = 420 sec. For the friend with a walking rate of 3 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 3 ft./sec. = 140 sec. For the friend with a walking rate of 6 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 6 ft./sec. = 70 sec. Now we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these three times, which will give us the time it takes for all three friends to be together again. The LCM of 420 sec., 140 sec., and 70 sec. is 420 sec. Converting 420 sec. to minutes, we get: 420 sec. / 60 sec./min. = 7 min. Therefore, the answer is (E) 7 mins. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In a game of billiards, A can give B 20 points in 60 and he can give C 30 points in 60. How many points can B give C in a game of 120? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 77 (C) 45 (D) 18 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many points A can give B in a game of 120. We can use the ratio of 20 points in 60 to find out how many points A can give B in 120. 20 points in 60 minutes is equivalent to (20/60) = 1/3 points per minute. Therefore, in 120 minutes, A can give B (1/3 x 120) = 40 points. Now, we need to find out how many points A can give C in a game of 120. Using the same method as above, we get: 30 points in 60 minutes is equivalent to (30/60) = 1/2 points per minute. Therefore, in 120 minutes, A can give C (1/2 x 120) = 60 points. Now, we need to find out how many points B can give C in a game of 120. Let's assume that B can give C x points in 120 minutes. In 120 minutes, A can give B 40 points and A can give C 60 points. Therefore, B can give C (60 - 40) = 20 points in 120 minutes. Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match our calculation. The correct answer is 20. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: At what time between 7 and 8 o\u2019clock will the hands of a clock be in the same straight line but, not together? Answer Choices: (A) 5 min. past 7 (B) 5 2\u204411 min. past 7 (C) 5 3\u204411 min. past 7 (D) 5 5\u204411 min. past 7 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. The hour hand moves 30 degrees in one hour (360 degrees divided by 12 hours) and 0.5 degrees in one minute (30 degrees divided by 60 minutes). The minute hand moves 6 degrees in one minute (360 degrees divided by 60 minutes). Let's assume that x minutes have passed since 7 o'clock. The angle between the hour and minute hand is given by: |0.5x - 30h|, where h is the hour hand position in degrees. At 7 o'clock, the hour hand is at 210 degrees (7 hours times 30 degrees). Substituting this value, we get: |0.5x - 210| - 6x = 0 Solving for x, we get: 0.5x - 210 = 6x or 0.5x - 210 = -6x Solving for x in both cases, we get: x = 252/11 or x = 210/11 The first solution corresponds to 5 7/11 minutes past 7 and the second solution corresponds to 5 2/11 minutes past 7. Therefore, the answer is (B) 5 2/11 min. past 7. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
