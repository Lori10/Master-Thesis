  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Gautami went to the stationers and bought things worth Rs. 100, out of which 50 paise went on sales tax on taxable purchases. If the tax rate was 5%. then what was the cost of the tax free items? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 99.50 (B) Rs. 70.50 (C) Rs. 89.50 (D) Rs. 69.50 (E) Rs. 80.50\nA: Let's think step by step. The total cost of the items including tax is Rs. 100. Out of this, 50 paise (or Rs. 0.50) went on sales tax. We know that the tax rate is 5%. So, we can set up an equation: 5% of the taxable purchases = Rs. 0.50 To find the cost of tax-free items, we need to subtract the tax amount from the total cost: Cost of tax-free items = Total cost - Tax amount Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 100 - Rs. 0.50 Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 99.50 Therefore, the answer is (A) Rs. 99.50. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: When sold at a 60% discount, a sweater nets the merchant a 20% profit on the wholesale cost at which he initially purchased the item. By what % is the sweater marked up from wholesale at its normal retail price? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 66.67% (D) 80% (E) 100%\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that the wholesale cost of the sweater is $100. If the merchant sells the sweater at a 60% discount, he sells it for 40% of the original price, which is $40. Now, we know that the merchant makes a 20% profit on the wholesale cost at which he initially purchased the item. So, the cost price for the merchant is $100, and he makes a profit of 20%, which is $20. Therefore, the selling price for the merchant is $120. We can now calculate the markup percentage from the wholesale price to the normal retail price. Markup percentage = (Selling price - Wholesale price) / Wholesale price x 100% Markup percentage = ($120 - $100) / $100 x 100% Markup percentage = 20% Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 20%. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A shopkeeper sells his goods at cost price but uses a faulty meter that weighs 800 grams. Find the profit percent. Answer Choices: (A) 100/17% (B) 100/23% (C) 100/19% (D) 100/4% (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve the problem step by step. Let's assume that the cost price of the goods is $100. But the shopkeeper uses a faulty meter that weighs 800 grams instead of 1 kilogram (1000 grams). So, the customer gets only 800 grams of goods for the price of 1 kilogram. To find the selling price of 1 kilogram of goods, we can use the formula: Selling price = Cost price / (Weight of goods / Weight sold) Selling price = 100 / (1000 / 800) = $80 So, the shopkeeper is selling 1 kilogram of goods at $80, which is the cost price of 800 grams of goods. Now, let's calculate the profit percent: Profit = Selling price - Cost price = $80 - $100 = -$20 The profit is negative because the shopkeeper is selling the goods at cost price. Profit percent = (Profit / Cost price) x 100 = (-$20 / $100) x 100 = -20% So, the answer is (E) None of these, as none of the given options match the calculated profit percent of -20%. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Arun purchased 30 kg of wheat at the rate of Rs. 11.50 per kg and 20 kg of wheat at the rate of 14.25 per kg. He mixed the two and sold the mixture. Approximately what price per kg should be sell the mixture to make 35% profit? Answer Choices: (A) 16.39 (B) 16.33 (C) 16.35 (D) 17.01 (E) 16.32\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost price of the wheat that Arun purchased: Cost price of 30 kg of wheat = 30 x 11.50 = Rs. 345 Cost price of 20 kg of wheat = 20 x 14.25 = Rs. 285 Total cost price = 345 + 285 = Rs. 630 Now, Arun wants to make a 35% profit on this cost price. So, the selling price of the mixture should be: Selling price = Cost price + Profit Profit = 35% of Cost price = 0.35 x 630 = Rs. 220.50 Selling price = 630 + 220.50 = Rs. 850.50 Finally, we need to find the price per kg of the mixture. Arun has a total of 50 kg of wheat (30 kg + 20 kg), so: Price per kg = Selling price / Total quantity Price per kg = 850.50 / 50 = Rs. 17.01 Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 17.01. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
