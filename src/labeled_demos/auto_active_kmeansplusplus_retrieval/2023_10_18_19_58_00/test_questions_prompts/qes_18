  "test_question": "Q: A number is as much greater than 36 as is less than 86. Find the Number. Answer Choices: (A) 60 (B) 56 (C) 51 (D) 61 (E) 41",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: 56, 63, 59, 11, 57, 6, 11\nWhich of the following numbers is lower than the median but greater than the mean of the set of the numbers in the list? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 32 (C) 49 (D) 56 (E) 58\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the median of the set of numbers. To do this, we need to arrange the numbers in order from least to greatest: 6, 11, 11, 56, 57, 59, 63 The median is the middle number, which is 56. Next, we need to find the mean of the set of numbers: (6 + 11 + 11 + 56 + 57 + 59 + 63) / 7 = 38 So, we are looking for a number that is lower than 56 but greater than 38. Option (B) 32 is lower than both the median and the mean, so it is not the answer. Option (A) 21 is lower than both the median and the mean, so it is not the answer. Option (C) 49 is greater than the mean but also greater than the median, so it is not the answer. Option (D) 56 is equal to the median, so it is not the answer. Option (E) 58 is greater than the median, so it is not the answer. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: How many 4-digit Q numbers (ABCD) can be formed such that |A \u2013 D| = 2? Answer Choices: (A) 2,000 (B) 1,900 (C) 1,800 (D) 1,600 (E) 1,500\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that |A \u2013 D| = 2. This means that A and D are either 2 digits apart or 2 digits away from each other in the number line. Case 1: A is 2 digits greater than D. In this case, we can choose any digit from 1 to 9 for D (since it's a 4-digit number, we can't have 0 as the first digit). Then, A can be any digit that is 2 greater than D, except for 9 (since we can't have a 5th digit). So, there are 8 choices for A. Case 2: D is 2 digits greater than A. This is the same as Case 1, but with A and D switched. So, there are also 8 choices for A in this case. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit Q numbers that can be formed is 8 + 8 = 16. The answer is (D) 1,600. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: We have 4 people and 1 chairs. In how many ways chairs can be occupy? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 86 (C) 24 (D) 14 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. If we have 4 people and only 1 chair, then only one person can sit on the chair at a time. So, we need to find the number of ways in which we can choose one person out of 4 to sit on the chair. The number of ways to choose one person out of 4 is 4. Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. None of the other options are correct as they are either too high or too low for the given scenario. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: you need to pict any number from 1, 3,5,7,9,11,13 and 15 to make below equation true.\n()+()+()=30\ncan you solve it? Answer Choices: (A) 7+15+9 (B) 6+15+9 (C) 6+14+9 (D) 6+15+8 (E) 8+15+9\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find three odd numbers that add up to 30. The sum of three odd numbers is always an odd number. Therefore, we can eliminate options (B) and (D) since they have an even number in them. Next, we can eliminate option (C) since the sum of 6, 14, and 9 is 29, not 30. Now, we are left with options (A) and (E). We can check both options to see which one adds up to 30. Option (A): 7 + 15 + 9 = 31, not 30. Option (E): 8 + 15 + 9 = 32, not 30. Therefore, none of the given options are correct. The answer is \"None of the above\". The answer is E.\n\n\n"
