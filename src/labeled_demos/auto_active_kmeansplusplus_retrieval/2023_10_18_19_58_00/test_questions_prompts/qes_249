  "formatted_prompt": "Q: An object thrown directly upward is at a height of h feet after t seconds, where h = -15 (t-2)^2 + 150. At what height, in feet, is the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 90 (C) 124 (D) 132 (E) 140\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the maximum height of the object. We can do this by finding the vertex of the quadratic equation h = -15(t-2)^2 + 150. The vertex of a quadratic equation in the form of h = a(t-b)^2 + c is (b, c). In this case, the vertex is (2, 150). This means that the object reaches its maximum height of 150 feet after 2 seconds. Next, we need to find the height of the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height. We can do this by plugging in t = 4 (2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height) into the equation h = -15(t-2)^2 + 150. h = -15(4-2)^2 + 150 h = -15(2)^2 + 150 h = -60 + 150 h = 90 Therefore, the height of the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height is 90 feet. The correct answer is (B) 90. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Two trains of equal lengths take 10 sec and 15 sec respectively to cross a telegraph post. If the length of each train be 120 m, in what time will they cross other travelling in opposite direction? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 12 (C) 13 (D) 14 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. The total distance covered by both trains when they cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is 240 meters. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds, since they are travelling in opposite directions. Let's call this speed \"v\". We know that the first train takes 10 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/10 = 12 m/s. Similarly, the second train takes 15 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/15 = 8 m/s. Therefore, the relative speed of the two trains is v = 12 + 8 = 20 m/s. To find the time it takes for the two trains to cross each other, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed Plugging in the values we know, we get: time = 240 / 20 = 12 seconds Therefore, the answer is (B) 12. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: The greatest possible length which can be used to measure exactly the length 8m ,2m 15cm, 8m 90 cm is? Answer Choices: (A) 25cm (B) 101cm (C) 56cm (D) 42cm (E) 5cm\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the given lengths. 8m = 800cm 2m 15cm = 215cm 8m 90cm = 890cm Now, we need to find the GCF of 800, 215, and 890. The prime factorization of 800 is 2^5 x 5^2. The prime factorization of 215 is 5 x 43. The prime factorization of 890 is 2 x 5 x 89. The GCF of these three numbers is 5, since it is the only factor they have in common. Therefore, the greatest possible length that can be used to measure exactly 8m, 2m 15cm, and 8m 90cm is 5cm. The answer is (E) 5cm. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A HEXAGON IS FORMED ABCDEF WHICH PERIMETER 36cm. A POLYGON IS FORMED BY JOINING THE POINTS AE &BD . FIND THE AREA OF THE POLYGON ABDE? Answer Choices: (A) 34\u221a3 cm2 (B) 35\u221a3 cm2 (C) 36\u221a3 cm2 (D) 37\u221a3 cm2 (E) 38\u221a3 cm2\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length of each side of the hexagon. Since the perimeter is 36cm and there are six sides, each side has a length of 6cm. Next, we need to find the area of triangle ABE. We can use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is 1/2 * base * height. The base is AB, which has a length of 6cm. To find the height, we need to draw a perpendicular line from E to AB. Let's call the point where the perpendicular line intersects AB point G. Triangle AEG is a 30-60-90 triangle, so the height EG is 3\u221a3 cm. Therefore, the area of triangle ABE is 1/2 * 6cm * 3\u221a3 cm = 9\u221a3 cm2. We can use the same method to find the area of triangle BDE. The base is BD, which also has a length of 6cm. To find the height, we need to draw a perpendicular line from D to BD. Let's call the point where the perpendicular line intersects BD point H. Triangle BDH is also a 30-60-90 triangle, so the height DH is 3\u221a3 cm. Therefore, the area of triangle BDE is 1/2 * 6cm * 3\u221a3 cm = 9\u221a3 cm2. Finally, we can find the area of the polygon ABDE by adding the areas of triangles ABE and BDE. 9\u221a3 cm2 + 9\u221a3 cm2 = 18\u221a3 cm2. Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) since none of the given answer choices match our calculated answer of 18\u221a3 cm2. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
