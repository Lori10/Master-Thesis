  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A salesman\u2019s terms were changed from a flat commission of 5% on all his sales to a fixed salary of Rs.900 plus 2.5% commission on all sales exceeding Rs. 4,000. If his remuneration as per new scheme was Rs. 600 more than that by the previous schema, his sales were worth? Answer Choices: (A) 10000 (B) 12000 (C) 12019 (D) 12197 (E) 12012\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the salesman's sales be x. Under the previous scheme, his commission would be 5% of x, which is 0.05x. Under the new scheme, his commission on sales exceeding Rs. 4,000 would be 2.5% of (x-4000), which is 0.025(x-4000). In addition, he has a fixed salary of Rs. 900. So his remuneration under the new scheme would be: 0.025(x-4000) + 900 And we know that this is Rs. 600 more than his remuneration under the previous scheme, which was 0.05x. So we can set up an equation: 0.025(x-4000) + 900 = 0.05x + 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.025x - 100 + 900 = 0.05x + 600 0.025x + 800 = 0.05x + 600 0.025x = 200 x = 8000 Therefore, his sales were worth Rs. 8,000. None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Rahim bought 65 books for Rs.1150 from one shop and 50 books for Rs.920 from another. What is the average price he paid per book ? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 18 (C) 99 (D) 787 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total cost of all the books Rahim bought. Total cost = Rs.1150 + Rs.920 = Rs.2070 Next, we need to find the total number of books Rahim bought. Total number of books = 65 + 50 = 115 Finally, we can find the average price per book by dividing the total cost by the total number of books. Average price per book = Total cost / Total number of books Average price per book = Rs.2070 / 115 Average price per book = Rs.18 Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 18. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If a quarter kg of potato costs 60 paise, how many paise does 200 gm cost? Answer Choices: (A) 65 paise (B) 70 paise (C) 52 paise (D) 48 paise (E) 75 paise\nA: Let's think step by step. Given, 1/4 kg of potato costs 60 paise. We need to find the cost of 200 gm of potato. 1/4 kg = 250 gm So, 250 gm of potato costs 60 paise. Now, we need to find the cost of 200 gm of potato. We can use the unitary method to solve this problem. 250 gm costs 60 paise 1 gm costs (60/250) paise 200 gm costs (60/250) x 200 = 48 paise Therefore, the answer is (D) 48 paise. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Gautami went to the stationers and bought things worth Rs. 100, out of which 50 paise went on sales tax on taxable purchases. If the tax rate was 5%. then what was the cost of the tax free items? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 99.50 (B) Rs. 70.50 (C) Rs. 89.50 (D) Rs. 69.50 (E) Rs. 80.50\nA: Let's think step by step. The total cost of the items including tax is Rs. 100. Out of this, 50 paise (or Rs. 0.50) went on sales tax. We know that the tax rate is 5%. So, we can set up an equation: 5% of the taxable purchases = Rs. 0.50 To find the cost of tax-free items, we need to subtract the tax amount from the total cost: Cost of tax-free items = Total cost - Tax amount Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 100 - Rs. 0.50 Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 99.50 Therefore, the answer is (A) Rs. 99.50. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
