  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The difference between a positive proper fraction and its reciprocal is 9/20. The fraction is? Answer Choices: (A) 4/5 (B) 4/7 (C) 5 (D) 5/7 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the fraction be x/y. According to the problem, x/y - y/x = 9/20 Multiplying both sides by xy, we get x^2 - y^2 = 9xy/20 Simplifying, 20x^2 - 20y^2 = 9xy 20x^2 - 9xy - 20y^2 = 0 We can factor this as (4x - 5y)(5x + 4y) = 0 So either 4x - 5y = 0 or 5x + 4y = 0. If 4x - 5y = 0, then x/y = 5/4. If 5x + 4y = 0, then x/y = -4/5, but this is not a positive proper fraction. Therefore, the answer is (A) 4/5. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Seventy five percent of a number is 21 less than four fifth of that number. What is the number ? Answer Choices: (A) 240 (B) 340 (C) 420 (D) 130 (E) 125\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the number to be 'x'. According to the problem, 75% of the number is 21 less than 4/5 of the number. Translating this into an equation: 0.75x = (4/5)x - 21 Simplifying this equation: 0.75x - (4/5)x = -21 (15/20)x - (16/20)x = -21 (-1/20)x = -21 x = (-21) * (-20) x = 420 Therefore, the answer is (C) 420. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Let f(x,y) be defined as the remainder when (x\u2013y)! is divided by x. If x=16, what is the maximum value of y for which f(x,y)=0? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 10 (C) 15 (D) 20 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the value of (x-y)!. Since x=16, we have (16-y)!. Next, we need to find the remainder when (16-y)! is divided by 16. This means we need to find the largest value of y such that (16-y)! is divisible by 16. We know that 16=2^4, so we need to find the largest power of 2 that divides (16-y)!. We can use the formula for the highest power of a prime p that divides n!, which is given by: \u230an/p\u230b + \u230an/p^2\u230b + \u230an/p^3\u230b + ... where \u230ax\u230b denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. In this case, p=2 and n=16-y, so we have: \u230a(16-y)/2\u230b + \u230a(16-y)/4\u230b + \u230a(16-y)/8\u230b + \u230a(16-y)/16\u230b Simplifying this expression, we get: 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15 So the largest power of 2 that divides (16-y)! is 2^15. Therefore, the maximum value of y for which f(x,y)=0 is 15. The answer is (C) 15. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: (A% of 5B + B% of A) is equal to ? Answer Choices: (A) A% of B (B) B% of A (C) 6% of AB (D) AB% of 3 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. We can start by simplifying the expression given in the question: (A% of 5B + B% of A) = (A/100 * 5B) + (B/100 * A) = AB/20 + AB/100 Now, we can try to simplify this expression further: AB/20 + AB/100 = (5AB + AB)/100 = 6AB/100 = 6% of AB Therefore, the answer is (C) 6% of AB. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
