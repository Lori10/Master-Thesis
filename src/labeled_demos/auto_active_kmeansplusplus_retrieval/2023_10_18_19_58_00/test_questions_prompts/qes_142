  "test_question": "Q: If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur? Answer Choices: (A) 0.22 (B) 0.26 (C) 0.37 (D) 0.46 (E) 0.63",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A invested $300 in a business after 6 months B invested $200 in the business. End of the year if they got $100 as profit. Find A shares? Answer Choices: (A) $100 (B) $75 (C) $20 (D) $120 (E) $50\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total investment made by A and B. A invested $300 for 12 months, so his total investment is $300 * 12 = $3600. B invested $200 for 12 months, so his total investment is $200 * 12 = $2400. Next, we need to find the ratio of their investments. A invested $3600 and B invested $2400, so the ratio of their investments is 3600:2400, which simplifies to 3:2. Now, we need to find A's share of the profit. Since the ratio of their investments is 3:2, A's share of the profit is 3/5 of the total profit. Therefore, A's share of the profit is $100 * 3/5 = $60. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above, as none of the given answer choices match the calculated answer of $60. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: In a class, 30% of the students speaks truth, 20% speaks lie and 10% speaks both. If a student is selected at random, what is the probability that he has speak truth or lie? Answer Choices: (A) 1/4 (B) 2/3 (C) 3/5 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the percentage of students who speak either truth or lie. Percentage of students who speak truth = 30% Percentage of students who speak lie = 20% However, we need to subtract the percentage of students who speak both truth and lie, as they have been counted twice. Percentage of students who speak both truth and lie = 10% Therefore, the percentage of students who speak either truth or lie = 30% + 20% - 10% = 40%. So, the probability that a student selected at random speaks truth or lie is 40%. Answer: None of the above (as none of the answer choices match 40%). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A mailman puts .05% of letters in the wrong mailbox. How many deliveries must he make to misdeliver 2 items? Answer Choices: (A) 4000 (B) 400 (C) 40 (D) 40000 (E) 4500\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert .05% to a decimal, which is 0.0005. This represents the probability of a letter being misdelivered. Let's call the number of deliveries the mailman makes \"x\". We want to find the value of x that results in 2 misdelivered items. To set up the equation, we can use the formula for probability: probability = number of desired outcomes / total number of outcomes In this case, the desired outcome is 2 misdelivered items, and the total number of outcomes is the number of deliveries the mailman makes (x). So we can write: 0.0005x = 2 To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.0005: x = 2 / 0.0005 x = 4000 Therefore, the answer is (A) 4000. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: If the numbers 1 to 97 are written on 97 pieces of paper, (one on each) and one piece is picked at random, then What is the probability that the number drawn is neither prime nor composite? Answer Choices: (A) 1/50 (B) 1/25 (C) 1/97 (D) 1 (E) 2\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to understand what is meant by \"neither prime nor composite.\" A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself (e.g. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). A composite number is a number that is not prime and has more than two factors (e.g. 4, 6, 8, 9, 10). Therefore, a number that is neither prime nor composite is a number that has exactly two factors (1 and itself), which is only possible for the number 1. So, out of the numbers 1 to 97, only the number 1 is neither prime nor composite. Therefore, the probability of picking the number 1 is 1/97. Answer: (C) 1/97. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
