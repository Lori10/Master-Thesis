  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Peter has $642,986 in his savings account. What is the least amount of money (in whole number of dollars) that he must add to his account if he wants to split this money evenly among his nine children? Answer Choices: (A) $642,986 (B) $642,987 (C) $642,988 (D) $642,989 (E) $642,990\nA: Let's think step by step. Peter wants to split his savings evenly among his nine children. This means he needs to divide his savings by 9 to find out how much each child will get. $642,986 \u00f7 9 = $71,443.88 However, we need to add a whole number of dollars to his account, so we need to round up to the nearest dollar. $71,443.88 rounded up to the nearest dollar is $71,444. Therefore, Peter needs to add $71,444 to his savings account to split the money evenly among his nine children. The correct answer is (D) $642,989. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Kiran has 85 currency notes in all, some of which were of Rs. 100 denomination and the\nremaining of Rs. 50 denomination. The total amount of all these currency notes was Rs.\n5000. How much amount did she have in the denomination of Rs. 50?\nA. B. C. None of these D.\nAnswer: Option B\nExplanation: Answer Choices: (A) 1900 (B) 3500 (C) 4000 (D) 2000 (E) 2500\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the number of Rs. 100 notes be x and the number of Rs. 50 notes be y. We know that x + y = 85 (total number of notes) and 100x + 50y = 5000 (total amount). Simplifying the second equation, we get 2x + y = 100. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get x = 25 and y = 60. Therefore, the amount in the denomination of Rs. 50 is 50 * 60 = 3000. So, the correct answer is option B. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In order to obtain an income of Rs. 650 from 10% stock at Rs. 96, one must make an investment of Answer Choices: (A) 5363 (B) 6240 (C) 2368 (D) 1987 (E) 2732\nA: Let's think step by step. The annual income from the stock is 10% of the investment. So, we can set up the equation: 10% of the investment = Rs. 650 0.1 x investment = 650 investment = 650 / 0.1 investment = Rs. 6,500 Now, we need to find out how many shares can be bought with an investment of Rs. 6,500 at Rs. 96 per share. Number of shares = investment / share price Number of shares = 6,500 / 96 Number of shares = 67.71 (approx.) Since we cannot buy a fraction of a share, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Number of shares = 68 Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 2732, which is the total investment required to buy 68 shares at Rs. 96 per share. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A, B and C rent a pasture. A puts 10 oxen for 7 months, B puts 12 oxen for 5 months and C puts 15 oxen for 3 months for grazing. If the rent of the pasture is Rs. 245, how much must C pay as his share of rent? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 50 (C) 55 (D) 63 (E) none\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of oxen-months contributed by all three people. A contributed 10 oxen for 7 months, so that's 10 x 7 = 70 oxen-months. B contributed 12 oxen for 5 months, so that's 12 x 5 = 60 oxen-months. C contributed 15 oxen for 3 months, so that's 15 x 3 = 45 oxen-months. The total number of oxen-months is 70 + 60 + 45 = 175. Now we need to find out what fraction of the total rent C should pay. C contributed 45 oxen-months out of a total of 175, which is 45/175. To find out how much C should pay, we need to multiply this fraction by the total rent: (45/175) x 245 = 63 So C should pay Rs. 63 as his share of the rent. The correct answer is (D) 63. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
