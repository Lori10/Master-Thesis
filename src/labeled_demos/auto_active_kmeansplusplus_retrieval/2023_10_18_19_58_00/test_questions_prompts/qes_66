How many students are there in the class? Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: There are 600 boys in a hostel. Each plays either hockey or football or both. If 75% play hockey and 45% play football, how many play both? Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 150 (C) 200 (D) 180 (E) 160\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 75% of the boys play hockey, which means 0.75 x 600 = 450 boys play hockey. Similarly, 45% of the boys play football, which means 0.45 x 600 = 270 boys play football. Now, we need to find out how many boys play both hockey and football. Let's assume that x boys play both. We know that the total number of boys who play either hockey or football is 600. So, we can write an equation: Number of boys who play hockey + Number of boys who play football - Number of boys who play both = Total number of boys 450 + 270 - x = 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 720 - x = 600 x = 120 Therefore, 120 boys play both hockey and football. The correct answer is (A) 120. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: In a class, 30% of the students speaks truth, 20% speaks lie and 10% speaks both. If a student is selected at random, what is the probability that he has speak truth or lie? Answer Choices: (A) 1/4 (B) 2/3 (C) 3/5 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the percentage of students who speak either truth or lie. Percentage of students who speak truth = 30% Percentage of students who speak lie = 20% However, we need to subtract the percentage of students who speak both truth and lie, as they have been counted twice. Percentage of students who speak both truth and lie = 10% Therefore, the percentage of students who speak either truth or lie = 30% + 20% - 10% = 40%. So, the probability that a student selected at random speaks truth or lie is 40%. Answer: None of the above (as none of the answer choices match 40%). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A pupil's marks were wrongly entered as 85 instead of 45. Due to that the average marks for the class got increased by half. The number of pupils in the class is : Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 80 (C) 20 (D) 25 (E) 26\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume there were 'n' pupils in the class before the wrong entry was made. The total marks of all the pupils before the correction = n * average marks After the correction, the total marks of all the pupils = (n-1) * average marks + 85 We know that the average marks increased by half, which means: (n-1) * average marks + 85 = (n * average marks) + (0.5 * n * average marks) Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.5 * n * average marks = 85 - average marks 0.5 * n * average marks = 40 n * average marks = 80 We know that the average marks of the class is (85 + 45)/2 = 65 So, n * 65 = 80 n = 80/65 = 1.23 Since the number of pupils cannot be a decimal, we can round it up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the number of pupils in the class is 25. Hence, the answer is (D) 25. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: At a contest with 2,500 participants, 1/2 of the people are aged 10 to 12. Next year, the number of people aged 10 to 12 will increase by 1/5. After this change, what percentage of the total 2,500 people will the 10- to 12-year-olds represent? Answer Choices: (A) 55% (B) 60% (C) 50% (D) 45% (E) 66%\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 at the contest. 1/2 of 2,500 = 1,250 people aged 10 to 12. Step 2: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1/5 of 1,250 = 250 people increase. 1,250 + 250 = 1,500 people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. Step 3: Find the percentage of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1,500/2,500 x 100% = 60% Therefore, the answer is (B) 60%. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
