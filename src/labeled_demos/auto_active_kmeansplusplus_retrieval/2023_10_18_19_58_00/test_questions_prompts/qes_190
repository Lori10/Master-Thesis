  "test_question": "Q: The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 28 (C) 30 (D) 53 (E) 59",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Five drainage pipes, each draining water from a pool at the same constant rate, together can drain a certain pool in 12 days. How many additional pipes, each draining water at the same constant rate, will be needed to drain the pool in 6 days? Answer Choices: (A)  5 (B)  9 (C)  10 (D)  12 (E)  15\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to understand that the rate of draining water is constant for each pipe. Let's say the rate of each pipe is x. We know that 5 pipes can drain the pool in 12 days. So, the total amount of water in the pool is 5x * 12 = 60x. Now, we want to drain the same pool in half the time, which is 6 days. So, the total amount of water drained should be the same, which is 60x. Let's say we need n additional pipes to drain the pool in 6 days. So, the total number of pipes will be 5 + n. We can use the formula: total amount of water drained = rate * time 60x = (5 + n) * x * 6 Simplifying this equation, we get: 60x = 30x + 6nx 30x = 6nx n = 5 Therefore, we need 5 additional pipes to drain the pool in 6 days. The answer is (A) 5. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Jill has 21 gallons of water stored in quart, half-gallon, and one gallon jars. She has equal numbers of each size jar holding the liquid. What is the total number of water filled jars? Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 6 (C) 9 (D) 36 (E) 14\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert all the jars to the same unit, either quarts, half-gallons, or gallons. Let's convert everything to quarts since it's the smallest unit. One gallon is equal to 4 quarts, so Jill has 21 x 4 = 84 quarts of water. Let's say she has x jars of each size. Each quart jar contains 1 quart of water, each half-gallon jar contains 2 quarts of water, and each gallon jar contains 4 quarts of water. So we can set up the equation: 1x + 2x + 4x = 84 7x = 84 x = 12 Therefore, Jill has 12 jars of each size, for a total of 3 x 12 = 36 jars. The answer is (D) 36. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A pump can fill a tank with water in 2 hours. Because of a leak, it took 2 hours to fill the tank. The leak can drain all the water of the tank in: Answer Choices: (A) 4 hours (B) 7 hours (C) 8 hours (D) 14 hours (E) 15 hours\nA: Let's think step by step. The pump can fill the tank in 2 hours, so in 1 hour it can fill 1/2 of the tank. Let's assume the leak can drain the entire tank in x hours. In 2 hours, the pump fills the entire tank, but during this time the leak also drains some water. Let's say the leak drains 1/2 of the tank in 2 hours. So, in 2 hours, the pump fills 1/2 of the tank and the leak drains 1/2 of the tank. This means that the net amount of water added to the tank in 2 hours is 0. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 1/2 - 1/x = 0 Solving for x, we get: 1/x = 1/2 x = 2 Therefore, the leak can drain the entire tank in 2 hours. The correct answer is (A) 4 hours. None of the given options match the correct answer. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: the ratio of water and milk is 2:3.after adding 4litre milk ratio become 1:2? calculate amount of water? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 8 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. Initially, let's assume that the amount of water in the mixture is 2x and the amount of milk is 3x. So, the total amount of the mixture is 2x + 3x = 5x. After adding 4 liters of milk, the total amount of the mixture becomes 5x + 4. Now, the ratio of water to milk is 1:2, which means the amount of water is x and the amount of milk is 2x. So, we can write the equation as: 2x + 4 = 2(2x) Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x + 4 = 4x 2x = 4 x = 2 Therefore, the amount of water in the mixture initially was 2x = 2(2) = 4 liters. So, the correct answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the calculated answer. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
