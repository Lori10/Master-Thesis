  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Rahim bought 65 books for Rs.1150 from one shop and 50 books for Rs.920 from another. What is the average price he paid per book ? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 18 (C) 99 (D) 787 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total cost of all the books Rahim bought. Total cost = Rs.1150 + Rs.920 = Rs.2070 Next, we need to find the total number of books Rahim bought. Total number of books = 65 + 50 = 115 Finally, we can find the average price per book by dividing the total cost by the total number of books. Average price per book = Total cost / Total number of books Average price per book = Rs.2070 / 115 Average price per book = Rs.18 Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 18. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A camera lens filter kit containing 5 filters sells for $52.50. If the filters are purchased individually, 2 of them are priced at $6.45 each, 2 at $11.05 each, 1 at $15.50. The amount saved by purchasing the kit is what percent of the total price of the 5 filters purchased individually? Answer Choices: (A) 3.76% (B) 4.76% (C) 5.76% (D) 6.76% (E) 7.76%\nA: Let's think step by step. The total cost of purchasing the filters individually is: 2 x $6.45 + 2 x $11.05 + $15.50 = $31.50 The cost of purchasing the kit is $52.50. The amount saved by purchasing the kit is: $31.50 - $52.50 = -$21.00 This means that purchasing the kit costs $21.00 more than purchasing the filters individually. To find the percentage of the total price saved by purchasing the kit, we need to divide the amount saved by the total cost of purchasing the filters individually and then multiply by 100: (-$21.00 / $31.50) x 100 = -66.67% This means that purchasing the kit costs 66.67% more than purchasing the filters individually. However, the question asks for the percentage of the total price saved, not the percentage of the total price increased. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: A meal cost $ 37.25 adn there was no tax. If the tip was more than 10 pc but less than 15pc of the price, then the total amount paid should be: Answer Choices: (A) 42-45 (B) 41-43 (C) 39-41 (D) 37-39 (E) 36-37\nA: Let's think step by step. The meal cost is $37.25 and there is no tax. Let's assume the tip is x% of the meal cost. So, the total amount paid will be: $37.25 + (x/100)*$37.25 Simplifying this expression: $37.25*(1 + x/100)$ We know that the tip is more than 10% but less than 15% of the price. So, 10% < x < 15% Let's substitute the values of x in the expression we derived above: For x = 10%, the total amount paid will be: $37.25*(1 + 10/100) = $41. For x = 15%, the total amount paid will be: $37.25*(1 + 15/100) = $42.79. Therefore, the total amount paid should be between $41 and $42.79. The closest answer choice is (A) 42-45. So, the correct answer is (A) 42-45. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: If a 10% deposit amounting to $110 has been paid toward buying a brand new TV, how much remains to be paid? Answer Choices: (A) $880 (B) $990 (C) $1000 (D) $1100 (E) $1210\nA: Let's think step by step. The deposit amount is 10% of the total cost of the TV. Let's represent the total cost as \"x\". So, we can write the equation: 10% of x = $110 0.1x = $110 Solving for x: x = $1100 Therefore, the total cost of the TV is $1100. To find out how much remains to be paid, we need to subtract the deposit amount from the total cost: $1100 - $110 = $990 So, the answer is (B) $990. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
