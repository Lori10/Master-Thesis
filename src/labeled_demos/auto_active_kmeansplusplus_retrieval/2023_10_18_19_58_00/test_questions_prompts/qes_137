First, we can multiply 54.327 and 357.2 to get 19416.8104. Then, we can multiply that result by 0.0057 to get 110.8345248. Therefore, the answer is (C) 5.4327 \u00d7 3.572 \u00d7 0.0000057. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Seventy five percent of a number is 21 less than four fifth of that number. What is the number ? Answer Choices: (A) 240 (B) 340 (C) 420 (D) 130 (E) 125\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the number to be 'x'. According to the problem, 75% of the number is 21 less than 4/5 of the number. Translating this into an equation: 0.75x = (4/5)x - 21 Simplifying this equation: 0.75x - (4/5)x = -21 (15/20)x - (16/20)x = -21 (-1/20)x = -21 x = (-21) * (-20) x = 420 Therefore, the answer is (C) 420. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In a division sum, the divisor is ten times the quotient and five times the remainder. If the remainder is 38, the dividend is: Answer Choices: (A) 3648 (B) 3642 (C) 3636 (D) 3644 (E) 3864\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the quotient to be x. According to the problem, the divisor is ten times the quotient, which means the divisor is 10x. Also, the divisor is five times the remainder, which means the remainder is 10x/5 or 2x. Given that the remainder is 38, we can solve for x: 2x = 38 x = 19 Now that we know the quotient is 19, we can find the dividend by using the formula: Dividend = Divisor x Quotient + Remainder Dividend = 10x19 + 38 Dividend = 190 + 38 Dividend = 228 Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above, as none of the options match the calculated dividend of 228. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If w = 9/25, c = 15/32, and m + w + c = 1, which of the following gives the values of m, w, and c in increasing order? Answer Choices: (A) c, m, w (B) c, w, m (C) m, w, c (D) w, c, m (E) w, m, c\nA: Let's think step by step. Given, w = 9/25, c = 15/32, and m + w + c = 1. We need to find the values of m, w, and c in increasing order. We can rearrange the equation m + w + c = 1 to get m = 1 - w - c. Substituting the given values of w and c, we get m = 1 - 9/25 - 15/32. Simplifying, we get m = 223/800. Now we can compare the values of m, w, and c to find the correct order. w = 9/25 = 288/800 c = 15/32 = 375/800 So, the correct order is: w, m, c Therefore, the answer is (E) w, m, c. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
