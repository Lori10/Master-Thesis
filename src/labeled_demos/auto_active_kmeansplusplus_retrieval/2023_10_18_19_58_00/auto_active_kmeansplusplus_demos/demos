            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. First, we can simplify the second ratio by cross-multiplying to get z(y + x) = (y)(y + x), which simplifies to y^2 = zx. Next, we can substitute this expression for y^2 into the first ratio to get y/(x - z) = (y + x)/z = x/zx^(1/2). Simplifying this expression, we get y = x^(3/2)/(x - z) and z = x^(1/2)/(x - z). Now, we can substitute these expressions for y and z into the ratio y^2 : x : z to get x^(3/2)/(x - z)^2 : x : x^(1/2)/(x - z). Simplifying this expression, we get x^(5/2) : x(x - z)^2 : x^(3/2)(x - z). Cancelling out an x from each term, we get x^(3/2) : (x - z)^2 : x^(1/2). Now, we can substitute the expression for z from earlier (z = x^(1/2)/(x - z)) into this ratio to get x^(3/2) : (x - x^(1/2))^2 : x^(1/2). Simplifying this expression, we get x^(3/2) : (x^2 - 2x^(3/2) + x) : x^(1/2). Finally, we can simplify the middle term by expanding the square and combining like terms to get x^(3/2) : (x^2 - 2x^(3/2) + x) : x^(1/2) = x^(3/2) : (x^2 - x^(3/2)) : x^(1/2) = x^(1/2) : (x - 1) : 1. Therefore, the answer is (E) none of these, since none of the given answer choices match the ratio x^(1/2) : (x - 1) : 1.",

In 2 hours, the pump fills the entire tank, but during this time the leak also drains some water. Let's say the leak drains 1/2 of the tank in 2 hours. So, in 2 hours, the pump fills 1/2 of the tank and the leak drains 1/2 of the tank. This means that the net amount of water added to the tank in 2 hours is 0. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 1/2 - 1/x = 0 Solving for x, we get: 1/x = 1/2 x = 2 Therefore, the leak can drain the entire tank in 2 hours. The correct answer is (A) 4 hours.

The area of the courtyard is given by multiplying its length and width: Area = 3.78 x 5.95 = 22.545 square meters Let's assume that each tile has a side length of x meters. Then the number of tiles needed to cover the courtyard can be found by dividing the area of the courtyard by the area of each tile: Number of tiles = Area of courtyard / Area of each tile Number of tiles = 22.545 / x^2 For the largest size of the tile, we want to minimize the number of tiles needed. This means we want to maximize the size of each tile. To maximize the size of each tile, we need to minimize the number of tiles. The number of tiles is minimized when each tile is as large as possible. So, we need to find the largest perfect square that is a factor of 22.545. 22.545 = 3 x 3 x 2.505 The largest perfect square that is a factor of 22.545 is 9.

The provision of food for 150 men for 60 days means that the fort has food for 150 x 60 = 9000 man-days. Step 2: Find the amount of food consumed in the first 10 days. Since there were 150 men in the fort for the first 10 days, the amount of food consumed in the first 10 days is 150 x 10 = 1500 man-days. Step 3: Find the amount of food remaining after 10 days. The amount of food remaining after 10 days is 9000 - 1500 = 7500 man-days. Step 4: Find the number of men remaining in the fort. After 25 men left the fort, the number of men remaining in the fort is 150 - 25 = 125. Step 5: Find the number of days for which the remaining food will last. Let's assume that the remaining food will last for x days. Since the same amount of food is now available for 125 men, the amount of food required for x days is 125x man-days. We know that this amount of food is equal to the remaining food in the fort, which is 7500 man-days.

The vertex of a quadratic equation in the form of h = a(t-b)^2 + c is (b, c). In this case, the vertex is (2, 150). This means that the object reaches its maximum height of 150 feet after 2 seconds. Next, we need to find the height of the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height. We can do this by plugging in t = 4 (2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height) into the equation h = -15(t-2)^2 + 150. h = -15(4-2)^2 + 150 h = -15(2)^2 + 150 h = -60 + 150 h = 90 Therefore, the height of the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height is 90 feet.

If the merchant sells the sweater at a 60% discount, he sells it for 40% of the original price, which is $40. Now, we know that the merchant makes a 20% profit on the wholesale cost at which he initially purchased the item. So, the cost price for the merchant is $100, and he makes a profit of 20%, which is $20. Therefore, the selling price for the merchant is $120. We can now calculate the markup percentage from the wholesale price to the normal retail price. Markup percentage = (Selling price - Wholesale price) / Wholesale price x 100% Markup percentage = ($120 - $100) / $100 x 100% Markup percentage = 20% Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 20%.",

Let's try 97. 97 is a prime number, so its only prime factor is itself. The product of this prime is 97, which is less than the square root of 97 (which is approximately 9.85). Therefore, 97 is prime saturated. Let's try 96. The prime factors of 96 are 2, 3, and 5. The product of these primes is 30, which is less than the square root of 96 (which is approximately 9.8). Therefore, 96 is prime saturated. Let's try 95. The prime factors of 95 are 5 and 19. The product of these primes is 95, which is equal to the square root of 95. Therefore, 95 is not prime saturated. Therefore, the greatest prime saturated two-digit integer is 98, which is option (B).",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that there are 100 passengers on the ship. 40% of the passengers held round-trip tickets and took their cars abroad the ship, which means there are 40 passengers who fit this description. Now, we know that 50% of the passengers with round-trip tickets did not take their cars abroad the ship. So, out of the 40 passengers with round-trip tickets, 50% did not take their cars, which means 20 passengers did not take their cars. Therefore, the remaining 20 passengers with round-trip tickets did take their cars abroad the ship. To find the percentage of passengers with round-trip tickets, we divide the total number of passengers (100) into the number of passengers with round-trip tickets (40). 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%. So, the answer is (A) 40%.",

So, the probability of getting 4 consecutive tails in 5 throws can be calculated as follows: Probability = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/32 However, we need to take into account that A has already gotten a tail in the first throw.

The cost of fencing the plot is Rs. 26.50 per metre. Therefore, the total cost of fencing the rectangular plot is: Perimeter of the plot x Cost per metre = (2 x length + 2 x breadth) x 26.50 Substituting the values of length and breadth, we get: (2(x+20) + 2x) x 26.50 = 7420 Simplifying the equation, we get: 6.5x + 530 = 371 6.5x = 371 - 530 6.5x = -159 x = -24.46 Since the breadth cannot be negative, this answer is not possible.

After the decrease of 5%, the new number of seats will be 95 (100 - 5% of 100) and the new price of a ticket will be $9.50 (10 - 5% of 10). Therefore, the new revenue collected can be calculated as follows: New revenue = New number of seats x New price of a ticket New revenue = 95 x 9.50 New revenue = $902.50 Now, let's compare the new revenue with the original revenue: Original revenue = Original number of seats x Original price of a ticket Original revenue = 100 x 10 Original revenue = $1000 The percentage decrease in revenue can be calculated as follows: Percentage decrease = (Original revenue - New revenue) / Original revenue x 100% Percentage decrease = (1000 - 902.50) / 1000 x 100% Percentage decrease = 9.75% Therefore, the answer is (C) -9.75%.",

We can use this information to try and find a relationship between the letters in \"COMPUTER\" and the letters in \"VIRUS\" and \"WORM\". One possible relationship is that the code for each letter in \"VIRUS\" and \"WORM\" is equal to the code for the corresponding letter in \"COMPUTER\" plus a certain constant. Let's call this constant \"k\". Using this relationship, we can set up two equations: V + k + I + k + R + k + U + k + S + k = ? W + k + O + k + R + k + M + k = ? We don't know the values of \"k\" or the sum of the codes, but we can simplify the equations by combining like terms: (5k + V + I + R + U + S) = ? (4k + W + O + R + M) = ? We still don't have enough information to solve for the sum of the codes, but we can use the fact that the sum of the codes is a multiple of 3 (since 111 is a multiple of 3). Looking at the simplified equations, we can see that the sum of the letters in \"VIRUS\" is 5 + V + I + R + U + S, which is odd (since 5 is odd).

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the retailer originally ordered x number of white and yellow tennis balls each. According to the problem, the dispatch clerk dispatched 50 extra yellow balls. So, the total number of yellow balls became (x + 50) and the number of white balls remained x. Now, the ratio of white balls to yellow balls is given as 7/11. So, we can write the equation: x/(x+50) = 7/11 Cross-multiplying, we get: 11x = 7(x+50) 11x = 7x + 350 4x = 350 x = 87.5 Therefore, the retailer originally ordered 87.5 white and 87.5 yellow tennis balls each. But since we need to find the total number of tennis balls, we add them up: 87.5 + 87.5 + 50 (extra yellow balls) = 225 So, the correct answer is (None of the above) 225.",

If he exceeds his days by 4 days, he would have to cut down his daily expenses by Rs 3. This means his new daily expenses would be (360/(x+4)) - 3. We can set up an equation: 360/x = (360/(x+4)) - 3 Multiplying both sides by x(x+4), we get: 360(x+4) = 360x - 3x(x+4) Simplifying, we get: 1440 = -3x^2 + 48x + 1440 Rearranging, we get: 3x^2 - 48x = 0 Dividing both sides by 3x, we get: x - 16 = 0 Therefore, x = 16.

Next, we need to find the number of pairs of dogs that are littermates. For the 6 dogs with exactly 1 littermate, each dog has only one possible littermate, so there are 6 pairs of littermates. For the 3 dogs with exactly 2 littermates, each dog has 2 possible littermates, so there are 3 * 2 = 6 pairs of littermates. So there are a total of 6 + 6 = 12 pairs of littermates. Finally, we can use the formula for probability: Q = (number of pairs that are not littermates) / (total number of pairs) Q = (36 - 12) / 36 = 24 / 36 = 2/3 Therefore, the answer is (B) 2/9.",

Next, we need to find out how far the thief has traveled in 1.5 hours at 60 km/hr. Distance = Speed x Time, so distance = 60 km/hr x 1.5 hr = 90 km. Now, we can set up an equation to find out when the owner will overtake the thief. Let t be the time it takes for the owner to catch up to the thief. The distance the owner travels is the same as the distance the thief travels plus the 90 km the thief traveled before the owner set off. So: 75t = 90 + 60t Simplifying this equation, we get: 15t = 90 t = 6 So it will take the owner 6 hours to catch up to the thief.

Since the perimeter is 36cm and there are six sides, each side has a length of 6cm. Next, we need to find the area of triangle ABE. We can use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is 1/2 * base * height. The base is AB, which has a length of 6cm. To find the height, we need to draw a perpendicular line from E to AB. Let's call the point where the perpendicular line intersects AB point G. Triangle AEG is a 30-60-90 triangle, so the height EG is 3√3 cm. Therefore, the area of triangle ABE is 1/2 * 6cm * 3√3 cm = 9√3 cm2. We can use the same method to find the area of triangle BDE. The base is BD, which also has a length of 6cm. To find the height, we need to draw a perpendicular line from D to BD. Let's call the point where the perpendicular line intersects BD point H. Triangle BDH is also a 30-60-90 triangle, so the height DH is 3√3 cm. Therefore, the area of triangle BDE is 1/2 * 6cm * 3√3 cm = 9√3 cm2.

So his remuneration under the new scheme would be: 0.025(x-4000) + 900 And we know that this is Rs. 600 more than his remuneration under the previous scheme, which was 0.05x. So we can set up an equation: 0.025(x-4000) + 900 = 0.05x + 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.025x - 100 + 900 = 0.05x + 600 0.025x + 800 = 0.05x + 600 0.025x = 200 x = 8000 Therefore, his sales were worth Rs. 8,000.

The first puncture can make the tyre flat in 9 minutes, which means it can make the tyre lose 4 units of air per minute (36/9). Similarly, the second puncture can make the tyre flat in 4 minutes, which means it can make the tyre lose 9 units of air per minute (36/4). Now, let's assume that both punctures are working together. Let's say the time taken for both punctures to make the tyre flat is 't' minutes. So, in 't' minutes, the first puncture would have made the tyre lose 4t units of air and the second puncture would have made the tyre lose 9t units of air. Since both punctures are working together, the total air lost in 't' minutes would be 4t + 9t = 13t. We know that the tyre has a capacity of 36 units of air.

Then, we know that the average age is increased by 2 years, so the new average age is \"x+2\". Next, we replace two men with two women. Let's call the ages of the two women \"a\" and \"b\". We know that the total age of the 8 men is 8x, and the total age of the 2 men we are replacing is 20+24=44. So, the total age of the 6 remaining men is 8x-44. When we add the ages of the two women, the total age becomes (8x-44)+a+b. We want to find the new average age, so we need to divide this total age by the new number of people, which is 8 (since we still have 8 people, just with 2 women instead of 2 men). So, the new average age is [(8x-44)+a+b]/8. We want to simplify this expression and solve for the average age of the two women, so let's start by distributing the division: [(8x-44)+a+b]/8 = (8x-44)/8 + (a+b)/8 We know that the first term on the right side is the new average age of the 6 remaining men, which is x+2. So, we can substitute that in: (x+2) + (a+b)/8 = x+2 Now we can solve for (a+b)/8: (a+b)/8 = 0 This means that the sum of the ages of the two women is 0, which is impossible.

The sum of all even integers from 2 to 400 can be found using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = (n/2)(a + l) where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term. In this case, a = 2, l = 400, and n = (400 - 2)/2 + 1 = 200. So, we have: S1 = (200/2)(2 + 400) = 40200 Next, we need to find the sum of all even integers from 2 to 300.

According to the problem, the height of the first high-rise is 37 feet taller than the second high-rise. Therefore, the height of the first high-rise is (z+37) feet. The sum of the heights of both high-rises is x feet. Therefore, we can write an equation as: z + (z+37) = x Simplifying the equation: 2z + 37 = x Subtracting 37 from both sides: 2z = x - 37 Dividing both sides by 2: z = (x-37)/2 Therefore, the height of the second high-rise will be (x-37)/2 feet. Hence, the correct answer is (A) (x-37).",

We also know that the distance between A and B is 600 km. So, we can set up the equation: 50x + 40x = 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 90x = 600 x = 6.67 hours Now that we know they meet after 6.67 hours, we can find out how far each of them has traveled: A: 50 km/h x 6.67 h = 333.33 km B: 40 km/h x 6.67 h = 266.67 km The total distance they have traveled is: 333.33 km + 266.67 km = 600 km Therefore, the answer is (B) 600 km.",

So, we can set up the equation: 10% of the investment = Rs. 650 0.1 x investment = 650 investment = 650 / 0.1 investment = Rs. 6,500 Now, we need to find out how many shares can be bought with an investment of Rs. 6,500 at Rs. 96 per share. Number of shares = investment / share price Number of shares = 6,500 / 96 Number of shares = 67.71 (approx.) Since we cannot buy a fraction of a share, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

When the store clerk reaches in to draw two individual gloves simultaneously and at random, there are a total of 20 gloves in the bag. To calculate the probability of drawing two gloves of the same color, we need to first calculate the total number of possible outcomes. The total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to choose 2 gloves out of 20, which is: 20 choose 2 = (20 * 19) / (2 * 1) = 190 Next, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to choose 2 gloves of the same color. There are 10 different colors to choose from, so the number of ways to choose 2 gloves of the same color is: 10 choose 1 = 10 For each color, there are 2 gloves to choose from, so the total number of ways to choose 2 gloves of the same color is: 10 * (2 choose 2) = 10 Therefore, the probability of drawing two gloves of the same color is: 10 / 190 = 1/19 So the correct answer is (E) 1/19.",

We know that the first train takes 10 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/10 = 12 m/s. Similarly, the second train takes 15 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/15 = 8 m/s.

But the shopkeeper uses a faulty meter that weighs 800 grams instead of 1 kilogram (1000 grams). So, the customer gets only 800 grams of goods for the price of 1 kilogram. To find the selling price of 1 kilogram of goods, we can use the formula: Selling price = Cost price / (Weight of goods / Weight sold) Selling price = 100 / (1000 / 800) = $80 So, the shopkeeper is selling 1 kilogram of goods at $80, which is the cost price of 800 grams of goods. Now, let's calculate the profit percent: Profit = Selling price - Cost price = $80 - $100 = -$20 The profit is negative because the shopkeeper is selling the goods at cost price.

Solving for J, we get: J = 18/(k-8) Since J is a positive integer, k-8 must be a factor of 18. The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. We can try each of these values for k and see which ones give us a positive integer value for J. For k=9, we get J = 18/(9-8) = 18, which is a positive integer. This is our answer. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 22.",

The ration of the number of boys to the number of girls in the class is: Answer Choices: (A) 2:5 (B) 2:3 (C) 2:4 (D) 2:1 (E) 2:9",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. Let the number of boys in the class be 'b' and the number of girls be 'g'. We know that the average age of the class is 15.8 years. So, the total age of all the students in the class = 15.8 x (b+g) We also know that the average age of boys in the class is 16.4 years. So, the total age of all the boys in the class = 16.4 x b Similarly, the total age of all the girls in the class = 15.4 x g Now, we can form an equation using the above information: (16.4 x b + 15.4 x g) / (b+g) = 15.8 Simplifying this equation, we get: 16.4b + 15.4g = 15.8b + 15.8g 0.6b = 0.4g b/g = 2/3 Therefore, the ratio of the number of boys to the number of girls in the class is 2:3. Hence, the correct answer is option (B) 2:3.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. There are 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice, as each die has 6 possible outcomes. To get a sum of 3, the only possible outcomes are (1,2) and (2,1). Therefore, there are only 2 favorable outcomes out of 36 possible outcomes. So, the probability of getting a sum of 3 is 2/36, which simplifies to 1/18. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) d) 1/18.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the selling price of one apple is $1. Therefore, the selling price of 300 apples is $300 and the selling price of 60 apples is $60. The seller gains the selling price of 60 apples, which is $60. Profit percent = (Profit/Cost Price) x 100 Here, the profit is $60 and the cost price is the selling price of 240 apples (300-60), which is $240. Profit percent = (60/240) x 100 = 25% Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 25.",
