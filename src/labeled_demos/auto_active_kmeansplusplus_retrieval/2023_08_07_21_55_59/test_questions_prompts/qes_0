  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Ben has 8 apples more than Phillip does. Tom has three eighths as many apples at Ben has. If Phillip has 40 apples, how many apples does Tom have?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nBen has 40+8 = <<40+8=48>>48 apples.\nThere are 48/8 = <<48/8=6>>6 apples in every eighth.\nTom has 6*3 = <<6*3=18>>18 apples. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: There have been 15 \"Where's Waldo?\" books published. Each book has 30 puzzles to find Waldo. The average person takes 3 minutes to find Waldo in a puzzle. How long would it take to find every Waldo?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThere have been 450 puzzles because 15 x 30 = <<450=450>>450\nIt would take 1,350 minutes to find all the Waldo's because 450 x 3 = <<450*3=1350>>1,350 The answer is 1350.\n\n\nQ: Stefan goes to a restaurant to eat dinner with his family. They order an appetizer that costs $10 and 4 entrees that are $20 each. If they tip 20% of the total for the waiter, what is the total amount of money that they spend at the restaurant?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe total cost of the entrees is 4 * $20 = $<<4*20=80>>80.\nThe total cost of the dinner is $80 + $10 = $<<80+10=90>>90.\nThe tip is $90 * 0.20 = $<<90*0.20=18>>18\nThe total cost with tip is $90 + $18 = $<<90+18=108>>108 The answer is 108.\n\n\nQ: A portable battery charger can fully charge a smartphone in 26 minutes or a tablet in 53 minutes. Ana charged her tablet fully and her phone halfway. How many minutes did it take?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nAna charged her phone halfway, so she took 26 / 2 = <<26/2=13>>13 minutes to charge her phone.\nThus, it took Ana 13 + 53 = <<13+53=66>>66 minutes to charge her phone and tablet. The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: The gauge on a water tank shows that the tank is 1/3 full of water. To fill the tank, 16 gallons of water are added. How many gallons of water does the tank hold when full?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nGiven that the tank is 1/3 full of water, and that it requires 16 gallons to fill. 1 full tank -1/3 tank = 2/3 of the tank is empty, which is equal to 16 gallons.\nIf 2/3 of the tank equals 16 gallons, this means 1/3 of the tank is equal to 16 / 2 gallons = 8 gallons\nThe total capacity of the tank or how much the tanks holds = 16 + 8 = <<16+8=24>>24 gallons The answer is 24.\n\n\n"
