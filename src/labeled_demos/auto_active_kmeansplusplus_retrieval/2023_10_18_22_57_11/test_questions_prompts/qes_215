  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Marie, the confectioner, makes 12 chocolate eggs, each weighing 10 ounces. She then packs an equal number of the eggs in 4 different gift boxes. Unfortunately, she leaves one of the boxes by the kitchen window and the afternoon sun melts everything. She tosses that box out. What is the total weight, in ounces, of the remaining chocolate eggs?\nA: Let's think step by step. Marie makes 12 chocolate eggs, each weighing 10 ounces. So the total weight of all the eggs is: 12 x 10 = 120 ounces Marie packs an equal number of eggs in 4 different gift boxes. So each box contains: 120 / 4 = 30 ounces But one of the boxes is tossed out, so we need to subtract the weight of that box from the total weight of the eggs. Therefore, the total weight of the remaining chocolate eggs is: (3 boxes) x (30 ounces per box) = 90 ounces The answer is 90.\n\n\nQ: A cake of 400 grams is divided into eight equal parts. Nathalie eats one-eighth of the cake, and Pierre eats double what Nathalie ate. How much did Pierre eat, in grams?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much one-eighth of the cake weighs. We can do this by dividing the weight of the cake (400 grams) by 8: 400 \u00f7 8 = 50 So one-eighth of the cake weighs 50 grams. Next, we need to find out how much Pierre ate, which is double what Nathalie ate. We can do this by multiplying Nathalie's portion (50 grams) by 2: 50 \u00d7 2 = 100 Therefore, Pierre ate 100 grams of the cake. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Ella has 4 bags with 20 apples in each bag and six bags with 25 apples in each bag. If Ella sells 200 apples, how many apples does Ella has left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many apples Ella has in total. She has 4 bags with 20 apples in each bag, so that's 4 x 20 = 80 apples. She also has 6 bags with 25 apples in each bag, so that's 6 x 25 = 150 apples. In total, Ella has 80 + 150 = 230 apples. If she sells 200 apples, we can subtract that from the total: 230 - 200 = 30 Therefore, Ella has 30 apples left. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: Jacque arrived in France and his suitcase weighed 5 pounds.  While in France, he picked up 5 bottles of perfume that weighed 1.2 ounces each, 4 pounds of chocolate, 2 bars of soap that weighed 5 ounces each and 2 jars of jam that weighed 8 ounces each.  Considering 16 ounces is the same as 1 pound, how much did Jacque's suitcase weigh on the return flight home?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the weight of the perfume bottles from ounces to pounds. Since 16 ounces is equal to 1 pound, we can divide 1.2 ounces by 16 to get the weight of one bottle in pounds: 1.2 ounces \u00f7 16 = 0.075 pounds Since Jacque picked up 5 bottles, we can multiply the weight of one bottle by 5 to get the total weight of the perfume: 0.075 pounds/bottle x 5 bottles = 0.375 pounds Next, we need to add the weight of the chocolate, soap, and jam in pounds: 4 pounds (chocolate) + 0.625 pounds (soap and jam) = 4.625 pounds Finally, we can add the weight of the perfume and the other items to the weight of Jacque's suitcase when he arrived in France: 5 pounds (suitcase) + 0.375 pounds (perfume) + 4.625 pounds (chocolate, soap, and jam) = 10 pounds Therefore, Jacque's suitcase weighed 10 pounds on the return flight home. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Harry uses a whole bag of chocolate chips when he makes dough for chocolate chip cookies. The dough makes three batches of cookies, and each cookie has nine chocolate chips in it. A bag of chocolate chips has 81 chips in it. How many cookies are in a batch?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Harry uses a whole bag of chocolate chips for three batches of cookies. So, we can divide the number of chips in a bag by 3 to find out how many chips are in each batch: 81 chips / 3 batches = 27 chips per batch Next, we know that each cookie has 9 chocolate chips in it. So, we can divide the number of chips per batch by 9 to find out how many cookies are in each batch: 27 chips per batch / 9 chips per cookie = 3 cookies per batch Therefore, there are 3 cookies in each batch. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Yvonne brings a box of chocolates to school. Half have nuts and half do not. The students eat 80% of the ones with nuts and eat half of the ones without nuts. If there are 28 chocolates left, how many chocolates were in the box?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that there were x chocolates in the box. Since half of them have nuts and half do not, we can say that there were x/2 chocolates with nuts and x/2 chocolates without nuts. Now, we know that the students ate 80% of the chocolates with nuts, which means they ate 0.8(x/2) = 0.4x chocolates with nuts. They also ate half of the chocolates without nuts, which means they ate 0.5(x/2) = 0.25x chocolates without nuts. In total, the students ate 0.4x + 0.25x = 0.65x chocolates. If there are 28 chocolates left, that means the students ate x - 28 chocolates. So we can set up the equation: 0.65x = x - 28 Solving for x: 0.35x = 28 x = 80 Therefore, there were 80 chocolates in the box. The answer is 80.\n\n\nQ: James takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces.  He splits the pieces between 4 people.  If an orange has 80 calories how many calories does each person get?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pieces James has in total. He takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces, so he has 5 x 8 = 40 pieces in total. Next, we need to divide the pieces between 4 people. To do this, we can divide the total number of pieces by 4: 40 \u00f7 4 = 10 pieces per person. Finally, we need to find out how many calories each person gets. We know that one orange has 80 calories, so each piece has 80 \u00f7 8 = 10 calories. Therefore, each person gets 10 x 10 = 100 calories. So each person gets 100 calories. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Paul has five dogs. For every 10 pounds they weigh, they need 1 pound of dog food per day. One weighs 20 pounds. One weighs 40. Another weighs 10. One weighs 30 and the final one weighs 50 pounds. How much dog food does he need each day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total weight of all five dogs. Total weight = 20 + 40 + 10 + 30 + 50 = 150 pounds Next, we need to calculate how much dog food is needed per day for every 10 pounds of weight. 1 pound of dog food is needed for every 10 pounds of weight So, for 150 pounds of weight, we need: 150/10 = 15 pounds of dog food per day Therefore, Paul needs 15 pounds of dog food each day to feed his five dogs. The answer is 15.\n\n\n"
