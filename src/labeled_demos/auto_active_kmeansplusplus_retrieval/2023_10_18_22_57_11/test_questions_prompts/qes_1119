  "formatted_prompt": "Q: To make fried green tomatoes, Thelma cuts each green tomato into 8 slices before cooking them up.  If 20 slices of fried green tomato make a meal for a single person, how many tomatoes will Thelma need to make enough fried green tomatoes to feed a family of 8 for a single meal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many slices of fried green tomatoes are needed for a family of 8 for a single meal. We know that 20 slices make a meal for a single person, so for 8 people, we need: 20 slices/person x 8 people = 160 slices Next, we need to figure out how many tomatoes are needed to make 160 slices. We know that Thelma cuts each tomato into 8 slices, so: 160 slices \u00f7 8 slices/tomato = 20 tomatoes Therefore, Thelma will need 20 tomatoes to make enough fried green tomatoes to feed a family of 8 for a single meal. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Marly is making soup. He adds 2 quarts of milk and three times as much chicken stock to 1 quart of pureed vegetables. Then he divides the soup into bags that can hold 3 quarts each. How many bags does he need?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Marly adds 2 quarts of milk and three times as much chicken stock to 1 quart of pureed vegetables. This means he adds 2 + 3(1) = 5 quarts of liquid to the vegetables. Next, Marly has a total of 5 + 1 = 6 quarts of soup. To find out how many bags he needs, we need to divide the total amount of soup by the amount each bag can hold. So, we have: 6 quarts \u00f7 3 quarts/bag = 2 bags Therefore, Marly needs 2 bags to hold all of his soup. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: A tomato plant has 100 tomatoes. Jane picks 1/4 of that number for use in their house. After a week, she goes back and picks 20 more tomatoes, and the following week picks twice that number. What's the total number of fruits remaining on the tomato plant?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Jane picks 1/4 of 100 tomatoes, which is 25 tomatoes. So, there are 100 - 25 = 75 tomatoes left on the plant. After a week, Jane picks 20 more tomatoes, so there are 75 - 20 = 55 tomatoes left on the plant. The following week, Jane picks twice the number of tomatoes she picked the previous week, which is 2 * 20 = 40 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes Jane picked is 25 + 20 + 40 = 85 tomatoes. The total number of tomatoes remaining on the plant is 100 - 85 = 15 tomatoes. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: There are 10 bags with 30 oranges each on a truck. A total of 50 pieces of oranges are rotten. Thirty pieces of oranges will be kept for making orange juice and the rest will be sold. How many pieces of oranges will be sold?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of oranges in the 10 bags. 10 bags x 30 oranges/bag = 300 oranges Next, we need to subtract the number of rotten oranges. 300 oranges - 50 rotten oranges = 250 good oranges Now, we know that 30 oranges will be kept for making juice. 250 good oranges - 30 oranges for juice = 220 oranges to be sold Therefore, 220 pieces of oranges will be sold. The answer is 220.\n\n\nQ: Claudia has 122 ounces of water and is filling up cups. She has 8-ounce glasses, 5-ounce glasses, and 4-ounce glasses. If she fills six 5 ounce glasses and four 8 ounce glasses, how many 4 ounce glasses can she fill with the remaining water?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much water Claudia has used so far. 6 x 5 = 30 ounces (for six 5-ounce glasses) 4 x 8 = 32 ounces (for four 8-ounce glasses) So, Claudia has used 30 + 32 = 62 ounces of water. Now, let's calculate how much water she has left. 122 - 62 = 60 ounces Finally, let's calculate how many 4-ounce glasses she can fill with the remaining water. 60 / 4 = 15 Therefore, Claudia can fill 15 4-ounce glasses with the remaining water. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: One serving of soup has 1 cup of vegetables and 2.5 cups of broth. How many pints of vegetables and broth combined would be needed for 8 servings?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total amount of soup in cups for 8 servings. One serving has 1 cup of vegetables and 2.5 cups of broth, so one serving of soup is 1 + 2.5 = 3.5 cups. To find the total amount of soup for 8 servings, we can multiply the amount for one serving by 8: 3.5 cups/serving x 8 servings = 28 cups of soup Now we need to find the amount of pints in 28 cups. There are 2 cups in a pint, so we can divide 28 cups by 2 to get the amount in pints: 28 cups \u00f7 2 cups/pint = 14 pints Therefore, we would need 14 pints of vegetables and broth combined for 8 servings of soup. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Cassandra bought four dozen Granny Smith apples and used them to make four apple pies.  She cut each pie into 6 large pieces.  How many apples are in each slice of pie?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Determine the total number of apples Cassandra bought. - One dozen is equal to 12, so four dozen is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 apples. Step 2: Determine the total number of pieces of pie Cassandra made. - Each pie was cut into 6 pieces, so four pies would be cut into 4 x 6 = 24 pieces. Step 3: Determine the number of apples in each slice of pie. - To do this, we need to divide the total number of apples by the total number of pieces of pie. - 48 apples / 24 pieces = 2 apples per slice of pie. Therefore, there are 2 apples in each slice of pie. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: There were 90 jellybeans in a jar. Samantha snuck 24 jellybeans out of the jar, without being seen. Shelby ate 12 jellybeans from the jar. Their mom, Shannon, refilled the jar with half as much as Samantha and Shelby took out. How many jellybeans are in the jar now?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Samantha took out 24 jellybeans from the jar. Step 2: Shelby ate 12 jellybeans from the jar. Step 3: The total number of jellybeans taken out of the jar is 24 + 12 = 36. Step 4: Shannon refilled the jar with half as much as Samantha and Shelby took out, which is 1/2 * 36 = 18 jellybeans. Step 5: The total number of jellybeans in the jar now is 90 - 36 + 18 = 72 jellybeans. Therefore, there are 72 jellybeans in the jar now. The answer is 72.\n\n\n"
