  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Seth lost 17.5 pounds. Jerome lost three times that many pounds and Veronica lost 1.5 pounds more than Seth. How many pounds did the 3 people lose in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Seth lost 17.5 pounds. Next, we need to find out how much weight Jerome lost. We are told that Jerome lost three times as much weight as Seth, so we can multiply Seth's weight loss by 3: 17.5 x 3 = 52.5 So Jerome lost 52.5 pounds. Finally, we need to find out how much weight Veronica lost. We are told that she lost 1.5 pounds more than Seth, so we can add 1.5 to Seth's weight loss: 17.5 + 1.5 = 19 So Veronica lost 19 pounds. To find the total weight loss for all three people, we can add up their individual weight losses: 17.5 + 52.5 + 19 = 89 Therefore, the three people lost a total of 89 pounds. The answer is 89.\n\n\nQ: Paul has five dogs. For every 10 pounds they weigh, they need 1 pound of dog food per day. One weighs 20 pounds. One weighs 40. Another weighs 10. One weighs 30 and the final one weighs 50 pounds. How much dog food does he need each day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total weight of all five dogs. Total weight = 20 + 40 + 10 + 30 + 50 = 150 pounds Next, we need to calculate how much dog food is needed per day for every 10 pounds of weight. 1 pound of dog food is needed for every 10 pounds of weight So, for 150 pounds of weight, we need: 150/10 = 15 pounds of dog food per day Therefore, Paul needs 15 pounds of dog food each day to feed his five dogs. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Arthur has 3 dogs. They eat an average of 15 pounds of food a week. One dog eats 13 pounds a week. The second eats double this. How much does the third dog eat a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the total amount of food the three dogs eat in a week is 15 pounds per dog * 3 dogs = 45 pounds. Next, we know that one of the dogs eats 13 pounds per week. So, the other two dogs must eat a total of 45 pounds - 13 pounds = 32 pounds per week. We also know that the second dog eats double what the first dog eats, which is 13 pounds. So, the second dog eats 2 * 13 pounds = 26 pounds per week. To find out how much the third dog eats, we can subtract the amount the first and second dogs eat from the total amount of food the three dogs eat: 45 pounds - 13 pounds - 26 pounds = 6 pounds Therefore, the third dog eats 6 pounds of food per week. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of 18 watermelons. Since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, the total weight of 18 watermelons would be: 23 x 18 = 414 pounds Next, we need to find the total amount of money Farmer Kent would make by selling these watermelons. Since he sells them for $2 a pound, we can multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 414 x $2 = $828 Therefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Emily goes fishing and has a very busy day. She catches 4 trout, 3 catfish, and 5 bluegills. If the trout weigh 2 pounds each, the catfish weigh 1.5 pounds each, and the bluegills weigh 2.5 pounds each, how many total pounds of fish did she catch?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total weight of the trout. Emily caught 4 trout, and each trout weighs 2 pounds, so the total weight of the trout is: 4 trout x 2 pounds/trout = 8 pounds Next, we need to calculate the total weight of the catfish. Emily caught 3 catfish, and each catfish weighs 1.5 pounds, so the total weight of the catfish is: 3 catfish x 1.5 pounds/catfish = 4.5 pounds Finally, we need to calculate the total weight of the bluegills. Emily caught 5 bluegills, and each bluegill weighs 2.5 pounds, so the total weight of the bluegills is: 5 bluegills x 2.5 pounds/bluegill = 12.5 pounds Now, we can add up the weight of all the fish to find the total weight: 8 pounds + 4.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds = 25 pounds Therefore, Emily caught a total of 25 pounds of fish. The answer is 25.\n\n\nQ: Parker went to the gym and found 4 twenty pounds dumbbells set up for weightlifting. He added two more dumbbells to the setup and started his exercises. How many pounds of dumbbells is Parker using for his exercises?\nA: Let's think step by step. Parker started with 4 twenty pounds dumbbells, which means he was using 4 x 20 = 80 pounds of dumbbells for his exercises. Then he added two more dumbbells, but we don't know how much each of them weighs. Let's call the weight of each new dumbbell \"x\". So now Parker is using a total of (4 + 2) dumbbells, which is 6 dumbbells in total. The weight of each dumbbell is either 20 pounds (the original ones) or x pounds (the new ones). Therefore, the total weight of dumbbells that Parker is using for his exercises is: 80 + 2x We don't know the value of x, so we can't calculate the exact weight. But we do know that it's at least 20 pounds (since the original dumbbells were 20 pounds each). The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Betty has 20 books, and her sister has 1/4 times more books than Betty. What's the total number of books the two have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many books Betty's sister has. To do this, we can take 1/4 of Betty's number of books and add it to Betty's number of books. 1/4 of 20 books is (1/4) x 20 = 5 books. So Betty's sister has 20 + 5 = 25 books. To find the total number of books the two have, we can add Betty's number of books to her sister's number of books: 20 + 25 = 45 books. Therefore, the two sisters have a total of 45 books. The answer is 45.\n\n\nQ: Mary bought a packet of 1500 stickers. She shared them between Susan, Andrew and Sam in the ratio 1:1:3 respectively. If Sam gave Andrew two-thirds of his own share, how many stickers does Andrew now have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 1+1+3=5. Next, we need to find the size of each part by dividing the total number of stickers by the total number of parts: 1500/5=300. So, Susan and Andrew each get one part, which is 300 stickers each. Sam gets three parts, which is 900 stickers. Now, we need to find out how many stickers Sam gave to Andrew. Two-thirds of Sam's share is (2/3)*900=600. Therefore, Andrew now has 300+600=900 stickers. The answer is 900.\n\n\n"
