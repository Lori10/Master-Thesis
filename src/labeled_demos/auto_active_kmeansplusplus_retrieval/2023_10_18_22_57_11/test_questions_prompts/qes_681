  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Brenda volunteered to make 3 trays of banana pudding for the family reunion.  Each tray of banana pudding would need 80 wafer cookies.  A box of wafer cookies only had 60 cookies per box.  Each box costs $3.50.  How much will it cost her to buy just enough boxes for 3 trays of banana pudding?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many wafer cookies Brenda needs in total. She needs 80 cookies per tray and she's making 3 trays, so she needs: 80 x 3 = 240 wafer cookies Next, we need to figure out how many boxes of cookies she needs to buy. Each box has 60 cookies, so we can divide the total number of cookies needed by the number of cookies per box: 240 \u00f7 60 = 4 boxes So Brenda needs to buy 4 boxes of cookies. Each box costs $3.50, so we can multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box: 4 x $3.50 = $14 Therefore, it will cost Brenda $14 to buy just enough boxes for 3 trays of banana pudding. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Chad is hosting a BBQ on the hottest day of the year, where there will be a total of 15 people.  He will need 2 pounds of ice per person to account for the heat.  One pound bags of ice are sold for $3.00 for a pack of 10.  How much will he spend on ice?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pounds of ice Chad will need in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of people by the amount of ice needed per person: 15 people x 2 pounds/person = 30 pounds of ice Next, we need to figure out how many packs of ice Chad will need to buy. Since each pack contains 10 one-pound bags of ice, we can divide the total pounds needed by 10: 30 pounds of ice \u00f7 10 bags/pack = 3 packs of ice Finally, we can calculate the total cost of the ice by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack: 3 packs x $3.00/pack = $9.00 Therefore, Chad will spend $9.00 on ice for his BBQ. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Five people are planning a party. Sonja will buy a loaf of French bread ($3 a loaf) and a platter of cold cuts ($23). Barbara will buy the soda ($1 per person) and two boxes of crackers ($2 per box). Mario and Rick will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles ($3 per package). Danica will supply a package of paper plates for $4. How much more will Sonja spend than the rest of the office put together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of Barbara's contribution. She will buy soda for 5 people, which will cost $5 (1 dollar per person). She will also buy two boxes of crackers, which will cost $4 (2 dollars per box). Therefore, Barbara's total contribution will be $9. Next, let's calculate the total cost of Mario and Rick's contribution. They will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles, which will cost $6 in total (3 dollars per package). Now, let's add up the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's. Barbara's contribution is $9, Mario and Rick's contribution is $6, and Danica's contribution is $4. Therefore, the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's is $19. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of Sonja's contribution. She will buy a loaf of French bread for $3 and a platter of cold cuts for $23. Therefore, Sonja's total contribution will be $26. To find out how much more Sonja will spend than the rest of the office put together, we need to subtract the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's from Sonja's total contribution. $26 (Sonja's contribution) - $19 (total cost of everyone else's contribution) = $7 Therefore, Sonja will spend $7 more than the rest of the office put together. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: A gallon of whole milk that normally costs $3 is now sold at $2. A box of cereal was sold at a discount of $1. How much will you save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the discount for each gallon of whole milk. The discount is $3 - $2 = $1 per gallon. So, if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk, you will save 3 x $1 = $3. Next, let's calculate the discount for each box of cereal. The discount is $1 per box. So, if you buy 5 boxes of cereal, you will save 5 x $1 = $5. Therefore, the total amount you will save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal is $3 + $5 = $8. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Marie, the confectioner, makes 12 chocolate eggs, each weighing 10 ounces. She then packs an equal number of the eggs in 4 different gift boxes. Unfortunately, she leaves one of the boxes by the kitchen window and the afternoon sun melts everything. She tosses that box out. What is the total weight, in ounces, of the remaining chocolate eggs?\nA: Let's think step by step. Marie makes 12 chocolate eggs, each weighing 10 ounces. So the total weight of all the eggs is: 12 x 10 = 120 ounces Marie packs an equal number of eggs in 4 different gift boxes. So each box contains: 120 / 4 = 30 ounces But one of the boxes is tossed out, so we need to subtract the weight of that box from the total weight of the eggs. Therefore, the total weight of the remaining chocolate eggs is: (3 boxes) x (30 ounces per box) = 90 ounces The answer is 90.\n\n\nQ: Martha needs 4 cups of berries and 2 cups of heavy cream to make 1 quart of ice cream.  She wants to make 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream.  At the farmers market, the 2 cup packages of strawberries are $3.00 each and the 2 cup package of raspberries are $5.00 each.  The heavy cream is sold for $4.00 for a 4 cup container.  How much will it cost her to make 1 quart of each ice cream?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how many packages of strawberries and raspberries Martha needs to make 1 quart of each ice cream. Since she needs 4 cups of berries for 1 quart of ice cream, and each package contains 2 cups, she will need 2 packages of strawberries and 2 packages of raspberries for both quarts of ice cream. The cost of the strawberries will be 2 packages x $3.00 per package = $6.00 for 1 quart of strawberry ice cream. The cost of the raspberries will be 2 packages x $5.00 per package = $10.00 for 1 quart of raspberry ice cream. Next, we need to calculate the cost of the heavy cream. Martha needs 2 cups of heavy cream for 1 quart of ice cream, so she will need 4 cups of heavy cream for both quarts of ice cream. The cost of the heavy cream is $4.00 for a 4 cup container, so it will cost $4.00 for both quarts of ice cream. Therefore, the total cost of making 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream is: $6.00 (strawberries) + $10.00 (raspberries) + $4.00 (heavy cream) = $20.00 The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: 1 chocolate bar costs $1.50 and can be broken into 3 sections to make 3 s'mores.  Ron is hosting a boy scout camp out in his backyard for 15 scouts.  He wants to make sure that there are enough chocolate bars for everyone to have 2 s'mores each.  How much will he spend on chocolate bars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how many s'mores Ron needs to make in total. Since there are 15 scouts and each scout needs 2 s'mores, Ron needs to make 15 x 2 = 30 s'mores in total. Next, we need to calculate how many chocolate bars Ron needs to buy. Since each chocolate bar can make 3 s'mores, Ron needs to buy 30/3 = 10 chocolate bars. Finally, we need to calculate how much Ron will spend on chocolate bars. Since each chocolate bar costs $1.50, Ron will spend 10 x $1.50 = $15 on chocolate bars. Therefore, Ron will spend $15 on chocolate bars to make sure that there are enough for everyone to have 2 s'mores each. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Oliver has 4 friends that he is inviting to a party at the arcade. Game tokens cost 30 for $1. Each game costs 2 tokens. If he wants all his friends to get to play 60 games each, how much will it cost?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how many games in total Oliver's friends will play. Since each friend will play 60 games, and Oliver has 4 friends, the total number of games played will be: 60 games/friend * 4 friends = 240 games Next, we need to calculate how many tokens are needed for 240 games. Since each game costs 2 tokens, the total number of tokens needed will be: 240 games * 2 tokens/game = 480 tokens Finally, we need to calculate how much it will cost to buy 480 tokens. Since 30 tokens cost $1, we can calculate the cost of 480 tokens as follows: 480 tokens / 30 tokens/$1 = $16 Therefore, it will cost $16 to buy enough tokens for Oliver and his friends to play 60 games each at the arcade. The answer is 60.\n\n\n"
