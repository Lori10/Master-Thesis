  "test_question": "Q: It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.  It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees.  After warming the oil it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.  How much time passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A charcoal grill burns fifteen coals to ash every twenty minutes of grilling. The grill ran for long enough to burn three bags of coals. Each bag of coal contains 60 coals. How long did the grill run?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many coals were burned in total. Since each bag contains 60 coals, and there were three bags, the total number of coals burned is: 60 coals/bag * 3 bags = 180 coals Next, we need to figure out how many sets of 15 coals were burned. We can do this by dividing the total number of coals burned by 15: 180 coals / 15 coals/set = 12 sets So, the grill burned 15 coals every 20 minutes, and it burned 12 sets of 15 coals, which means it ran for: 12 sets * 20 minutes/set = 240 minutes Therefore, the grill ran for 240 minutes or 4 hours. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Steph needs to cook fried chicken for the kid's party. She bought 24 pieces of drumstick and 4 fewer breast parts. How many fried chickens can Steph make?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Determine the number of breast parts that Steph bought. If Steph bought 4 fewer breast parts than drumsticks, then the number of breast parts she bought is 24 - 4 = 20. Step 2: Calculate the total number of fried chickens that Steph can make. Since Steph has 24 drumsticks and 20 breast parts, she can make a total of 24 + 20 = 44 fried chickens. Therefore, Steph can make 44 fried chickens for the kid's party. The answer is 44.\n\n\nQ: Martin owns a farm with hens. 10 hens do lay 80 eggs in 10 days. Martin decided to buy 15 more hens. How many eggs will all hens lay in 15 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many eggs one hen lays in 10 days. We can do this by dividing the total number of eggs laid by 10 hens by 10 days: 80 eggs \u00f7 10 hens \u00f7 10 days = 0.8 eggs per hen per day Now that we know how many eggs one hen lays per day, we can find out how many eggs all 25 hens will lay in 15 days: 25 hens \u00d7 0.8 eggs per hen per day \u00d7 15 days = 300 eggs Therefore, all 25 hens will lay 300 eggs in 15 days. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Wallace runs a beef jerky company. The company dries the jerky low and slow, so one batch of jerky takes all night to make. Each batch can make 10 bags of jerky. Wallace received a customer order for 60 bags of jerky. If he has 20 bags of jerky already made, how many days will it be before he can fulfill the customer\u2019s order?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many batches of jerky Wallace needs to make to fulfill the customer's order. To do this, we can use division: 60 (total bags needed) - 20 (bags already made) = 40 (bags still needed) 40 bags \u00f7 10 bags per batch = 4 batches needed So Wallace needs to make 4 batches of jerky to fulfill the customer's order. Next, we need to figure out how many days it will take to make those 4 batches. We know that one batch takes all night to make, so we can assume that it takes approximately 8 hours. 4 batches x 8 hours per batch = 32 hours Therefore, it will take Wallace 32 hours to make the 4 batches of jerky needed to fulfill the customer's order. If Wallace works 8 hours a day, it will take him 4 days to make the jerky. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: It takes Omar 12 minutes to raise his kite 240 feet into the air. Jasper can raise his kite at three times the rate of speed as Omar can raise his kite. If Jasper raises his kite to a height of 600 feet, how many minutes will it take?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Jasper to raise his kite to a height of 240 feet, like Omar did. We know that Omar takes 12 minutes to raise his kite 240 feet, so we can set up a proportion: 12 minutes / 240 feet = x minutes / 600 feet To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 12 minutes * 600 feet = 240 feet * x minutes 7200 = 240x x = 30 So it would take Jasper 30 minutes to raise his kite to a height of 600 feet. The answer is 600.\n\n\nQ: To make fried green tomatoes, Thelma cuts each green tomato into 8 slices before cooking them up.  If 20 slices of fried green tomato make a meal for a single person, how many tomatoes will Thelma need to make enough fried green tomatoes to feed a family of 8 for a single meal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many slices of fried green tomatoes are needed for a family of 8 for a single meal. We know that 20 slices make a meal for a single person, so for 8 people, we need: 20 slices/person x 8 people = 160 slices Next, we need to figure out how many tomatoes are needed to make 160 slices. We know that Thelma cuts each tomato into 8 slices, so: 160 slices \u00f7 8 slices/tomato = 20 tomatoes Therefore, Thelma will need 20 tomatoes to make enough fried green tomatoes to feed a family of 8 for a single meal. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Emery's family decides to travel for a weekend trip. They drive the first 100 miles in 1 hour. They stop at a McDonald's and then continue the rest of the journey for 300 miles. What's the total number of hours they traveled?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, they drove 100 miles in 1 hour. Then, they stopped at McDonald's, which we don't know how long it took. Finally, they continued the rest of the journey for 300 miles. So, the total distance they traveled is 100 + 300 = 400 miles. We know they drove the first 100 miles in 1 hour, but we don't know how long they stopped at McDonald's. Let's call that time \"x\". Then, they drove the remaining 300 miles. Let's call the time it took to drive that distance \"y\". So, the total time they traveled is: 1 hour (for the first 100 miles) + x (for the time they stopped at McDonald's) + y (for the remaining 300 miles) We don't know x or y, but we do know that the total time they traveled is the sum of those three values. Therefore, the answer is: Total time = 1 + x + y hours. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Marly is making soup. He adds 2 quarts of milk and three times as much chicken stock to 1 quart of pureed vegetables. Then he divides the soup into bags that can hold 3 quarts each. How many bags does he need?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Marly adds 2 quarts of milk and three times as much chicken stock to 1 quart of pureed vegetables. This means he adds 2 + 3(1) = 5 quarts of liquid to the vegetables. Next, Marly has a total of 5 + 1 = 6 quarts of soup. To find out how many bags he needs, we need to divide the total amount of soup by the amount each bag can hold. So, we have: 6 quarts \u00f7 3 quarts/bag = 2 bags Therefore, Marly needs 2 bags to hold all of his soup. The answer is 2.\n\n\n"
