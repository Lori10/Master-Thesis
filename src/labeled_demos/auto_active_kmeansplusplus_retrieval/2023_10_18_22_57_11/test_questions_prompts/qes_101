  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Darcy washes and drys 20 shirts and 8 pairs of shorts. If he folds 12 of the shirts and 5 of the shorts, how many more remaining pieces of clothing does Darcy have to fold?\nA: Let's think step by step. Darcy washes and dries a total of 20 + 8 = 28 pieces of clothing. He folds 12 shirts and 5 shorts, which is a total of 12 + 5 = 17 pieces of clothing. Therefore, Darcy has 28 - 17 = 11 pieces of clothing left to fold. The answer is 11.\n\n\nQ: Norma takes her clothes to the laundry. She leaves 9 T-shirts and twice as many sweaters as T-shirts in the washer. When she returns she finds 3 sweaters and triple the number of T-shirts. How many items are missing?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Norma left 9 T-shirts in the washer. Next, we know that she left twice as many sweaters as T-shirts in the washer. So, she left 2 x 9 = 18 sweaters in the washer. When she returns, she finds 3 sweaters and triple the number of T-shirts. So, she finds 3 sweaters + 3 x 9 = 30 T-shirts. To find out how many items are missing, we need to add up the total number of items that Norma left in the washer and subtract the total number of items that she found when she returned. Total items left in washer: 9 T-shirts + 18 sweaters = 27 items Total items found when she returned: 3 sweaters + 30 T-shirts = 33 items So, the number of items missing is: 33 - 27 = 6 items. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Frank's laundry detergent is double concentrated and will wash 80 loads of laundry.  His detergent is usually $25.00 a bottle but they're having a sale.  If he buys 2 bottles, both bottles will drop to $20.00 a bottle.  How much does he spend, in cents, per load of laundry, if he buys 2 bottles of detergent?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the cost of one bottle of detergent during the sale: $25.00 - $20.00 = $5.00 discount per bottle $25.00 - $5.00 = $20.00 per bottle during the sale Since Frank buys 2 bottles during the sale, he spends: 2 bottles x $20.00 per bottle = $40.00 Now, let's calculate the cost per load of laundry: $40.00 for 2 bottles x 80 loads per bottle = 160 loads $40.00 for 160 loads = $0.25 per load Therefore, Frank spends 25 cents per load of laundry if he buys 2 bottles of detergent during the sale. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Lucas wants to get a dog but his parents think he already has too many pets and won't have enough space. He already has 12 pet beds in his room but manages to fit another 8 pet beds. His parents argue that each pet is going to need 2 beds each to feel comfortable. According to his parent's argument, how many pets does Lucas have enough room for?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pet beds Lucas has in total after adding the 8 new ones. 12 + 8 = 20 pet beds Next, we need to divide the total number of pet beds by 2 to find out how many pets can be accommodated. 20 \u00f7 2 = 10 pets Therefore, according to his parent's argument, Lucas has enough room for 10 pets. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: Betsy is sewing a quilt.  The quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side.  Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together.  How many more squares does she need to sew together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many squares Betsy has already sewn together. If the quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side, then the total number of squares in the quilt is: 16 x 16 = 256 squares If Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together, then she has sewn: 0.25 x 256 = 64 squares Now we need to find out how many more squares she needs to sew together. To do this, we can subtract the number of squares she has already sewn from the total number of squares in the quilt: 256 - 64 = 192 squares So Betsy still needs to sew together 192 squares to complete the quilt. The answer is 192.\n\n\nQ: Ivan has 20 dice. Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. How many dice do they have altogether?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Ivan has 20 dice. Next, we know that Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. So, we can multiply Ivan's number of dice by 2 to find Jerry's number of dice: 20 x 2 = 40 Therefore, Jerry has 40 dice. To find the total number of dice they have altogether, we can add Ivan's and Jerry's number of dice: 20 + 40 = 60 Therefore, they have 60 dice altogether. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Ella has 4 bags with 20 apples in each bag and six bags with 25 apples in each bag. If Ella sells 200 apples, how many apples does Ella has left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many apples Ella has in total. She has 4 bags with 20 apples in each bag, so that's 4 x 20 = 80 apples. She also has 6 bags with 25 apples in each bag, so that's 6 x 25 = 150 apples. In total, Ella has 80 + 150 = 230 apples. If she sells 200 apples, we can subtract that from the total: 230 - 200 = 30 Therefore, Ella has 30 apples left. The answer is 30.\n\n\n"
