  "test_question": "Q: James buys a plane.  The plane cost $150,000.  He pays $5000 a month to rent a hanger to keep it in.  He also spends twice as much as that on fuel per month.  How much did it cost him to get and maintain the plane for the first year?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Jamie and Oliver are planning to go on a vacation. A plane ticket costs $24 for each person and a hotel stay costs $12 for each person per day. How much money will they spend on the vacation if they stay for 3 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets for both Jamie and Oliver. Since each ticket costs $24, the total cost of the tickets will be: $24 x 2 = $48 Next, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel stay. Since the cost is $12 per person per day, and they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel stay will be: $12 x 2 x 3 = $72 Finally, we need to add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay to get the total cost of the vacation: $48 + $72 = $120 Therefore, Jamie and Oliver will spend $120 on their vacation. The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: Logan makes $65,000 a year. He spends $20,000 on rent every year, $5000 on groceries every year, and $8000 on gas every year. If he wants to have at least $42000 left, how much more money must he make each year?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how much Logan spends in total each year: $20,000 (rent) + $5,000 (groceries) + $8,000 (gas) = $33,000 Next, we need to subtract that amount from his annual income: $65,000 (income) - $33,000 (expenses) = $32,000 So Logan currently has $32,000 left after paying his expenses. However, he wants to have at least $42,000 left. Therefore, we need to calculate how much more money he needs to make each year: $42,000 (desired savings) - $32,000 (current savings) = $10,000 Therefore, Logan needs to make at least $10,000 more each year to reach his desired savings goal. The answer is 10000.\n\n\nQ: Twenty people pre-bought plane tickets at a price of $155 per ticket. Thirty people bought their plane tickets at the gate and they each paid $200 for their ticket. How many more dollars did the people at the gate pay for their tickets than those passengers that pre-bought their tickets?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total cost of pre-bought tickets Twenty people pre-bought tickets at $155 per ticket, so the total cost is: 20 x $155 = $3100 Step 2: Find the total cost of tickets bought at the gate Thirty people bought tickets at $200 per ticket, so the total cost is: 30 x $200 = $6000 Step 3: Find the difference in cost between the two groups To find the difference, we subtract the total cost of pre-bought tickets from the total cost of tickets bought at the gate: $6000 - $3100 = $2900 Therefore, the people at the gate paid $2900 more for their tickets than those passengers that pre-bought their tickets. The answer is 2900.\n\n\nQ: Sarah wants to start a cupcake business and was approved for a business loan.  The loan has 0% interest if she pays the entire amount back in 5 years, which she decides to do.  If she put $10,000 down as a down payment and her monthly payments are $600.00, how much was her loan for (including the down payment)?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total number of months in 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 5 years would be 5 x 12 = 60 months. Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money Sarah will pay in monthly payments. She will pay $600 per month for 60 months, so the total amount of money she will pay is 600 x 60 = $36,000. Now, we can calculate the total cost of the loan, including the down payment. Sarah put $10,000 down, and she will pay $36,000 in monthly payments, so the total cost of the loan is $10,000 + $36,000 = $46,000. Therefore, Sarah's loan was for $46,000 (including the down payment). The answer is 46000.\n\n\nQ: Mitch has saved $20000 to finance his boating hobby. A new boat costs $1500 per foot in length. If Mitch needs to keep $500 for a license and registration, and three times that amount for docking fees, how many feet is the longest boat he can buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to subtract the amount Mitch needs to keep for license and registration and docking fees from his total savings: $20,000 - $500 - (3 x $500) = $18,500 Next, we need to divide this amount by the cost per foot of the boat: $18,500 \u00f7 $1500/ft = 12.33 ft Since we can't buy a fraction of a foot, we need to round down to the nearest whole number: The longest boat Mitch can buy is 12 feet long. The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: James gets paid $0.50/mile to drive a truck carrying hazardous waste. He has to pay $4.00/gallon for gas and his truck gets 20 miles per gallon. How much profit does he make from a 600 mile trip?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how many gallons of gas James will need for the trip. To do this, we divide the total distance by the truck's gas mileage: 600 miles \u00f7 20 miles per gallon = 30 gallons of gas Next, we need to calculate how much James will spend on gas: 30 gallons x $4.00 per gallon = $120.00 Now we can calculate how much James will earn from the trip: 600 miles x $0.50 per mile = $300.00 Finally, we can calculate James' profit by subtracting the cost of gas from his earnings: $300.00 - $120.00 = $180.00 Therefore, James will make a profit of $180.00 from a 600 mile trip. The answer is 600.\n\n\nQ: A factory decides to stop making cars and start making motorcycles instead. When it made cars, per month, it cost $100 for materials, they could make 4 cars, and they sold each car for $50. Now that they make motorcycles it costs $250 for materials, but they sell 8 of them for $50 each. How much more profit do they make per month selling motorcycles instead of cars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the profit made per car: Revenue per car = $50 Cost per car = $100/4 = $25 Profit per car = Revenue per car - Cost per car = $50 - $25 = $25 Now, let's calculate the profit made per motorcycle: Revenue per motorcycle = $50 x 8 = $400 Cost per motorcycle = $250 Profit per motorcycle = Revenue per motorcycle - Cost per motorcycle = $400 - $250 = $150 Finally, let's calculate the difference in profit between making cars and making motorcycles: Profit difference = Profit per motorcycle - Profit per car = $150 - $25 = $125 Therefore, the factory makes $125 more profit per month by making motorcycles instead of cars. The answer is 125.\n\n\nQ: Maria's monthly salary is $2000. 20% of her salary goes to paying tax, and 5% goes to insurance. Also, a quarter of the money left after the deductions is spent on utility bills. How much money does Maria have after the deductions and utility bills payment?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money goes to tax and insurance. Tax: 20% of $2000 = 0.2 x $2000 = $400 Insurance: 5% of $2000 = 0.05 x $2000 = $100 Next, we need to subtract the total amount of tax and insurance from Maria's monthly salary to find out how much money she has left. $2000 - $400 - $100 = $1500 Now, we need to find out how much money Maria spends on utility bills. A quarter of $1500 = 0.25 x $1500 = $375 Finally, we need to subtract the amount spent on utility bills from the money Maria has left after the deductions. $1500 - $375 = $1125 Therefore, Maria has $1125 left after the deductions and utility bills payment. The answer is 1125.\n\n\n"
