  "test_question": "Q: Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe are trying to catch them all, Pokemon that is.  Together they have caught 339 Pokemon.  Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. How many Pokemon has Stan caught?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Lewis found 4 more items on the scavenger hunt than Samantha.  Samantha found four times the amount of items than Tanya who was only able to find 4 items.  How many items did Lewis find?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many items Samantha found. We know that Samantha found four times the amount of items than Tanya, who found 4 items. So Samantha found 4 x 4 = 16 items. Next, we know that Lewis found 4 more items than Samantha. So we can add 4 to Samantha's total: 16 + 4 = 20. Therefore, Lewis found 20 items on the scavenger hunt. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Jason, Ryan, and Jeffery went fishing at the lake. Ryan caught three times the number of fish that Jason caught. Jefferey caught twice the number of fish that Ryan got.  If Jeffery caught 60 fish, how many fish did all of them catch in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Jeffery caught 60 fish. Next, we know that Jeffery caught twice the number of fish that Ryan caught. So, Ryan must have caught 60/2 = 30 fish. Finally, we know that Ryan caught three times the number of fish that Jason caught. So, Jason must have caught 30/3 = 10 fish. Therefore, the total number of fish caught by all of them is 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 fish. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Joe played catch with Derek and Tammy. He caught the ball 23 times. Derek made four less than double the catches Joe did. Tammy caught the ball sixteen more than a third of the times Derek did. How many times did Tammy catch the ball?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Joe caught the ball 23 times. Next, we need to figure out how many times Derek caught the ball. We know that he made four less than double the catches Joe did. So, we can set up an equation: Derek's catches = 2(Joe's catches) - 4 Derek's catches = 2(23) - 4 Derek's catches = 42 Now we need to figure out how many times Tammy caught the ball. We know that she caught the ball sixteen more than a third of the times Derek did. So, we can set up an equation: Tammy's catches = (1/3)(Derek's catches) + 16 Tammy's catches = (1/3)(42) + 16 Tammy's catches = 14 + 16 Tammy's catches = 30 Therefore, Tammy caught the ball 30 times. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: 1,800 fish swim westward, 3,200 swim eastward, and 500 swim north. What is the number of fish left in the sea, if fishers catch 2/5 of the fish that swam eastward and 3/4 of the fish that swam westward?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many fish were caught by the fishers. 2/5 of 3,200 fish that swam eastward is: (2/5) x 3,200 = 1,280 fish 3/4 of 1,800 fish that swam westward is: (3/4) x 1,800 = 1,350 fish So, the total number of fish caught by the fishers is: 1,280 + 1,350 = 2,630 fish Now, we need to subtract the number of fish caught by the fishers from the total number of fish: 1,800 + 3,200 + 500 - 2,630 = 2,870 fish Therefore, there are 2,870 fish left in the sea. The answer is 2870.\n\n\nQ: Sally, Sam, and Steve went to play with their marbles. In the beginning, Sam has twice as many marbles as Steve while Sally has 5 less than Sam. After Sam has given Sally and Steve 3 marbles each, Sam has 8 marbles left. How many marbles does Steve have now?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Sam had in the beginning. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve, so let's call the number of marbles Steve had \"x\". This means that Sam had 2x marbles. Next, we know that Sally had 5 less marbles than Sam, so Sally had 2x - 5 marbles. After Sam gave 3 marbles each to Sally and Steve, he was left with 8 marbles. This means that he gave away a total of 6 marbles (3 to Sally and 3 to Steve), so he must have started with 14 marbles (8 + 6 = 14). Now we can use this information to figure out how many marbles Steve has. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve in the beginning, so if Sam had 14 marbles, Steve must have had 7 marbles (14 \u00f7 2 = 7). After Sam gave Steve 3 marbles, Steve now has 10 marbles (7 + 3 = 10). The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Ivan has 20 dice. Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. How many dice do they have altogether?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Ivan has 20 dice. Next, we know that Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. So, we can multiply Ivan's number of dice by 2 to find Jerry's number of dice: 20 x 2 = 40 Therefore, Jerry has 40 dice. To find the total number of dice they have altogether, we can add Ivan's and Jerry's number of dice: 20 + 40 = 60 Therefore, they have 60 dice altogether. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Willy has 10 stuffed animals. His mom gives him 2 more stuffed animals for his birthday. After his birthday, if his dad gives him 3 times more stuffed animals than he has, how many stuffed animals does Willy have in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to add the 2 stuffed animals that Willy received from his mom to the 10 he already had: 10 + 2 = 12 Now we know that Willy has 12 stuffed animals. Next, we need to figure out how many stuffed animals Willy's dad gave him. We know that his dad gave him 3 times more stuffed animals than he already had, so we can multiply 12 by 3: 12 x 3 = 36 So Willy's dad gave him 36 stuffed animals. Finally, we can add the 12 stuffed animals Willy already had to the 36 his dad gave him: 12 + 36 = 48 Therefore, Willy has a total of 48 stuffed animals. The answer is 48.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\n"
