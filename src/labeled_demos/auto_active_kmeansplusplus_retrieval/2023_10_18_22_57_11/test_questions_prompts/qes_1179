  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The P.T.O. decided to provide shirts for the elementary students for track and field day. Each grade was given a different color. 101 Kindergartners wore orange shirts that cost $5.80 each. 113 first graders wore yellow shirts that cost $5 each. 107 second graders wore blue shirts that cost $5.60 each. 108 third graders wore green shirts that cost $5.25 each. How much did the P.T.O. spend on shirts for field day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total cost of the orange shirts for the kindergartners: 101 x $5.80 = $585.80 Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the yellow shirts for the first graders: 113 x $5 = $565 Then, we need to calculate the total cost of the blue shirts for the second graders: 107 x $5.60 = $601.20 Finally, we need to calculate the total cost of the green shirts for the third graders: 108 x $5.25 = $567 To find the total cost of all the shirts, we need to add up the costs of each grade: $585.80 + $565 + $601.20 + $567 = $2,319 Therefore, the P.T.O. spent $2,319 on shirts for field day. The answer is 2319.\n\n\nQ: Tickets to the school play cost $6 for students and $8 for adults. If 20 students and 12 adults bought tickets, how many dollars' worth of tickets were sold?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Determine the number of students and adults who bought tickets. Given that 20 students and 12 adults bought tickets. Step 2: Determine the cost of tickets for students and adults. Tickets for students cost $6 and tickets for adults cost $8. Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money made from ticket sales. To calculate the total amount of money made from ticket sales, we need to multiply the number of students by the cost of a student ticket and the number of adults by the cost of an adult ticket, then add the two products together. Total amount of money made = (20 x $6) + (12 x $8) Total amount of money made = $120 + $96 Total amount of money made = $216 Therefore, $216 worth of tickets were sold. The answer is 216.\n\n\nQ: Maddie bought 2 packs of white T-shirts and 4 packs of blue T-shirts for her basketball team. The white T-shirts come in packs of 5, and the blue T-shirts come in packs of 3. Each T-shirt cost $3. How much did Maddie spend in all?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many white T-shirts Maddie bought. She bought 2 packs of white T-shirts, and each pack contains 5 T-shirts. So, she bought a total of 2 x 5 = 10 white T-shirts. Next, we need to find out how many blue T-shirts Maddie bought. She bought 4 packs of blue T-shirts, and each pack contains 3 T-shirts. So, she bought a total of 4 x 3 = 12 blue T-shirts. Now, we can find out how much Maddie spent on white T-shirts. She bought 10 white T-shirts, and each T-shirt cost $3. So, she spent 10 x $3 = $30 on white T-shirts. Similarly, we can find out how much Maddie spent on blue T-shirts. She bought 12 blue T-shirts, and each T-shirt cost $3. So, she spent 12 x $3 = $36 on blue T-shirts. Finally, we can add the amount Maddie spent on white T-shirts and blue T-shirts to find out how much she spent in all. Maddie spent $30 on white T-shirts and $36 on blue T-shirts, so she spent a total of $30 + $36 = $66 in all. The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: Yanna bought ten shirts at $5 each and three pairs of sandals at $3 each.  How much change did she get back if she gave a one hundred dollar bill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of the shirts. 10 shirts x $5 per shirt = $50 Next, let's calculate the total cost of the sandals. 3 pairs of sandals x $3 per pair = $9 Now, let's add the cost of the shirts and sandals together to find the total cost. $50 + $9 = $59 Yanna gave a $100 bill, so we need to subtract the total cost from $100 to find the change. $100 - $59 = $41 Therefore, Yanna received $41 in change. The answer is 41.\n\n\nQ: A teacher has to order supplies for his class to do a science project. Each student needs a bow, a small bottle of vinegar and a box of baking soda. Bows are $5 each, a bottle of vinegar is $2 and a box of baking soda is $1. The teacher has 23 students in this class. How much will the supplies cost?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the bows. Each student needs one bow, and each bow costs $5. So the total cost of bows for 23 students is: $5 x 23 = $115 Next, we need to calculate the cost of the vinegar. Each student needs one small bottle of vinegar, and each bottle costs $2. So the total cost of vinegar for 23 students is: $2 x 23 = $46 Finally, we need to calculate the cost of the baking soda. Each student needs one box of baking soda, and each box costs $1. So the total cost of baking soda for 23 students is: $1 x 23 = $23 To find the total cost of all the supplies, we just need to add up the costs of the bows, vinegar, and baking soda: $115 + $46 + $23 = $184 So the supplies will cost $184 in total. The answer is 184.\n\n\nQ: Twenty people pre-bought plane tickets at a price of $155 per ticket. Thirty people bought their plane tickets at the gate and they each paid $200 for their ticket. How many more dollars did the people at the gate pay for their tickets than those passengers that pre-bought their tickets?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total cost of pre-bought tickets Twenty people pre-bought tickets at $155 per ticket, so the total cost is: 20 x $155 = $3100 Step 2: Find the total cost of tickets bought at the gate Thirty people bought tickets at $200 per ticket, so the total cost is: 30 x $200 = $6000 Step 3: Find the difference in cost between the two groups To find the difference, we subtract the total cost of pre-bought tickets from the total cost of tickets bought at the gate: $6000 - $3100 = $2900 Therefore, the people at the gate paid $2900 more for their tickets than those passengers that pre-bought their tickets. The answer is 2900.\n\n\nQ: Whitney\u2019s mom gave her two $20 bills to spend at the school book fair. Whitney has decided to buy 2 posters, 3 notebooks, and 2 bookmarks. Each poster costs $5, each notebook costs $4, and each bookmark costs $2. How much money, in dollars, will Whitney have left over after the purchase?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of the posters. Whitney is buying 2 posters, and each poster costs $5, so the total cost of the posters is 2 x $5 = $10. Next, let's calculate the total cost of the notebooks. Whitney is buying 3 notebooks, and each notebook costs $4, so the total cost of the notebooks is 3 x $4 = $12. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the bookmarks. Whitney is buying 2 bookmarks, and each bookmark costs $2, so the total cost of the bookmarks is 2 x $2 = $4. Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Whitney is buying: $10 + $12 + $4 = $26. Whitney started with two $20 bills, which is a total of $40. After spending $26 on the posters, notebooks, and bookmarks, she will have $40 - $26 = $14 left over. Therefore, Whitney will have $14 left over after the purchase. The answer is 14.\n\n\nQ: A math teacher had $100 to buy three different types of calculators. A basic calculator costs $8. A scientific calculator costs twice the price as the basic while a graphing calculator costs thrice the price as the scientific. How much change did she receive after buying those three different types of calculators?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many calculators of each type the teacher can buy with $100. Let's start with the basic calculator. Each basic calculator costs $8, so the teacher can buy 100/8 = 12.5 basic calculators. Since we can't buy half a calculator, we'll round down to 12 basic calculators. Next, let's figure out how many scientific calculators the teacher can buy. Each scientific calculator costs twice as much as a basic calculator, so it costs $8 x 2 = $16. With $100, the teacher can buy 100/16 = 6.25 scientific calculators. Again, we'll round down to 6 scientific calculators. Finally, let's figure out how many graphing calculators the teacher can buy. Each graphing calculator costs three times as much as a scientific calculator, so it costs $16 x 3 = $48. With $100, the teacher can buy 100/48 = 2.08 graphing calculators. We'll round down to 2 graphing calculators. So in total, the teacher can buy 12 basic calculators, 6 scientific calculators, and 2 graphing calculators. The cost of the basic calculators is 12 x $8 = $96. The cost of the scientific calculators is 6 x $16 = $96. The cost of the graphing calculators is 2 x $48 = $96. So the total cost of all the calculators is $96 + $96 + $96 = $288. The teacher started with $100, so she received $100 - $288 = -$188 in change. However, since she didn't have enough money to buy all the calculators she wanted, she actually owes $188. The answer is 188.\n\n\n"
