  "formatted_prompt": "Q: For homework, Juan's teacher asked everyone in the class, to write down the different types of transportation (cars, trucks, bicycles, skateboards etc) they saw on their way home that afternoon.  After school, Juan walked home and saw the following: 15 cars, 3 bicycles, 8 pickup trucks and 1 tricycle.  How many tires in total were there on the vehicles Juan saw?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine the number of tires on each type of vehicle. - Cars have 4 tires each, so 15 cars would have 15 x 4 = 60 tires. - Bicycles have 2 tires each, so 3 bicycles would have 3 x 2 = 6 tires. - Pickup trucks have 4 tires each, so 8 pickup trucks would have 8 x 4 = 32 tires. - A tricycle has 3 tires. To find the total number of tires, we add up the number of tires for each type of vehicle: 60 + 6 + 32 + 3 = 101 Therefore, Juan saw a total of 101 tires on the vehicles he saw on his way home. The answer is 101.\n\n\nQ: Ignatius owns 4 bicycles.  A friend of his owns different types of cycles, which have three times are many tires as Ignatius's bikes have. He has one unicycle, a tricycle, and the rest are bikes. How many bicycles does the friend own?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many tires Ignatius's bikes have. Since each bike has two tires, Ignatius's bikes have a total of 4 x 2 = 8 tires. Next, we need to find out how many tires the friend's cycles have. We know that the friend's cycles have three times as many tires as Ignatius's bikes, so the friend's cycles have a total of 8 x 3 = 24 tires. We also know that the friend has one unicycle and one tricycle, which have a total of 1 + 3 = 4 tires. Therefore, the friend's bicycles must have a total of 24 - 4 = 20 tires. Since each bike has two tires, the friend must have a total of 20 / 2 = 10 bicycles. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Yanna bought ten shirts at $5 each and three pairs of sandals at $3 each.  How much change did she get back if she gave a one hundred dollar bill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of the shirts. 10 shirts x $5 per shirt = $50 Next, let's calculate the total cost of the sandals. 3 pairs of sandals x $3 per pair = $9 Now, let's add the cost of the shirts and sandals together to find the total cost. $50 + $9 = $59 Yanna gave a $100 bill, so we need to subtract the total cost from $100 to find the change. $100 - $59 = $41 Therefore, Yanna received $41 in change. The answer is 41.\n\n\nQ: Tara's taking a road trip for the weekend.  She drives for two days, stopping to fill up her gas tank each time from empty to full when she needs it.  She visits 4 different gas stations in total, with the price of gas being $3, $3.50, $4, and $4.50 respectively at each.  If Tara's car has a 12-gallon tank, how much does she spend on gas for her road trip?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how much gas Tara needs to fill up her 12-gallon tank each time. To do this, we can simply multiply 12 by 1, since she is filling up from empty to full each time. So, Tara needs 12 gallons of gas at each of the 4 gas stations she visits. Next, we need to calculate how much she spends at each gas station. At the first gas station, where gas is $3 per gallon, Tara spends 12 x 3 = $36. At the second gas station, where gas is $3.50 per gallon, Tara spends 12 x 3.5 = $42. At the third gas station, where gas is $4 per gallon, Tara spends 12 x 4 = $48. And finally, at the fourth gas station, where gas is $4.50 per gallon, Tara spends 12 x 4.5 = $54. To find the total amount Tara spends on gas for her road trip, we simply add up the amounts she spent at each gas station: $36 + $42 + $48 + $54 = $180 Therefore, Tara spends $180 on gas for her road trip. The answer is 180.\n\n\nQ: A factory decides to stop making cars and start making motorcycles instead. When it made cars, per month, it cost $100 for materials, they could make 4 cars, and they sold each car for $50. Now that they make motorcycles it costs $250 for materials, but they sell 8 of them for $50 each. How much more profit do they make per month selling motorcycles instead of cars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the profit made per car: Revenue per car = $50 Cost per car = $100/4 = $25 Profit per car = Revenue per car - Cost per car = $50 - $25 = $25 Now, let's calculate the profit made per motorcycle: Revenue per motorcycle = $50 x 8 = $400 Cost per motorcycle = $250 Profit per motorcycle = Revenue per motorcycle - Cost per motorcycle = $400 - $250 = $150 Finally, let's calculate the difference in profit between making cars and making motorcycles: Profit difference = Profit per motorcycle - Profit per car = $150 - $25 = $125 Therefore, the factory makes $125 more profit per month by making motorcycles instead of cars. The answer is 125.\n\n\nQ: Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how much money Carl will earn in four weeks. If he earns $0.50 every time, and he buys a candy bar each time, that means he's spending $0.50 each week. But he's also earning $0.75 each week for taking out his neighbor's trash. So his net earnings each week are $0.75 - $0.50 = $0.25. Over four weeks, that's a total of $0.25 x 4 = $1. So Carl will have $1 to spend on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.50, he can buy 2 candy bars with his earnings. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Whitney\u2019s mom gave her two $20 bills to spend at the school book fair. Whitney has decided to buy 2 posters, 3 notebooks, and 2 bookmarks. Each poster costs $5, each notebook costs $4, and each bookmark costs $2. How much money, in dollars, will Whitney have left over after the purchase?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of the posters. Whitney is buying 2 posters, and each poster costs $5, so the total cost of the posters is 2 x $5 = $10. Next, let's calculate the total cost of the notebooks. Whitney is buying 3 notebooks, and each notebook costs $4, so the total cost of the notebooks is 3 x $4 = $12. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the bookmarks. Whitney is buying 2 bookmarks, and each bookmark costs $2, so the total cost of the bookmarks is 2 x $2 = $4. Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Whitney is buying: $10 + $12 + $4 = $26. Whitney started with two $20 bills, which is a total of $40. After spending $26 on the posters, notebooks, and bookmarks, she will have $40 - $26 = $14 left over. Therefore, Whitney will have $14 left over after the purchase. The answer is 14.\n\n\nQ: Frank's laundry detergent is double concentrated and will wash 80 loads of laundry.  His detergent is usually $25.00 a bottle but they're having a sale.  If he buys 2 bottles, both bottles will drop to $20.00 a bottle.  How much does he spend, in cents, per load of laundry, if he buys 2 bottles of detergent?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the cost of one bottle of detergent during the sale: $25.00 - $20.00 = $5.00 discount per bottle $25.00 - $5.00 = $20.00 per bottle during the sale Since Frank buys 2 bottles during the sale, he spends: 2 bottles x $20.00 per bottle = $40.00 Now, let's calculate the cost per load of laundry: $40.00 for 2 bottles x 80 loads per bottle = 160 loads $40.00 for 160 loads = $0.25 per load Therefore, Frank spends 25 cents per load of laundry if he buys 2 bottles of detergent during the sale. The answer is 2.\n\n\n"
