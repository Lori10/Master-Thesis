  "test_question": "Q: Lori wants to buy a $320.00 pair of shoes and a matching belt that is $32.00.  Her part-time job pays her $8.00 an hour.  How many hours will she have to work before she can make her purchase?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Marcus wants to buy a new pair of shoes. He decided to pay not more than $130 for them. He found a pair for $120, on which he got a discount of 30%. How much money will he manage to save by buying these shoes and not spending the assumed maximum amount?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the discount Marcus got on the shoes. Discount = 30% of $120 = 0.3 x $120 = $36 This means Marcus paid $120 - $36 = $84 for the shoes. Now we can calculate how much money he saved by buying these shoes instead of spending the maximum amount of $130. Savings = $130 - $84 = $46 Therefore, Marcus managed to save $46 by buying these shoes and not spending the assumed maximum amount. The answer is 46.\n\n\nQ: A department store offers a 10% discount for the amount exceeding $100 of the customer's total charge. Jaco bought a pair of shoes for $74; 2 pairs of socks that cost $2 per pair; a bag that costs $42. How much will Jaco pay for those items?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jaco bought: - Shoes: $74 - Socks: 2 pairs x $2 per pair = $4 - Bag: $42 Total cost = $74 + $4 + $42 = $120 Since the total cost exceeds $100, Jaco is eligible for a discount. The amount that exceeds $100 is $20 ($120 - $100). The discount is 10% of $20, which is $2. Therefore, Jaco will pay the total cost minus the discount: Total cost - discount = $120 - $2 = $118 Jaco will pay $118 for those items. The answer is 118.\n\n\nQ: Doris earns $20 per hour by babysitting. She needs to earn at least $1200 for her monthly expenses. She can babysit for 3 hours every weekday and 5 hours on a Saturday.  How many weeks does it take for Doris to earn enough to cover her monthly expenses?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much Doris earns per week by babysitting. She babysits for 3 hours every weekday, which is a total of 15 hours per week (3 hours x 5 days). She also babysits for 5 hours on a Saturday, which adds another 5 hours to her weekly total. So, in total, she babysits for 20 hours per week. If she earns $20 per hour, then she earns 20 x 20 = $400 per week. To cover her monthly expenses of $1200, she needs to earn 1200 / 400 = 3 weeks of babysitting. Therefore, it takes Doris 3 weeks to earn enough to cover her monthly expenses. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Marco has $24. Mary has $15. If Marco gives Mary half of what he has, Mary will have more than Marco. But Mary spends $5. How much more money does Mary have than Marco?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much money Marco gives to Mary. Since Marco has $24, half of that would be $12. So, Marco gives $12 to Mary. After receiving $12 from Marco, Mary will have $15 + $12 = $27. However, Mary spends $5, so we need to subtract that from her total. $27 - $5 = $22. Therefore, Mary has $22 more than Marco. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Yanna bought ten shirts at $5 each and three pairs of sandals at $3 each.  How much change did she get back if she gave a one hundred dollar bill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of the shirts. 10 shirts x $5 per shirt = $50 Next, let's calculate the total cost of the sandals. 3 pairs of sandals x $3 per pair = $9 Now, let's add the cost of the shirts and sandals together to find the total cost. $50 + $9 = $59 Yanna gave a $100 bill, so we need to subtract the total cost from $100 to find the change. $100 - $59 = $41 Therefore, Yanna received $41 in change. The answer is 41.\n\n\nQ: Jerry works as an independent contractor for a company that pays him $40 per task. If each task takes him two hours to complete and he works 10 hours a day for a whole week, calculate the total amount of money he would earn at the end of the week.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many tasks Jerry can complete in a day. Since each task takes him two hours to complete, he can complete 10/2 = 5 tasks in a day. Next, we need to find out how many tasks Jerry can complete in a week. Since he works 10 hours a day for a whole week, he works a total of 10*7 = 70 hours in a week. Therefore, he can complete 70/2 = 35 tasks in a week. Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money Jerry would earn at the end of the week. Since he earns $40 per task, he would earn a total of 40*35 = $1400 at the end of the week. The answer is 1400.\n\n\nQ: Maria's birthday is in 22 days. Her friend Lilly wants to buy her flowers so she saves $2 each day until Maria's birthday. If a flower costs $4, how many flowers can she buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Lilly will have saved up by Maria's birthday. Lilly saves $2 each day for 22 days, so she will have saved: $2/day x 22 days = $44 Now we need to figure out how many flowers Lilly can buy with $44. Each flower costs $4, so we can divide the total amount of money Lilly has saved by the cost of each flower: $44 \u00f7 $4/flower = 11 flowers Therefore, Lilly can buy 11 flowers for Maria's birthday. The answer is 11.\n\n\nQ: Mrs. Thomson received an incentive worth $240. She spent 1/3 of the money on food and 1/5 of it on clothes. Then, she put in her savings account 3/4 of the remaining money. How much money did Mrs. Thomson save?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Mrs. Thomson spent on food. We know that she spent 1/3 of the $240 incentive on food, so we can calculate: 1/3 x $240 = $80 Next, we need to find out how much money she spent on clothes. We know that she spent 1/5 of the $240 incentive on clothes, so we can calculate: 1/5 x $240 = $48 To find out how much money she had left after spending on food and clothes, we need to subtract the amounts she spent from the total incentive: $240 - $80 - $48 = $112 Now we know that Mrs. Thomson had $112 left. She put 3/4 of this amount into her savings account, so we can calculate: 3/4 x $112 = $84 Therefore, Mrs. Thomson saved $84. The answer is 84.\n\n\n"
