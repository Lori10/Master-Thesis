  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A mountain range has 200 active volcanoes. In a particular year, 20% of the volcanoes exploded in the first two months, 40% of the remaining exploded by the half of the year, and at the end of the year, another 50% of the volcanoes that hadn't already erupted also exploded. How many mountains are still intact at the end of the year?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many volcanoes exploded in the first two months. 20% of 200 = 40 volcanoes exploded in the first two months. Next, we need to find out how many volcanoes were left after the first two months. 200 - 40 = 160 volcanoes were left. Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining volcanoes exploded by the half of the year. 40% of 160 = 64 volcanoes exploded by the half of the year. So, we have 160 - 64 = 96 volcanoes left. Finally, we need to find out how many of the remaining volcanoes exploded at the end of the year. 50% of 96 = 48 volcanoes exploded at the end of the year. Therefore, the number of mountains still intact at the end of the year is: 96 - 48 = 48 mountains. The answer is 48.\n\n\nQ: John is working as an IT specialist. He repairs broken computers. One day he had to fix 20 computers. 20% of them were unfixable, and 40% of them needed to wait a few days for spare parts to come. The rest John was able to fix right away. How many computers John was able to fix right away?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many computers were unfixable. We know that 20% of 20 computers were unfixable, so we can calculate: 20% of 20 = 0.2 x 20 = 4 So, John couldn't fix 4 computers. Next, we need to find out how many computers needed to wait for spare parts. We know that 40% of 20 computers needed to wait, so we can calculate: 40% of 20 = 0.4 x 20 = 8 So, 8 computers needed to wait for spare parts. Now, we can subtract the unfixable and waiting computers from the total to find out how many John was able to fix right away: 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 Therefore, John was able to fix 8 computers right away. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Six more than twice as many ducks go to North Pond as go to Lake Michigan. If Lake Michigan has 100 ducks, how many ducks can you safely estimate there will be at North Pond?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many ducks go to North Pond. We know that \"Six more than twice as many ducks go to North Pond as go to Lake Michigan.\" So, we can start by finding twice as many ducks as Lake Michigan: 2 x 100 = 200 Now, we add six to that: 200 + 6 = 206 Therefore, we can safely estimate that there will be 206 ducks at North Pond. The answer is 206.\n\n\nQ: Cornelia likes to travel. She visited already 42 different countries. 20 of them were in Europe and 10 in South America. From the rest of the countries, only half of them were in Asia. How many Asian countries has Cornelia visited?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Cornelia visited a total of 42 countries. Out of those 42 countries, 20 were in Europe and 10 were in South America. So, the number of countries Cornelia visited outside of Europe and South America is: 42 - 20 - 10 = 12 Now we know that half of the remaining countries were in Asia. So, the number of Asian countries Cornelia visited is: 12 / 2 = 6 Therefore, Cornelia visited 6 Asian countries. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Luke started working on a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle. The first day he worked on it, he put together 10% of the pieces. On the second day, he put together another 20% of the remaining pieces from the first day. On the third day, he put together 30% of the remaining pieces from the previous day. How many pieces does he have left to complete after the third day?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Luke put together 10% of the 1000 pieces, which is 100 pieces. So he has 900 pieces left. On the second day, he put together 20% of the remaining 900 pieces, which is 180 pieces. So he has 720 pieces left. On the third day, he put together 30% of the remaining 720 pieces, which is 216 pieces. So he has 504 pieces left. Therefore, after the third day, Luke has 504 pieces left to complete the puzzle. The answer is 504.\n\n\nQ: If one fourth of the engines are defective, and there are 5 batches of 80 engines each. How many engines are not defective?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many engines are in total. We can do this by multiplying the number of batches by the number of engines in each batch: 5 batches x 80 engines/batch = 400 engines Next, we need to figure out how many of these engines are defective. We know that one fourth of the engines are defective, so we can find this by dividing the total number of engines by 4: 400 engines / 4 = 100 defective engines Finally, we can subtract the number of defective engines from the total number of engines to find out how many are not defective: 400 engines - 100 defective engines = 300 engines Therefore, there are 300 engines that are not defective. The answer is 300.\n\n\nQ: A library has a number of books. 35% of them are intended for children and 104 of them are for adults. How many books are in the library?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 35% of the books are intended for children. This means that 65% of the books are intended for adults. We also know that there are 104 books intended for adults. To find the total number of books in the library, we can set up a proportion: 65/100 = 104/x We can cross-multiply to solve for x: 65x = 10400 x = 160 Therefore, there are 160 books in the library. The answer is 160.\n\n\nQ: A group of 30 tourists sets out on a walking tour of the rainforest. Two tourists are eaten by anacondas, then half the remaining tourists try to pet poisonous dart frogs and get poisoned. If only 1/7 of the poisoned tourists recovered, how many tourists are left at the end of the tour?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Start with 30 tourists. Step 2: Two tourists are eaten by anacondas, so we subtract 2 from 30 to get 28 tourists remaining. Step 3: Half of the remaining tourists try to pet poisonous dart frogs and get poisoned. Half of 28 is 14, so we subtract 14 from 28 to get 14 tourists remaining. Step 4: Only 1/7 of the poisoned tourists recovered. 1/7 of 14 is 2, so we add 2 to the 14 tourists remaining to get 16 tourists at the end of the tour. Therefore, there are 16 tourists left at the end of the tour. The answer is 16.\n\n\n"
