  "test_question": "Q: Becky, Jake, and Silvia shared 4 pizzas. Each pizza had 8 slices. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did. Silvia ate twice as many slices than Jake did. If Becky ate 10 slices, how many total slices did they eat?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Phoebe has two pizzas to share with her and three friends. One has pepperoni and the other has cheese. They both have 16 slices. They all eat the same amount. One friend eats only pepperoni, while the rest have an equal number of slices of each. At the end, there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese, how many slices does each person eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 2 pizzas with 16 slices each, so there are a total of 32 slices. Next, we know that one friend only eats pepperoni, so they eat one slice from the pepperoni pizza. That leaves 31 slices, with 15 slices from each pizza. We also know that there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese left. So, the remaining 15 slices are divided equally among the remaining 3 friends, which means each of them eats 5 slices. Therefore, each person eats 1 slice of pepperoni and 5 slices of cheese. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Phill cuts the pizza in half, which gives him 2 slices. Then he cuts both halves in half, which gives him 4 slices. And then he cuts each slice in half again, which gives him 8 slices in total. Next, Phill passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends, which means he gives away 3 slices in total. He also passes out 2 slices to 2 of his friends, which means he gives away 4 slices in total. Therefore, Phill has given away a total of 7 slices of pizza. If he started with 8 slices, then he has 1 slice left for himself. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: A pie shop charges $5 for a slice of pie. They cut each whole pie into 4 slices. How much money will the pie shop make if they sell 9 pies?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of pie are in 9 whole pies. Since each pie is cut into 4 slices, we can multiply 9 by 4 to get the total number of slices: 9 x 4 = 36 So there are 36 slices of pie in 9 whole pies. Next, we need to find out how much money the pie shop will make if they sell all 36 slices. Each slice costs $5, so we can multiply 36 by 5 to get the total amount of money: 36 x 5 = 180 Therefore, the pie shop will make $180 if they sell 9 whole pies, each cut into 4 slices, at $5 per slice. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: GiGi took out a big bowl of mushrooms from the refrigerator.  She cut each mushroom into 4 pieces.  Her twins, Kenny and Karla sprinkled mushrooms on their pizzas and baked them in the oven.  Kenny grabbed a handful and sprinkled 38 mushroom pieces on his pizza.  Karla scooped them up with both hands and sprinkled 42 mushroom pieces on her pizza.  On the cutting board, were 8 pieces of mushrooms remaining.  How many mushrooms did GiGi cut up at the beginning?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that GiGi cut up a certain number of mushrooms into 4 pieces each. Let's call the total number of mushrooms she cut up \"x\". Next, we know that Kenny sprinkled 38 mushroom pieces on his pizza. Since each mushroom was cut into 4 pieces, this means he used 38/4 = 9.5 mushrooms. However, since he can't use half a mushroom, we know he used 9 mushrooms. Similarly, Karla used 42/4 = 10.5 mushrooms, but since she can't use half a mushroom, we know she used 10 mushrooms. So far, we know that Kenny and Karla used a total of 9+10 = 19 mushrooms. Finally, we know that there were 8 pieces of mushrooms left on the cutting board. Since each mushroom was cut into 4 pieces, this means there were 8/4 = 2 mushrooms left. To find the total number of mushrooms GiGi cut up at the beginning, we can add up the number of mushrooms used by Kenny and Karla, plus the number of mushrooms left on the cutting board: x = 19 + 2 = 21 Therefore, GiGi cut up 21 mushrooms at the beginning. The answer is 21.\n\n\nQ: Shane prepares sandwiches for the Boy Scouts. He buys 2 packages of sliced bread containing 20 slices each, and he also buys 2 packages of sliced ham containing 8 slices each. Shane will make as many sandwiches as he can according to the ham he has. How many slices of bread will he have leftover?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of ham Shane has in total. 2 packages of sliced ham containing 8 slices each = 2 x 8 = 16 slices of ham Now, we know that Shane will make as many sandwiches as he can according to the ham he has. Since each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread, we can calculate the maximum number of sandwiches he can make: 16 slices of ham / 2 slices of bread per sandwich = 8 sandwiches So, Shane will make 8 sandwiches. Each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread, so he will use: 8 sandwiches x 2 slices of bread per sandwich = 16 slices of bread Shane has 2 packages of sliced bread containing 20 slices each, so he has: 2 packages x 20 slices per package = 40 slices of bread Therefore, he will have: 40 slices of bread - 16 slices of bread used = 24 slices of bread leftover. So, Shane will have 24 slices of bread leftover. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Cassandra bought four dozen Granny Smith apples and used them to make four apple pies.  She cut each pie into 6 large pieces.  How many apples are in each slice of pie?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Determine the total number of apples Cassandra bought. - One dozen is equal to 12, so four dozen is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 apples. Step 2: Determine the total number of pieces of pie Cassandra made. - Each pie was cut into 6 pieces, so four pies would be cut into 4 x 6 = 24 pieces. Step 3: Determine the number of apples in each slice of pie. - To do this, we need to divide the total number of apples by the total number of pieces of pie. - 48 apples / 24 pieces = 2 apples per slice of pie. Therefore, there are 2 apples in each slice of pie. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: There are four members in one household. Each member consumes 3 slices of bread during breakfast and 2 slices of bread for snacks. A loaf of bread has 12 slices. How many days will five loaves of bread last in this family?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of bread each member consumes per day. For breakfast, each member consumes 3 slices of bread. For snacks, each member consumes 2 slices of bread. So, in total, each member consumes 3 + 2 = 5 slices of bread per day. Since there are four members in the household, the total number of slices of bread consumed per day is 4 x 5 = 20 slices. Now, we need to find out how many days five loaves of bread will last. One loaf of bread has 12 slices, so five loaves of bread have 5 x 12 = 60 slices. If the family consumes 20 slices of bread per day, then 60 slices will last for 60/20 = 3 days. Therefore, five loaves of bread will last for 3 days in this family. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: At Penny\u2019s bakery, her famous blueberry cheesecakes are $7 a slice.  Each cheesecake pie is cut into 6 thick slices.  If she sells 7 cheesecake pies, how much money does she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of cheesecake Penny has in total. Since each cheesecake pie is cut into 6 slices, we can multiply 6 by the number of cheesecake pies she sold: 6 slices/pie x 7 pies = 42 slices So Penny sold 42 slices of blueberry cheesecake. Next, we need to find out how much money she made from selling those 42 slices. Each slice costs $7, so we can multiply 7 by the number of slices: $7/slice x 42 slices = $294 Therefore, Penny made $294 from selling 7 cheesecake pies. The answer is 7.\n\n\n"
