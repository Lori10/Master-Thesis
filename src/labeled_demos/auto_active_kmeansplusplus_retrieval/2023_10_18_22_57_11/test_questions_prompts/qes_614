  "test_question": "Q: Jennifer bought 12 oranges from the market, she gave her three daughters 2 oranges each, and her only boy got 3 oranges. How many oranges did she remain with?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A total of 107 oranges are picked by Del and Juan. Del picked 23 on each of 2 days and Juan picked the rest. How many oranges did Juan pick?\nA: Let's think step by step. Del picked 23 oranges on each of 2 days, so he picked a total of 23 x 2 = 46 oranges. If the total number of oranges picked by both Del and Juan is 107, then Juan picked 107 - 46 = 61 oranges. Therefore, Juan picked 61 oranges. The answer is 61.\n\n\nQ: Cristine bought a dozen lemons and gave 1/4 of them to her neighbor. How many lemons does Cristine have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine how many lemons are in a dozen. A dozen is equal to 12, so Cristine bought 12 lemons. Next, we need to figure out how many lemons Cristine gave to her neighbor. She gave away 1/4 of the lemons, which means she gave away 1/4 x 12 = 3 lemons. To find out how many lemons Cristine has left, we need to subtract the number of lemons she gave away from the total number of lemons she bought. 12 - 3 = 9 Therefore, Cristine has 9 lemons left. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: There are 10 bags with 30 oranges each on a truck. A total of 50 pieces of oranges are rotten. Thirty pieces of oranges will be kept for making orange juice and the rest will be sold. How many pieces of oranges will be sold?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of oranges in the 10 bags. 10 bags x 30 oranges/bag = 300 oranges Next, we need to subtract the number of rotten oranges. 300 oranges - 50 rotten oranges = 250 good oranges Now, we know that 30 oranges will be kept for making juice. 250 good oranges - 30 oranges for juice = 220 oranges to be sold Therefore, 220 pieces of oranges will be sold. The answer is 220.\n\n\nQ: Last night Kannon had 3 apples, a banana, and 4 oranges for dinner. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, and twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today. How many fruits would she have eaten so far in the two meals?\nA: Let's think step by step. Last night Kannon had 3 apples, 1 banana, and 4 oranges, so she had a total of 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 fruits. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, which means she will have 3 + 4 = 7 apples today. She is also planning to have 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, which means she will have 1 x 10 = 10 bananas today. Finally, she is planning to have twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today, which means she will have 7 x 2 = 14 oranges today. Therefore, in total, Kannon will have eaten 7 + 10 + 14 = 31 fruits in the two meals. The answer is 31.\n\n\nQ: Vicente saw Sophie's mom giving Sophie 20 oranges every day to carry to school to eat. He also saw Hannah's dad giving Hannah 40 grapes every day to eat at the school. If he counted the number of fruits that the girls were given for 30 days, calculate the total number of fruits that Sophie and Hannah had eaten in the 30 days.\nA: Let's think step by step. Sophie was given 20 oranges every day for 30 days, so the total number of oranges she received is: 20 oranges/day x 30 days = 600 oranges Similarly, Hannah was given 40 grapes every day for 30 days, so the total number of grapes she received is: 40 grapes/day x 30 days = 1200 grapes Therefore, the total number of fruits that Sophie and Hannah had eaten in the 30 days is: 600 oranges + 1200 grapes = 1800 fruits The answer is 1800.\n\n\nQ: Tania has five baskets containing a total of 58 fruits. There are 18 mangoes in one basket, 10 pears in another, 12 pawpaws in another and the last 2 contain the same number of kiwi and lemon respectively, how many lemons are there?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of fruits in the three baskets that are not kiwi or lemon. 18 + 10 + 12 = 40 So, there are 40 fruits in those three baskets. Next, we need to find the total number of fruits in all five baskets. If there are 58 fruits in total, and 40 of them are in the three baskets we just added up, then the remaining two baskets must contain: 58 - 40 = 18 fruits We know that one of those baskets contains kiwi and the other contains lemon, and they have the same number of fruits. So, we can divide the remaining 18 fruits by 2 to get: 18 / 2 = 9 Therefore, there are 9 lemons in the basket with lemon. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: James takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces.  He splits the pieces between 4 people.  If an orange has 80 calories how many calories does each person get?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pieces James has in total. He takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces, so he has 5 x 8 = 40 pieces in total. Next, we need to divide the pieces between 4 people. To do this, we can divide the total number of pieces by 4: 40 \u00f7 4 = 10 pieces per person. Finally, we need to find out how many calories each person gets. We know that one orange has 80 calories, so each piece has 80 \u00f7 8 = 10 calories. Therefore, each person gets 10 x 10 = 100 calories. So each person gets 100 calories. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Ella has 4 bags with 20 apples in each bag and six bags with 25 apples in each bag. If Ella sells 200 apples, how many apples does Ella has left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many apples Ella has in total. She has 4 bags with 20 apples in each bag, so that's 4 x 20 = 80 apples. She also has 6 bags with 25 apples in each bag, so that's 6 x 25 = 150 apples. In total, Ella has 80 + 150 = 230 apples. If she sells 200 apples, we can subtract that from the total: 230 - 200 = 30 Therefore, Ella has 30 apples left. The answer is 30.\n\n\n"
