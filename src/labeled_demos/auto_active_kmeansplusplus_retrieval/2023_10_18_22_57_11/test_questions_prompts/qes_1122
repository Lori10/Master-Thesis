  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Sarah wants to start a cupcake business and was approved for a business loan.  The loan has 0% interest if she pays the entire amount back in 5 years, which she decides to do.  If she put $10,000 down as a down payment and her monthly payments are $600.00, how much was her loan for (including the down payment)?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total number of months in 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 5 years would be 5 x 12 = 60 months. Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money Sarah will pay in monthly payments. She will pay $600 per month for 60 months, so the total amount of money she will pay is 600 x 60 = $36,000. Now, we can calculate the total cost of the loan, including the down payment. Sarah put $10,000 down, and she will pay $36,000 in monthly payments, so the total cost of the loan is $10,000 + $36,000 = $46,000. Therefore, Sarah's loan was for $46,000 (including the down payment). The answer is 46000.\n\n\nQ: John adopts a dog from a shelter.  The dog ends up having health problems and this requires 3 vet appointments,  which cost $400 each.  After the first appointment, John paid $100 for pet insurance that covers 80% of the subsequent visits.  How much did he pay in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, John paid $400 for the first vet appointment. Then, he paid $100 for pet insurance that covers 80% of the subsequent visits. This means that for the next two vet appointments, he will only have to pay 20% of the cost. So for the second and third vet appointments, John will pay: 20% of $400 = $80 Therefore, the total cost for the three vet appointments will be: $400 (first appointment) + $80 (second appointment) + $80 (third appointment) = $560 So John paid a total of $560 for the three vet appointments. The answer is 560.\n\n\nQ: Mr. Sean has a veterinary clinic where he charges clients $60 to treat a dog and $40 to care for a cat. If Khalil took 20 dogs and 60 cats to the clinic for treatment, how much money did he pay Mr. Sean?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of treating 20 dogs. 20 dogs x $60/dog = $1200 Next, we need to calculate the cost of caring for 60 cats. 60 cats x $40/cat = $2400 Finally, we add the cost of treating the dogs and caring for the cats to find the total cost. $1200 + $2400 = $3600 Therefore, Khalil paid Mr. Sean $3600 for treating 20 dogs and 60 cats. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Grant spends $200.00 a year to have the newspaper delivered daily to his house.  Juanita buys the newspaper daily.  Monday through Saturday, she spends $0.50 and on Sunday she spends $2.00.  How much more money does Juanita spend buying the newspaper yearly than Grant?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper daily from Monday to Saturday: $0.50 x 6 = $3.00 Now, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper on Sundays: $2.00 x 1 = $2.00 Next, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper weekly: $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00 Finally, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper yearly: $5.00 x 52 = $260.00 Now, let's calculate the difference between what Juanita spends and what Grant spends: $260.00 - $200.00 = $60.00 Therefore, Juanita spends $60.00 more buying the newspaper yearly than Grant. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: A factory decides to stop making cars and start making motorcycles instead. When it made cars, per month, it cost $100 for materials, they could make 4 cars, and they sold each car for $50. Now that they make motorcycles it costs $250 for materials, but they sell 8 of them for $50 each. How much more profit do they make per month selling motorcycles instead of cars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the profit made per car: Revenue per car = $50 Cost per car = $100/4 = $25 Profit per car = Revenue per car - Cost per car = $50 - $25 = $25 Now, let's calculate the profit made per motorcycle: Revenue per motorcycle = $50 x 8 = $400 Cost per motorcycle = $250 Profit per motorcycle = Revenue per motorcycle - Cost per motorcycle = $400 - $250 = $150 Finally, let's calculate the difference in profit between making cars and making motorcycles: Profit difference = Profit per motorcycle - Profit per car = $150 - $25 = $125 Therefore, the factory makes $125 more profit per month by making motorcycles instead of cars. The answer is 125.\n\n\nQ: A laboratory needs flasks, test tubes, and safety gear to carry out its experiments. They were given a $325 budget for the month. They bought $150 worth of flasks, spent two-thirds of that amount on test tubes, and used half of the test tube cost on safety gear. How many dollars of their budget remained?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that they spent $150 on flasks. Next, we need to find out how much they spent on test tubes. We know they spent two-thirds of the flask cost on test tubes, so: $150 x 2/3 = $100 So they spent $100 on test tubes. Finally, we need to find out how much they spent on safety gear. We know they spent half of the test tube cost on safety gear, so: $100 / 2 = $50 So they spent $50 on safety gear. To find out how much of their budget remained, we need to subtract the total amount spent from the initial budget: $325 - $150 - $100 - $50 = $25 Therefore, they have $25 of their budget remaining. The answer is 25.\n\n\nQ: Jerry works as an independent contractor for a company that pays him $40 per task. If each task takes him two hours to complete and he works 10 hours a day for a whole week, calculate the total amount of money he would earn at the end of the week.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many tasks Jerry can complete in a day. Since each task takes him two hours to complete, he can complete 10/2 = 5 tasks in a day. Next, we need to find out how many tasks Jerry can complete in a week. Since he works 10 hours a day for a whole week, he works a total of 10*7 = 70 hours in a week. Therefore, he can complete 70/2 = 35 tasks in a week. Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money Jerry would earn at the end of the week. Since he earns $40 per task, he would earn a total of 40*35 = $1400 at the end of the week. The answer is 1400.\n\n\nQ: Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how much money Carl will earn in four weeks. If he earns $0.50 every time, and he buys a candy bar each time, that means he's spending $0.50 each week. But he's also earning $0.75 each week for taking out his neighbor's trash. So his net earnings each week are $0.75 - $0.50 = $0.25. Over four weeks, that's a total of $0.25 x 4 = $1. So Carl will have $1 to spend on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.50, he can buy 2 candy bars with his earnings. The answer is 2.\n\n\n"
