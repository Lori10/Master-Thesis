  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Eric has 20 marbles. He has 12 white marbles, 6 blue marbles, and the rest are green marbles. How many green marbles does Eric have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Eric has a total of 20 marbles. Out of those 20 marbles, he has 12 white marbles and 6 blue marbles. To find out how many green marbles he has, we need to subtract the number of white and blue marbles from the total number of marbles: 20 - 12 - 6 = 2 Therefore, Eric has 2 green marbles. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Andy is mixing blue, green and white paint in a 1 : 2 : 5 ratio. If he uses 6 gallons of green paint, how many gallons of paint does he use total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much paint Andy is using in total based on the ratio given. The ratio of blue : green : white paint is 1 : 2 : 5. This means that for every 1 gallon of blue paint, Andy uses 2 gallons of green paint and 5 gallons of white paint. Since we know that Andy is using 6 gallons of green paint, we can use this information to find out how much of the other colors he is using. 2 gallons of green paint is equivalent to 1 gallon of blue paint, so Andy is using 3 gallons of blue paint (since 6/2 = 3). 5 gallons of white paint is equivalent to 2.5 gallons of green paint, so Andy is using 30 gallons of white paint (since 6 x 5 = 30). Therefore, Andy is using a total of 6 + 3 + 30 = 39 gallons of paint. The answer is 39.\n\n\nQ: There are 50 marbles in a box which has a mixture of white, red and blue marbles. There were originally 20 white marbles and an equal number of red and blue marbles. Jack removes a number of marbles equal to double the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles. How many marbles are left in the box?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 20 white marbles and an equal number of red and blue marbles. So, we can say that there are 20 white, 15 red, and 15 blue marbles in the box. Next, we need to find the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles. In this case, the difference is 20 - 15 = 5. Then, we need to double that difference, which gives us 5 x 2 = 10. Jack removes 10 marbles from the box. So, the number of marbles left in the box is 50 - 10 = 40 marbles. The answer is 40.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: June made a design with 20 equal tiles. Three tiles are yellow and the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles. Six tiles are purple and the remaining tiles are white.  How many white tiles are there?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 3 yellow tiles. Next, we know that the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles, so there are 3+1=4 blue tiles. Then, we know that there are 6 purple tiles. So far, we have accounted for 3+4+6=13 tiles. Since there are 20 tiles in total, we can subtract 13 from 20 to find the number of white tiles: 20-13=7 Therefore, there are 7 white tiles in June's design. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Hanna has twice as many erasers as Rachel.  Rachel has three less than one-half as many erasers as Tanya has red erasers.  If Tanya has 20 erasers, and half of them are red, how many erasers does Hanna have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red erasers Tanya has. We know that half of her erasers are red, so: 20/2 = 10 red erasers Next, we need to figure out how many erasers Rachel has. We know that Rachel has three less than one-half as many erasers as Tanya has red erasers, so: (1/2) * 20 - 3 = 7 erasers Finally, we need to find out how many erasers Hanna has, since we know she has twice as many as Rachel. Therefore: 2 * 7 = 14 erasers So, Hanna has 14 erasers. The answer is 14.\n\n\nQ: Don can paint 3 tiles a minute, Ken can paint 2 more tiles a minute than Don and Laura can paint twice as many tiles as Ken. Kim can paint 3 fewer tiles than Laura can in a minute. How many tiles can Don, Ken, Laura and Kim paint in 15 minutes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many tiles each person can paint in one minute. Don can paint 3 tiles a minute. Ken can paint 2 more tiles a minute than Don, so Ken can paint 3 + 2 = 5 tiles a minute. Laura can paint twice as many tiles as Ken, so Laura can paint 5 x 2 = 10 tiles a minute. Kim can paint 3 fewer tiles than Laura can in a minute, so Kim can paint 10 - 3 = 7 tiles a minute. Now that we know how many tiles each person can paint in one minute, we can multiply that by 15 to find out how many tiles they can paint in 15 minutes. Don can paint 3 x 15 = 45 tiles in 15 minutes. Ken can paint 5 x 15 = 75 tiles in 15 minutes. Laura can paint 10 x 15 = 150 tiles in 15 minutes. Kim can paint 7 x 15 = 105 tiles in 15 minutes. Therefore, Don can paint 45 tiles, Ken can paint 75 tiles, Laura can paint 150 tiles, and Kim can paint 105 tiles in 15 minutes. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Sally, Sam, and Steve went to play with their marbles. In the beginning, Sam has twice as many marbles as Steve while Sally has 5 less than Sam. After Sam has given Sally and Steve 3 marbles each, Sam has 8 marbles left. How many marbles does Steve have now?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Sam had in the beginning. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve, so let's call the number of marbles Steve had \"x\". This means that Sam had 2x marbles. Next, we know that Sally had 5 less marbles than Sam, so Sally had 2x - 5 marbles. After Sam gave 3 marbles each to Sally and Steve, he was left with 8 marbles. This means that he gave away a total of 6 marbles (3 to Sally and 3 to Steve), so he must have started with 14 marbles (8 + 6 = 14). Now we can use this information to figure out how many marbles Steve has. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve in the beginning, so if Sam had 14 marbles, Steve must have had 7 marbles (14 \u00f7 2 = 7). After Sam gave Steve 3 marbles, Steve now has 10 marbles (7 + 3 = 10). The answer is 10.\n\n\n"
