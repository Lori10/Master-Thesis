  "test_question": "Q: John injured his back and needs to go to physical therapy.  He went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.  Each week he went twice for 2 hours at a time.  If the sessions cost $125 per hour how much did the physical therapy cost?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Mark loves to see shows in theaters. He decided to visit the theater at least once a week. One performance lasts 3 hours. The price of the ticket depends on the time spent in the theater and stands at $5 for each hour. How much will Mark spend on visits to the theater in 6 weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many performances Mark will attend in 6 weeks. Since he wants to visit the theater at least once a week, we can multiply the number of weeks by 1: 6 weeks x 1 performance per week = 6 performances Next, we need to calculate the cost of each performance. We know that one performance lasts 3 hours, so the cost of one performance will be: 3 hours x $5 per hour = $15 Finally, we can calculate the total cost of all 6 performances by multiplying the cost of one performance by the number of performances: $15 per performance x 6 performances = $90 Therefore, Mark will spend $90 on visits to the theater in 6 weeks. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: John adopts a dog from a shelter.  The dog ends up having health problems and this requires 3 vet appointments,  which cost $400 each.  After the first appointment, John paid $100 for pet insurance that covers 80% of the subsequent visits.  How much did he pay in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, John paid $400 for the first vet appointment. Then, he paid $100 for pet insurance that covers 80% of the subsequent visits. This means that for the next two vet appointments, he will only have to pay 20% of the cost. So for the second and third vet appointments, John will pay: 20% of $400 = $80 Therefore, the total cost for the three vet appointments will be: $400 (first appointment) + $80 (second appointment) + $80 (third appointment) = $560 So John paid a total of $560 for the three vet appointments. The answer is 560.\n\n\nQ: Jerry works as an independent contractor for a company that pays him $40 per task. If each task takes him two hours to complete and he works 10 hours a day for a whole week, calculate the total amount of money he would earn at the end of the week.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many tasks Jerry can complete in a day. Since each task takes him two hours to complete, he can complete 10/2 = 5 tasks in a day. Next, we need to find out how many tasks Jerry can complete in a week. Since he works 10 hours a day for a whole week, he works a total of 10*7 = 70 hours in a week. Therefore, he can complete 70/2 = 35 tasks in a week. Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money Jerry would earn at the end of the week. Since he earns $40 per task, he would earn a total of 40*35 = $1400 at the end of the week. The answer is 1400.\n\n\nQ: Gnuff charges a flat rate of $20 per tutoring session plus $7 per minute. The total amount paid for Gnuff for tutoring for one session is $146. How many minutes did Gnuff tutor for?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Gnuff charges a flat rate of $20 per tutoring session. Let's call the number of minutes he tutored for \"m\". So the total cost of the tutoring session can be represented as: Total cost = flat rate + (cost per minute x number of minutes) Total cost = $20 + ($7 x m) We also know that the total amount paid for the tutoring session was $146. So we can set up an equation: $146 = $20 + ($7 x m) Now we can solve for \"m\": $126 = $7 x m m = 18 Therefore, Gnuff tutored for 18 minutes. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: An archer needs to practice.  He intends to shoot 200 shots 4 days a week.  He is able to recover 20% of his arrows.  The arrows he uses cost $5.5 per arrow.  His team agrees to pay for 70% of the cost of his arrows.  How much does he spend for arrows a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many arrows the archer uses in a week. He shoots 200 arrows per day, 4 days a week, so he shoots a total of 200 x 4 = 800 arrows per week. Next, we need to find out how many arrows he is able to recover. He is able to recover 20% of his arrows, which is 0.2 x 800 = 160 arrows. So, he actually uses 800 - 160 = 640 arrows per week. Now, we can calculate the cost of the arrows he uses. Each arrow costs $5.5, so the total cost of the arrows he uses is 640 x $5.5 = $3520. Finally, we need to find out how much he actually spends on arrows per week, taking into account that his team pays for 70% of the cost. His team pays for 70% of $3520, which is 0.7 x $3520 = $2464. Therefore, the archer spends $3520 - $2464 = $1056 on arrows per week. The answer is 1056.\n\n\nQ: Mr. Sean has a veterinary clinic where he charges clients $60 to treat a dog and $40 to care for a cat. If Khalil took 20 dogs and 60 cats to the clinic for treatment, how much money did he pay Mr. Sean?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of treating 20 dogs. 20 dogs x $60/dog = $1200 Next, we need to calculate the cost of caring for 60 cats. 60 cats x $40/cat = $2400 Finally, we add the cost of treating the dogs and caring for the cats to find the total cost. $1200 + $2400 = $3600 Therefore, Khalil paid Mr. Sean $3600 for treating 20 dogs and 60 cats. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Larry jogs for 30 minutes each day. In the first week, he jogs for 3 days while he jogs for 5 days in the second week. How many hours does he jog in total for two weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days Larry jogs in two weeks. Larry jogs for 3 days in the first week and 5 days in the second week, so he jogs for a total of 3 + 5 = 8 days in two weeks. Next, we need to find out how many hours Larry jogs in one day. Larry jogs for 30 minutes each day, which is equivalent to 0.5 hours. Finally, we can calculate how many hours Larry jogs in total for two weeks by multiplying the number of days by the number of hours per day: 8 days x 0.5 hours per day = 4 hours Therefore, Larry jogs for a total of 4 hours in two weeks. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Jamie and Oliver are planning to go on a vacation. A plane ticket costs $24 for each person and a hotel stay costs $12 for each person per day. How much money will they spend on the vacation if they stay for 3 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets for both Jamie and Oliver. Since each ticket costs $24, the total cost of the tickets will be: $24 x 2 = $48 Next, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel stay. Since the cost is $12 per person per day, and they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel stay will be: $12 x 2 x 3 = $72 Finally, we need to add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay to get the total cost of the vacation: $48 + $72 = $120 Therefore, Jamie and Oliver will spend $120 on their vacation. The answer is 120.\n\n\n"
