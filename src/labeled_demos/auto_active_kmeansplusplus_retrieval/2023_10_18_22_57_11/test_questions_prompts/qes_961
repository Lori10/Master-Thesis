  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Brenda volunteered to make 3 trays of banana pudding for the family reunion.  Each tray of banana pudding would need 80 wafer cookies.  A box of wafer cookies only had 60 cookies per box.  Each box costs $3.50.  How much will it cost her to buy just enough boxes for 3 trays of banana pudding?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many wafer cookies Brenda needs in total. She needs 80 cookies per tray and she's making 3 trays, so she needs: 80 x 3 = 240 wafer cookies Next, we need to figure out how many boxes of cookies she needs to buy. Each box has 60 cookies, so we can divide the total number of cookies needed by the number of cookies per box: 240 \u00f7 60 = 4 boxes So Brenda needs to buy 4 boxes of cookies. Each box costs $3.50, so we can multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box: 4 x $3.50 = $14 Therefore, it will cost Brenda $14 to buy just enough boxes for 3 trays of banana pudding. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: There were 90 jellybeans in a jar. Samantha snuck 24 jellybeans out of the jar, without being seen. Shelby ate 12 jellybeans from the jar. Their mom, Shannon, refilled the jar with half as much as Samantha and Shelby took out. How many jellybeans are in the jar now?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Samantha took out 24 jellybeans from the jar. Step 2: Shelby ate 12 jellybeans from the jar. Step 3: The total number of jellybeans taken out of the jar is 24 + 12 = 36. Step 4: Shannon refilled the jar with half as much as Samantha and Shelby took out, which is 1/2 * 36 = 18 jellybeans. Step 5: The total number of jellybeans in the jar now is 90 - 36 + 18 = 72 jellybeans. Therefore, there are 72 jellybeans in the jar now. The answer is 72.\n\n\nQ: James takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces.  He splits the pieces between 4 people.  If an orange has 80 calories how many calories does each person get?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pieces James has in total. He takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces, so he has 5 x 8 = 40 pieces in total. Next, we need to divide the pieces between 4 people. To do this, we can divide the total number of pieces by 4: 40 \u00f7 4 = 10 pieces per person. Finally, we need to find out how many calories each person gets. We know that one orange has 80 calories, so each piece has 80 \u00f7 8 = 10 calories. Therefore, each person gets 10 x 10 = 100 calories. So each person gets 100 calories. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Harry uses a whole bag of chocolate chips when he makes dough for chocolate chip cookies. The dough makes three batches of cookies, and each cookie has nine chocolate chips in it. A bag of chocolate chips has 81 chips in it. How many cookies are in a batch?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Harry uses a whole bag of chocolate chips for three batches of cookies. So, we can divide the number of chips in a bag by 3 to find out how many chips are in each batch: 81 chips / 3 batches = 27 chips per batch Next, we know that each cookie has 9 chocolate chips in it. So, we can divide the number of chips per batch by 9 to find out how many cookies are in each batch: 27 chips per batch / 9 chips per cookie = 3 cookies per batch Therefore, there are 3 cookies in each batch. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Valerie\u2019s cookie recipe makes 16 dozen cookies and calls for 4 pounds of butter.  She only wants to make 4 dozen cookies for the weekend.  How many pounds of butter will she need?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cookies Valerie needs to make for the weekend. Since she only wants to make 4 dozen cookies, we can calculate that as: 4 dozen cookies = 4 x 12 = 48 cookies Next, we need to figure out how much butter is needed for 16 dozen cookies. If 16 dozen cookies require 4 pounds of butter, we can set up a proportion: 16 dozen cookies / 4 pounds of butter = 1 dozen cookies / x pounds of butter To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 16 dozen cookies * x pounds of butter = 4 pounds of butter * 1 dozen cookies 16x = 48 x = 3 Therefore, Valerie will need 3 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen cookies for the weekend. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Merry had 50 boxes of apples on Saturday and 25 boxes on Sunday. There were 10 apples in each box. If she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, how many boxes of apples are left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many apples Merry had in total. On Saturday, she had 50 boxes of apples, and each box had 10 apples, so she had 50 x 10 = 500 apples on Saturday. On Sunday, she had 25 boxes of apples, and each box had 10 apples, so she had 25 x 10 = 250 apples on Sunday. In total, she had 500 + 250 = 750 apples. Next, we need to find out how many apples she sold. We know that she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, so she must have had 750 - 720 = 30 apples left. Finally, we need to find out how many boxes of apples she has left. We know that there are 10 apples in each box, so she must have 30 / 10 = 3 boxes of apples left. Therefore, Merry has 3 boxes of apples left. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Susan is picking strawberries. She's trying to fill her basket, but out of every handful of 5 strawberries she can't help but eat one of them herself. If her basket holds 60 strawberries, how many berries will she actually pick before she fills it?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many strawberries Susan will pick in each handful. If she eats one out of every five, that means she will pick four out of every five. So, for every handful of 5 strawberries, she will pick 4. Next, we need to figure out how many handfuls of strawberries Susan will need to pick to fill her basket. If her basket holds 60 strawberries, and she picks 4 strawberries per handful, then she will need to pick 60/4 = 15 handfuls of strawberries. Finally, we need to figure out how many strawberries she will actually pick before she fills her basket. Since she eats one out of every five strawberries, that means she will eat 1/5 of the strawberries she picks. So, for every 5 strawberries she picks, she will eat one and keep four. Therefore, she will actually pick 15 x 5 = 75 strawberries before she fills her basket. The answer is 75.\n\n\nQ: Mary wants 144 cupcakes for her party. Mary has already made 36 cherry cupcakes, and 48 berry cupcakes. Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes for the rest. How much of each should she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Mary has already made: 36 cherry + 48 berry = 84 cupcakes Next, we need to figure out how many more cupcakes Mary needs to make: 144 total cupcakes - 84 cupcakes already made = 60 cupcakes Since Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, we can divide the remaining 60 cupcakes by 2: 60 cupcakes \u00f7 2 = 30 cupcakes of each flavor Therefore, Mary should make 30 chocolate cupcakes and 30 vanilla cupcakes to have a total of 144 cupcakes for her party. The answer is 144.\n\n\n"
