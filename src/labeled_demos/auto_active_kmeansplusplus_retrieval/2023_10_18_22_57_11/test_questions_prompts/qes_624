  "test_question": "Q: Leo collects stickers. Two years ago, he had 100 stickers in his collection. Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year. How many stickers does Leo have in his collection?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Mary bought a packet of 1500 stickers. She shared them between Susan, Andrew and Sam in the ratio 1:1:3 respectively. If Sam gave Andrew two-thirds of his own share, how many stickers does Andrew now have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 1+1+3=5. Next, we need to find the size of each part by dividing the total number of stickers by the total number of parts: 1500/5=300. So, Susan and Andrew each get one part, which is 300 stickers each. Sam gets three parts, which is 900 stickers. Now, we need to find out how many stickers Sam gave to Andrew. Two-thirds of Sam's share is (2/3)*900=600. Therefore, Andrew now has 300+600=900 stickers. The answer is 900.\n\n\nQ: Willy has 10 stuffed animals. His mom gives him 2 more stuffed animals for his birthday. After his birthday, if his dad gives him 3 times more stuffed animals than he has, how many stuffed animals does Willy have in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to add the 2 stuffed animals that Willy received from his mom to the 10 he already had: 10 + 2 = 12 Now we know that Willy has 12 stuffed animals. Next, we need to figure out how many stuffed animals Willy's dad gave him. We know that his dad gave him 3 times more stuffed animals than he already had, so we can multiply 12 by 3: 12 x 3 = 36 So Willy's dad gave him 36 stuffed animals. Finally, we can add the 12 stuffed animals Willy already had to the 36 his dad gave him: 12 + 36 = 48 Therefore, Willy has a total of 48 stuffed animals. The answer is 48.\n\n\nQ: Brandon sold 86 geckos last year. He sold twice that many the year before. How many geckos has Brandon sold in the last two years?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many geckos Brandon sold the year before. We know that he sold twice as many geckos as he did last year, so we can set up an equation: 2x = number of geckos sold the year before where x is the number of geckos sold last year. We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 2: x = number of geckos sold last year = 86/2 = 43 So Brandon sold 43 geckos last year and 2x geckos the year before. We can add these two numbers together to find the total number of geckos sold in the last two years: 43 + 2x = 43 + 2(43) = 43 + 86 = 129 Therefore, Brandon sold 129 geckos in the last two years. The answer is 129.\n\n\nQ: Tracy has been collecting novels from her friends to donate to the Children For The Future charity organization. In the first week she collects a certain number of books. In the next five weeks, she collects ten times as many books as she did in the first week. How many books did she collect in the first week if she has 99 books now?\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that Tracy collected x number of books in the first week. According to the problem, in the next five weeks, she collected ten times as many books as she did in the first week. So, in the next five weeks, she collected 10x books. Therefore, the total number of books she collected is x + 10x = 11x. We also know that she has 99 books now. So, we can set up an equation: 11x = 99 To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 11: x = 9 Therefore, Tracy collected 9 books in the first week. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Luke started working on a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle. The first day he worked on it, he put together 10% of the pieces. On the second day, he put together another 20% of the remaining pieces from the first day. On the third day, he put together 30% of the remaining pieces from the previous day. How many pieces does he have left to complete after the third day?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Luke put together 10% of the 1000 pieces, which is 100 pieces. So he has 900 pieces left. On the second day, he put together 20% of the remaining 900 pieces, which is 180 pieces. So he has 720 pieces left. On the third day, he put together 30% of the remaining 720 pieces, which is 216 pieces. So he has 504 pieces left. Therefore, after the third day, Luke has 504 pieces left to complete the puzzle. The answer is 504.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Lewis found 4 more items on the scavenger hunt than Samantha.  Samantha found four times the amount of items than Tanya who was only able to find 4 items.  How many items did Lewis find?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many items Samantha found. We know that Samantha found four times the amount of items than Tanya, who found 4 items. So Samantha found 4 x 4 = 16 items. Next, we know that Lewis found 4 more items than Samantha. So we can add 4 to Samantha's total: 16 + 4 = 20. Therefore, Lewis found 20 items on the scavenger hunt. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: James writes a comic every other day for 4 years. If there was no leap year, how many comics has he written?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days there are in 4 years. Since there are 365 days in a year, we can multiply 365 by 4 to get: 365 x 4 = 1460 days Next, we need to figure out how many comics James writes in every other day. Since he writes a comic every other day, we can divide the total number of days by 2 to get: 1460 / 2 = 730 comics Therefore, James has written 730 comics in 4 years if there was no leap year. The answer is 4.\n\n\n"
