  "test_question": "Q: Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year. Butler High School, the neighboring school, enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. How much greater is the average enrollment at Norman High School than the enrollment at Butler High School?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: There are 13 3-year-olds, 20 4-year-olds, 15 5-year-olds, and 22 six-year-olds at a particular Sunday school. If the 3 and 4-year-olds are in one class and the 5 and 6-year-olds are in another class, what is the average class size?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of students in each class. For the 3 and 4-year-olds class, we add the number of 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds: 13 + 20 = 33 For the 5 and 6-year-olds class, we add the number of 5-year-olds and 6-year-olds: 15 + 22 = 37 Next, we need to find the average class size. To do this, we add the total number of students in both classes and divide by the number of classes: (33 + 37) / 2 = 35 Therefore, the average class size is 35 students. The answer is 35.\n\n\nQ: Next year, there will be twice as many people going to the fair as are going this year, and the number of people who went to the fair last year was 200 less than those going next year. If the number of people going to the fair this year is 600, calculate the number of people at the fair in the three years.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the number of people going to the fair next year will be twice the number of people going this year. So, we can calculate: Number of people going to the fair next year = 2 * 600 = 1200 Next, we know that the number of people who went to the fair last year was 200 less than those going next year. So, we can calculate: Number of people who went to the fair last year = 1200 - 200 = 1000 Finally, we want to calculate the total number of people at the fair in the three years. So, we can add up the number of people going this year, next year, and last year: Total number of people at the fair in the three years = 600 + 1200 + 1000 = 2800 Therefore, there will be 2800 people at the fair in the three years. The answer is 2800.\n\n\nQ: Sun City has 1000 more than twice as many people as Roseville City. Roseville city has 500 less than thrice as many people as Willowdale city. If Willowdale city has 2000 people, how many people live in Sun City?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people live in Roseville City. We know that Roseville has 500 less than thrice as many people as Willowdale, which has 2000 people. So, we can calculate: Roseville City = 3 x Willowdale City - 500 Roseville City = 3 x 2000 - 500 Roseville City = 6000 - 500 Roseville City = 5500 Now we know that Roseville City has 5500 people. Next, we need to find out how many people live in Sun City. We know that Sun City has 1000 more than twice as many people as Roseville City. So, we can calculate: Sun City = 2 x Roseville City + 1000 Sun City = 2 x 5500 + 1000 Sun City = 11000 + 1000 Sun City = 12000 Therefore, there are 12000 people living in Sun City. The answer is 12000.\n\n\nQ: Aliya and her classmates are sent by their teacher to the field to collect insects for science class study. The Boys collected 200 insects and the girls collected 300 insects. The teacher decided to divide the class equally into four groups that each get an equal number of insects so that each group could study together. What was the number of insects given to each group?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of insects collected by the class. Total number of insects = 200 (boys) + 300 (girls) = 500 Step 2: Divide the total number of insects by the number of groups. Number of insects per group = 500 \u00f7 4 = 125 Step 3: Therefore, each group will get 125 insects to study. The answer is 125.\n\n\nQ: In a school, the number of participants in the 2018 Science Quiz Bowl was 150. There were 20 more than twice the number of participants in 2019 as there were in 2018. In 2020, the number of participants was 40 less than half the number of participants in 2019. How many more participants were there in 2019 than in 2020?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many participants there were in 2019. We know that there were 20 more than twice the number of participants in 2018, so we can set up an equation: 2019 participants = 20 + 2 * 2018 participants 2019 participants = 20 + 2 * 150 2019 participants = 320 Next, we need to find out how many participants there were in 2020. We know that the number of participants in 2020 was 40 less than half the number of participants in 2019, so we can set up another equation: 2020 participants = 0.5 * 2019 participants - 40 2020 participants = 0.5 * 320 - 40 2020 participants = 80 Finally, we can find out how many more participants there were in 2019 than in 2020: 2019 participants - 2020 participants = 320 - 80 = 240 Therefore, there were 240 more participants in 2019 than in 2020. The answer is 2020.\n\n\nQ: Forty percent of the students have elected to learn from home during the pandemic. The remaining students are divided into two equal groups, only one of which is physically in school on any day. What percent of students are present in school?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Let's assume that there are 100 students in total. Step 2: 40% of the students have elected to learn from home during the pandemic. So, the number of students learning from home is 40% of 100, which is 40. Step 3: The remaining students are 60 (100 - 40). Step 4: The remaining students are divided into two equal groups, so each group has 30 students. Step 5: Only one of the two groups is physically in school on any day. So, the number of students present in school is 30. Step 6: To find the percentage of students present in school, we need to divide the number of students present in school by the total number of students and multiply by 100. 30/100 x 100 = 30% Therefore, 30% of students are present in school. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: Malik rushed for 18 yards in each of 4 games. Josiah ran for 22 yards in each of 4 games. Darnell had an average of 11 yards rushed for each of the 4 games. How many yards did the 3 athletes run in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. Malik rushed for 18 yards in each of 4 games, so he ran a total of 18 x 4 = 72 yards. Josiah ran for 22 yards in each of 4 games, so he ran a total of 22 x 4 = 88 yards. Darnell had an average of 11 yards rushed for each of the 4 games, so he ran a total of 11 x 4 = 44 yards. To find the total yards run by the three athletes, we add up their individual totals: 72 + 88 + 44 = 204 yards. Therefore, the three athletes ran a total of 204 yards. The answer is 204.\n\n\nQ: A water tower that serves four neighborhoods around it holds 1200 barrels of water and is filled to the top each week. If one neighborhood uses 150 barrels of water in a week, the second neighborhood uses twice as many barrels of water as the first neighborhood in a week, and the third neighborhood uses one hundred more barrels of water than the second neighborhood in a week, how many barrels are left for the fourth neighborhood?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many barrels of water the second neighborhood uses in a week. We know that the first neighborhood uses 150 barrels, so the second neighborhood uses twice as many, which is 150 x 2 = 300 barrels. Next, we need to find out how many barrels of water the third neighborhood uses in a week. We know that the third neighborhood uses 100 more barrels than the second neighborhood, so that's 300 + 100 = 400 barrels. Now, we can add up the barrels of water used by the first three neighborhoods: 150 + 300 + 400 = 850 barrels. We know that the water tower holds 1200 barrels of water and is filled to the top each week, so to find out how many barrels are left for the fourth neighborhood, we can subtract the barrels used by the first three neighborhoods from the total capacity of the water tower: 1200 - 850 = 350 barrels. Therefore, the fourth neighborhood has 350 barrels of water left for the week. The answer is 350.\n\n\n"
