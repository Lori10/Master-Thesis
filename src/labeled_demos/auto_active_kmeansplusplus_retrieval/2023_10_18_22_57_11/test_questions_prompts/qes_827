  "formatted_prompt": "Q: James takes 2 Tylenol tablets that are 375 mg each, every 6 hours.  How many mg does he take a day?\nA: Let's think step by step. James takes 2 Tylenol tablets every 6 hours, which means he takes 4 tablets in a day (24 hours). Each tablet is 375 mg, so 4 tablets would be: 4 x 375 = 1500 mg Therefore, James takes 1500 mg of Tylenol a day. The answer is 1500.\n\n\nQ: Jeremy decides to take Tylenol because of the pain he is experiencing. He decides to take 1000 mg every 6 hours for 2 weeks.  How many pills do they take if they are each 500 mg?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many hours are in two weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 14 days. Next, we need to figure out how many times Jeremy will take Tylenol in 2 weeks. If he takes it every 6 hours, that means he will take it 4 times a day (24 hours divided by 6 hours). So, in 2 weeks, he will take it 4 times a day for 14 days, which is a total of 56 times. Now we need to figure out how many milligrams of Tylenol he will take each time. He is taking 1000 mg each time, so we don't need to do any further calculations. Finally, we need to figure out how many pills he will take. Each pill is 500 mg, so he will need to take 2 pills each time. Therefore, over the course of 2 weeks, he will take 56 times 2 pills, which is a total of 112 pills. The answer is 112.\n\n\nQ: Mark has a really bad headache.  He takes 2 Tylenol tablets of 500 mg each and he does every 4 hours for 12 hours.  How many grams of Tylenol does he end up taking?\nA: Let's think step by step. Mark takes 2 Tylenol tablets of 500 mg each every 4 hours for 12 hours. So, in 1 dose, he takes 2 tablets x 500 mg per tablet = 1000 mg of Tylenol. He takes this dose every 4 hours, so in 12 hours, he takes 12 hours / 4 hours per dose = 3 doses. Therefore, he takes a total of 3 doses x 1000 mg per dose = 3000 mg of Tylenol in 12 hours. To convert this to grams, we divide by 1000: 3000 mg / 1000 = 3 grams So, Mark ends up taking 3 grams of Tylenol in 12 hours. The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: John takes a pill every 6 hours.  How many pills does he take a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 24 hours in a day, so John takes 24/6 = 4 pills per day. In a week, there are 7 days, so John takes 4 x 7 = 28 pills per week. The answer is 28.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: Marly is making soup. He adds 2 quarts of milk and three times as much chicken stock to 1 quart of pureed vegetables. Then he divides the soup into bags that can hold 3 quarts each. How many bags does he need?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Marly adds 2 quarts of milk and three times as much chicken stock to 1 quart of pureed vegetables. This means he adds 2 + 3(1) = 5 quarts of liquid to the vegetables. Next, Marly has a total of 5 + 1 = 6 quarts of soup. To find out how many bags he needs, we need to divide the total amount of soup by the amount each bag can hold. So, we have: 6 quarts \u00f7 3 quarts/bag = 2 bags Therefore, Marly needs 2 bags to hold all of his soup. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: One serving of soup has 1 cup of vegetables and 2.5 cups of broth. How many pints of vegetables and broth combined would be needed for 8 servings?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total amount of soup in cups for 8 servings. One serving has 1 cup of vegetables and 2.5 cups of broth, so one serving of soup is 1 + 2.5 = 3.5 cups. To find the total amount of soup for 8 servings, we can multiply the amount for one serving by 8: 3.5 cups/serving x 8 servings = 28 cups of soup Now we need to find the amount of pints in 28 cups. There are 2 cups in a pint, so we can divide 28 cups by 2 to get the amount in pints: 28 cups \u00f7 2 cups/pint = 14 pints Therefore, we would need 14 pints of vegetables and broth combined for 8 servings of soup. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: A vampire needs to suck 7 gallons of blood per week to survive.  If he sucks 2 pints of blood per person, how many people does he need to suck each day to survive?\nA: Let's think step by step. 1 gallon = 8 pints (since 1 gallon = 128 fluid ounces and 1 fluid ounce = 0.125 pints) So, 7 gallons = 7 x 8 = 56 pints The vampire needs to suck 56 pints of blood per week to survive. 2 pints of blood per person To find out how many people the vampire needs to suck each day, we need to divide 56 by the number of days in a week (7). 56/7 = 8 Therefore, the vampire needs to suck blood from 8 people each day to survive. The answer is 8.\n\n\n"
