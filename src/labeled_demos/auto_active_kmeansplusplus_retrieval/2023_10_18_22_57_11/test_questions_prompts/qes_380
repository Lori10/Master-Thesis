  "test_question": "Q: Dylan attended a wedding where there were 100 guests in the reception. Each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door as a thank you for helping in the wedding reception.

  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Dani brings two and half dozen cupcakes for her 2nd-grade class.  There are 27 students (including Dani), 1 teacher, and 1 teacher\u2019s aid.  If 3 students called in sick that day, how many cupcakes are left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Dani brought in total. Two and a half dozen cupcakes is equal to 30 cupcakes (since a dozen is 12). Next, we need to figure out how many people will be receiving cupcakes. There are 27 students, 1 teacher, and 1 teacher's aid, for a total of 29 people. However, 3 students called in sick, so we need to subtract them from the total. 29 - 3 = 26 people receiving cupcakes. Now, we need to subtract 26 cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes Dani brought. 30 - 26 = 4 cupcakes left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: A bakery sells boxes of doughnuts and if there are any doughnuts left at the end of the day, the bakery gives them away. Each box of doughnuts holds 10 doughnuts and all of the doughnuts that the bakery makes are put into these boxes. The bakery makes 300 doughnuts for the day and sells 27 boxes of doughnuts throughout the day. How many doughnuts are given away at the end of the day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many doughnuts were sold during the day. We know that each box contains 10 doughnuts, so 27 boxes would contain 27 x 10 = 270 doughnuts. Next, we can subtract the number of doughnuts sold from the total number of doughnuts made to find out how many were left over. 300 - 270 = 30 Therefore, there are 30 doughnuts left at the end of the day that will be given away. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: Brenda volunteered to make 3 trays of banana pudding for the family reunion.  Each tray of banana pudding would need 80 wafer cookies.  A box of wafer cookies only had 60 cookies per box.  Each box costs $3.50.  How much will it cost her to buy just enough boxes for 3 trays of banana pudding?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many wafer cookies Brenda needs in total. She needs 80 cookies per tray and she's making 3 trays, so she needs: 80 x 3 = 240 wafer cookies Next, we need to figure out how many boxes of cookies she needs to buy. Each box has 60 cookies, so we can divide the total number of cookies needed by the number of cookies per box: 240 \u00f7 60 = 4 boxes So Brenda needs to buy 4 boxes of cookies. Each box costs $3.50, so we can multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box: 4 x $3.50 = $14 Therefore, it will cost Brenda $14 to buy just enough boxes for 3 trays of banana pudding. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Cristine bought a dozen lemons and gave 1/4 of them to her neighbor. How many lemons does Cristine have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine how many lemons are in a dozen. A dozen is equal to 12, so Cristine bought 12 lemons. Next, we need to figure out how many lemons Cristine gave to her neighbor. She gave away 1/4 of the lemons, which means she gave away 1/4 x 12 = 3 lemons. To find out how many lemons Cristine has left, we need to subtract the number of lemons she gave away from the total number of lemons she bought. 12 - 3 = 9 Therefore, Cristine has 9 lemons left. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Mary wants 144 cupcakes for her party. Mary has already made 36 cherry cupcakes, and 48 berry cupcakes. Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes for the rest. How much of each should she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Mary has already made: 36 cherry + 48 berry = 84 cupcakes Next, we need to figure out how many more cupcakes Mary needs to make: 144 total cupcakes - 84 cupcakes already made = 60 cupcakes Since Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, we can divide the remaining 60 cupcakes by 2: 60 cupcakes \u00f7 2 = 30 cupcakes of each flavor Therefore, Mary should make 30 chocolate cupcakes and 30 vanilla cupcakes to have a total of 144 cupcakes for her party. The answer is 144.\n\n\nQ: Harry uses a whole bag of chocolate chips when he makes dough for chocolate chip cookies. The dough makes three batches of cookies, and each cookie has nine chocolate chips in it. A bag of chocolate chips has 81 chips in it. How many cookies are in a batch?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Harry uses a whole bag of chocolate chips for three batches of cookies. So, we can divide the number of chips in a bag by 3 to find out how many chips are in each batch: 81 chips / 3 batches = 27 chips per batch Next, we know that each cookie has 9 chocolate chips in it. So, we can divide the number of chips per batch by 9 to find out how many cookies are in each batch: 27 chips per batch / 9 chips per cookie = 3 cookies per batch Therefore, there are 3 cookies in each batch. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Dylan's mother is throwing a baby shower for her best friend. She is expecting 40 guests, of whom she has cleared the parking lot to park in to, leaving only her car and her husband's jeep in the parking lot. The 40 guests, though, arrive in only 10 cars that they park in the parking lot.  If each car has 4 wheels, how many car wheels are there in the parking lot, including both of Dylan's parent's car wheels?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many wheels the 10 cars have in total. Since each car has 4 wheels, we can multiply 10 by 4 to get: 10 x 4 = 40 So, the 10 cars have a total of 40 wheels. Next, we need to add the wheels of Dylan's parent's cars. Since we know they have one car and one jeep, we can calculate the total number of wheels by adding the number of wheels for each vehicle. A car has 4 wheels and a jeep has 4 wheels, so we can add: 4 + 4 = 8 Therefore, there are a total of 40 + 8 = 48 wheels in the parking lot, including both of Dylan's parent's car wheels. The answer is 48.\n\n\nQ: A teacher is making packed lunches for a field trip. Each student needs 2 sandwiches, and will travel in a group with 5 other students. There are a total of 5 groups. How many pieces of bread will the teacher need to make enough sandwiches for all the students?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of students going on the field trip. Since each group has 6 students (1 student + 5 others), and there are 5 groups, the total number of students is: 6 students/group x 5 groups = 30 students Step 2: Find the total number of sandwiches needed. Since each student needs 2 sandwiches, the total number of sandwiches needed is: 2 sandwiches/student x 30 students = 60 sandwiches Step 3: Find the total number of bread slices needed. Since each sandwich has 2 slices of bread, the total number of bread slices needed is: 2 slices/sandwich x 60 sandwiches = 120 slices of bread Therefore, the teacher will need 120 slices of bread to make enough sandwiches for all the students. The answer is 120.\n\n\n"
