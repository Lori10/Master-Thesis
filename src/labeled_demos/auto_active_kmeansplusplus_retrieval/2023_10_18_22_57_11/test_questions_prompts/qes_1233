  "test_question": "Q: To heat during the winter, Ali ordered 850 kilos of coal. The coal is delivered in 50 kg bags, costing $18 per unit. How much does his order cost?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Betty bought 1 kg of oranges and 3 kg of apples. The total cost of oranges was $12. The apples were two times cheaper than the oranges. How much did Betty pay for 1 kg of apples?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the total cost of oranges was $12. We don't know the cost per kilogram of oranges, but we can figure it out by dividing the total cost by the amount of oranges Betty bought: Cost per kilogram of oranges = $12 \u00f7 1 kg = $12/kg Next, we know that the apples were two times cheaper than the oranges. This means that the cost per kilogram of apples is half the cost per kilogram of oranges: Cost per kilogram of apples = 1/2 \u00d7 $12/kg = $6/kg Therefore, Betty paid $6 for 1 kg of apples. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Chad is hosting a BBQ on the hottest day of the year, where there will be a total of 15 people.  He will need 2 pounds of ice per person to account for the heat.  One pound bags of ice are sold for $3.00 for a pack of 10.  How much will he spend on ice?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pounds of ice Chad will need in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of people by the amount of ice needed per person: 15 people x 2 pounds/person = 30 pounds of ice Next, we need to figure out how many packs of ice Chad will need to buy. Since each pack contains 10 one-pound bags of ice, we can divide the total pounds needed by 10: 30 pounds of ice \u00f7 10 bags/pack = 3 packs of ice Finally, we can calculate the total cost of the ice by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack: 3 packs x $3.00/pack = $9.00 Therefore, Chad will spend $9.00 on ice for his BBQ. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Joseph has a refrigerator, a water heater in his house, and an electric oven that consumes power at different rates. The total amount of money that Joseph pays for the energy used by the refrigerator is three times the amount he pays for the power used by the water heater. If the electric oven uses power worth $500 in a month, twice what Joseph pays for the power the water heater uses, calculate the total amount he pays for the power used by these gadgets.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much Joseph pays for the power used by the water heater. We know that the electric oven uses power worth $500 in a month, twice what Joseph pays for the power the water heater uses. So, if the power used by the water heater is x, then we can write: 2x = $500 Solving for x, we get: x = $250 Now we know that Joseph pays $250 for the power used by the water heater. We also know that the total amount of money that Joseph pays for the energy used by the refrigerator is three times the amount he pays for the power used by the water heater. So, if the power used by the water heater is x, then the power used by the refrigerator is 3x. Therefore, the total amount Joseph pays for the power used by these gadgets is: $250 + $500 + 3x Substituting x = $250, we get: $250 + $500 + 3($250) = $1,500 Therefore, Joseph pays a total of $1,500 for the power used by the refrigerator, water heater, and electric oven. The answer is 1500.\n\n\nQ: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of 18 watermelons. Since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, the total weight of 18 watermelons would be: 23 x 18 = 414 pounds Next, we need to find the total amount of money Farmer Kent would make by selling these watermelons. Since he sells them for $2 a pound, we can multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 414 x $2 = $828 Therefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: A charcoal grill burns fifteen coals to ash every twenty minutes of grilling. The grill ran for long enough to burn three bags of coals. Each bag of coal contains 60 coals. How long did the grill run?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many coals were burned in total. Since each bag contains 60 coals, and there were three bags, the total number of coals burned is: 60 coals/bag * 3 bags = 180 coals Next, we need to figure out how many sets of 15 coals were burned. We can do this by dividing the total number of coals burned by 15: 180 coals / 15 coals/set = 12 sets So, the grill burned 15 coals every 20 minutes, and it burned 12 sets of 15 coals, which means it ran for: 12 sets * 20 minutes/set = 240 minutes Therefore, the grill ran for 240 minutes or 4 hours. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: One kilogram of tomatoes is 20% cheaper than one kilogram of cucumbers. One kilogram of cucumbers costs $5. What is the price of two kilograms of tomatoes and three kilograms of cucumbers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the price of one kilogram of tomatoes. We know that it is 20% cheaper than one kilogram of cucumbers, which costs $5. 20% of $5 is $1, so one kilogram of tomatoes costs $5 - $1 = $4. Next, we need to find the price of two kilograms of tomatoes. Two kilograms of tomatoes would cost 2 x $4 = $8. Finally, we need to find the price of three kilograms of cucumbers. Three kilograms of cucumbers would cost 3 x $5 = $15. Therefore, the total price of two kilograms of tomatoes and three kilograms of cucumbers is $8 + $15 = $23. The answer is 23.\n\n\nQ: Harris feeds his dog 1 large organic carrot over the course of 1 day.  There are 5 carrots in a 1 pound bag and each bag costs $2.00.  In one year, how much will Harris spend on carrots?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many pounds of carrots Harris will need in a year. Since he feeds his dog 1 carrot per day, he will need 365 carrots in a year. Next, we need to figure out how many bags of carrots he will need. If there are 5 carrots in a bag, then he will need 365/5 = 73 bags of carrots in a year. Finally, we can calculate the cost of the carrots. Each bag costs $2.00, so 73 bags will cost 73 x $2.00 = $146.00. Therefore, Harris will spend $146.00 on carrots in one year. The answer is 146.\n\n\nQ: To buy a book, you pay $20 for each of the first 5 books at the supermarket, and for each additional book you buy over $20, you receive a discount of $2. If Beatrice bought 20 books, how much did she pay at the supermarket?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the first 5 books, which is simply: $20 x 5 = $100 Next, we need to calculate the cost of the remaining 15 books. Since Beatrice gets a $2 discount for each book over $20, we can calculate the cost of each book as: $20 - $2 = $18 Therefore, the cost of the remaining 15 books is: $18 x 15 = $270 Finally, we can calculate the total cost by adding the cost of the first 5 books to the cost of the remaining 15 books: $100 + $270 = $370 Therefore, Beatrice paid $370 at the supermarket for 20 books. The answer is 20.\n\n\n"
