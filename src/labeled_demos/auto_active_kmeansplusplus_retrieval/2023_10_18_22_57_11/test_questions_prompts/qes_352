  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Phoebe has two pizzas to share with her and three friends. One has pepperoni and the other has cheese. They both have 16 slices. They all eat the same amount. One friend eats only pepperoni, while the rest have an equal number of slices of each. At the end, there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese, how many slices does each person eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 2 pizzas with 16 slices each, so there are a total of 32 slices. Next, we know that one friend only eats pepperoni, so they eat one slice from the pepperoni pizza. That leaves 31 slices, with 15 slices from each pizza. We also know that there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese left. So, the remaining 15 slices are divided equally among the remaining 3 friends, which means each of them eats 5 slices. Therefore, each person eats 1 slice of pepperoni and 5 slices of cheese. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Phill cuts the pizza in half, which gives him 2 slices. Then he cuts both halves in half, which gives him 4 slices. And then he cuts each slice in half again, which gives him 8 slices in total. Next, Phill passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends, which means he gives away 3 slices in total. He also passes out 2 slices to 2 of his friends, which means he gives away 4 slices in total. Therefore, Phill has given away a total of 7 slices of pizza. If he started with 8 slices, then he has 1 slice left for himself. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Cassandra bought four dozen Granny Smith apples and used them to make four apple pies.  She cut each pie into 6 large pieces.  How many apples are in each slice of pie?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Determine the total number of apples Cassandra bought. - One dozen is equal to 12, so four dozen is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 apples. Step 2: Determine the total number of pieces of pie Cassandra made. - Each pie was cut into 6 pieces, so four pies would be cut into 4 x 6 = 24 pieces. Step 3: Determine the number of apples in each slice of pie. - To do this, we need to divide the total number of apples by the total number of pieces of pie. - 48 apples / 24 pieces = 2 apples per slice of pie. Therefore, there are 2 apples in each slice of pie. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: A pie shop charges $5 for a slice of pie. They cut each whole pie into 4 slices. How much money will the pie shop make if they sell 9 pies?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of pie are in 9 whole pies. Since each pie is cut into 4 slices, we can multiply 9 by 4 to get the total number of slices: 9 x 4 = 36 So there are 36 slices of pie in 9 whole pies. Next, we need to find out how much money the pie shop will make if they sell all 36 slices. Each slice costs $5, so we can multiply 36 by 5 to get the total amount of money: 36 x 5 = 180 Therefore, the pie shop will make $180 if they sell 9 whole pies, each cut into 4 slices, at $5 per slice. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Mary bought a packet of 1500 stickers. She shared them between Susan, Andrew and Sam in the ratio 1:1:3 respectively. If Sam gave Andrew two-thirds of his own share, how many stickers does Andrew now have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 1+1+3=5. Next, we need to find the size of each part by dividing the total number of stickers by the total number of parts: 1500/5=300. So, Susan and Andrew each get one part, which is 300 stickers each. Sam gets three parts, which is 900 stickers. Now, we need to find out how many stickers Sam gave to Andrew. Two-thirds of Sam's share is (2/3)*900=600. Therefore, Andrew now has 300+600=900 stickers. The answer is 900.\n\n\nQ: GiGi took out a big bowl of mushrooms from the refrigerator.  She cut each mushroom into 4 pieces.  Her twins, Kenny and Karla sprinkled mushrooms on their pizzas and baked them in the oven.  Kenny grabbed a handful and sprinkled 38 mushroom pieces on his pizza.  Karla scooped them up with both hands and sprinkled 42 mushroom pieces on her pizza.  On the cutting board, were 8 pieces of mushrooms remaining.  How many mushrooms did GiGi cut up at the beginning?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that GiGi cut up a certain number of mushrooms into 4 pieces each. Let's call the total number of mushrooms she cut up \"x\". Next, we know that Kenny sprinkled 38 mushroom pieces on his pizza. Since each mushroom was cut into 4 pieces, this means he used 38/4 = 9.5 mushrooms. However, since he can't use half a mushroom, we know he used 9 mushrooms. Similarly, Karla used 42/4 = 10.5 mushrooms, but since she can't use half a mushroom, we know she used 10 mushrooms. So far, we know that Kenny and Karla used a total of 9+10 = 19 mushrooms. Finally, we know that there were 8 pieces of mushrooms left on the cutting board. Since each mushroom was cut into 4 pieces, this means there were 8/4 = 2 mushrooms left. To find the total number of mushrooms GiGi cut up at the beginning, we can add up the number of mushrooms used by Kenny and Karla, plus the number of mushrooms left on the cutting board: x = 19 + 2 = 21 Therefore, GiGi cut up 21 mushrooms at the beginning. The answer is 21.\n\n\nQ: Cristine bought a dozen lemons and gave 1/4 of them to her neighbor. How many lemons does Cristine have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine how many lemons are in a dozen. A dozen is equal to 12, so Cristine bought 12 lemons. Next, we need to figure out how many lemons Cristine gave to her neighbor. She gave away 1/4 of the lemons, which means she gave away 1/4 x 12 = 3 lemons. To find out how many lemons Cristine has left, we need to subtract the number of lemons she gave away from the total number of lemons she bought. 12 - 3 = 9 Therefore, Cristine has 9 lemons left. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Mary has 26 blue shirts and 36 brown shirts. If she gives away half of her blue shirts and a third of her brown shirts, how many shirts does she have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many blue shirts Mary gives away. Half of her blue shirts would be: 26 / 2 = 13 So Mary gives away 13 blue shirts. Next, we need to find out how many brown shirts Mary gives away. A third of her brown shirts would be: 36 / 3 = 12 So Mary gives away 12 brown shirts. Now we can find out how many shirts Mary has left. She started with 26 blue shirts and gave away 13, so she has: 26 - 13 = 13 blue shirts left She started with 36 brown shirts and gave away 12, so she has: 36 - 12 = 24 brown shirts left Therefore, Mary has 13 + 24 = 37 shirts left. The answer is 37.\n\n\n"
