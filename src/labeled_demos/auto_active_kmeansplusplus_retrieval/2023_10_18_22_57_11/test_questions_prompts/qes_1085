  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Tonya is buying Christmas gifts for her sisters. She has 2 sisters and wants to spend the exact same amount on each. She buys her younger sister 4 dolls that cost $15 each. She plans to buy lego sets for her older sister. They cost $20 each. How many lego sets does she buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much Tonya spent on dolls for her younger sister. She bought 4 dolls that cost $15 each, so she spent: 4 x $15 = $60 Since Tonya wants to spend the same amount on each sister, she needs to spend $60 on lego sets for her older sister as well. Each lego set costs $20, so she needs to buy: $60 \u00f7 $20 = 3 lego sets Therefore, Tonya needs to buy 3 lego sets for her older sister. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Oliver had $9, then he saved $5 from his allowance and spent $4 on a frisbee and $3 on a puzzle. His friend gives him another $8 as it's his birthday. How much money does Oliver have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. Oliver had $9. He saved $5 from his allowance, so he now has $9 + $5 = $14. He spent $4 on a frisbee, so he now has $14 - $4 = $10. He spent another $3 on a puzzle, so he now has $10 - $3 = $7. His friend gives him another $8, so he now has $7 + $8 = $15. Therefore, Oliver has $15 left. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Michael has $42. Michael gives away half the money to his brother. His brother then buys 3 dollars worth of candy. If his brother has $35 left, how much money, in dollars, did his brother have at first?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Michael had $42. Next, he gave away half of that money to his brother, which is $21. His brother then spent $3 on candy, leaving him with $35. To figure out how much money his brother had at first, we need to work backwards. If his brother had $35 after spending $3 on candy, then he had $38 before buying the candy. And if his brother received $21 from Michael, then he must have had $17 to begin with. Therefore, his brother had $17 at first. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: John buys game loot boxes for $5 each.  The average value of items inside is $3.5.   He spends $40 on loot boxes.  What is the average amount he lost?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many loot boxes John bought. We can do this by dividing the total amount he spent by the cost of each loot box: 40 / 5 = 8 So John bought 8 loot boxes. Next, we need to find out the total value of the items inside all the loot boxes. We can do this by multiplying the average value of each box by the number of boxes: 3.5 x 8 = 28 So the total value of the items inside all the loot boxes is $28. Finally, we can find out the average amount John lost by subtracting the total value of the items from the total amount he spent: 40 - 28 = 12 So John lost an average of $12 on each loot box. The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: Marco has $24. Mary has $15. If Marco gives Mary half of what he has, Mary will have more than Marco. But Mary spends $5. How much more money does Mary have than Marco?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much money Marco gives to Mary. Since Marco has $24, half of that would be $12. So, Marco gives $12 to Mary. After receiving $12 from Marco, Mary will have $15 + $12 = $27. However, Mary spends $5, so we need to subtract that from her total. $27 - $5 = $22. Therefore, Mary has $22 more than Marco. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: John chops down 30 trees.  From each tree, he can make 25 planks.  A table takes 15 planks to make and sells for $300.  He paid $3000 for all the labor.  How much profit did he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many planks John can make in total. 30 trees x 25 planks per tree = 750 planks Next, we need to figure out how many tables John can make with those planks. 750 planks / 15 planks per table = 50 tables Now we can calculate John's revenue from selling those tables. 50 tables x $300 per table = $15,000 Finally, we need to subtract the cost of labor to find John's profit. $15,000 - $3,000 = $12,000 Therefore, John made a profit of $12,000. The answer is 12000.\n\n\nQ: Junior has 16 rabbits. On Monday, he bought 6 toys for his rabbits. On Wednesday, he bought twice as many toys as he did Monday. On Friday, he bought four times as many toys as he did on Monday, and on the next day he bought half as many toys as he did on Wednesday. If he split all the toys evenly between the rabbits, how many toys would each rabbit have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many toys Junior bought on Wednesday and Friday. On Wednesday, he bought twice as many toys as he did on Monday, so he bought 6 x 2 = 12 toys. On Friday, he bought four times as many toys as he did on Monday, so he bought 6 x 4 = 24 toys. Next, we need to find out how many toys he bought on Saturday. On Saturday, he bought half as many toys as he did on Wednesday, so he bought 12 / 2 = 6 toys. Now, we can add up all the toys he bought: 6 + 12 + 24 + 6 = 48 toys Junior has 16 rabbits, so if he splits the toys evenly between them, each rabbit will have: 48 toys / 16 rabbits = 3 toys per rabbit. Therefore, each rabbit will have 3 toys. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: John is performing in 3 plays.  Each play has 5 Acts.  He wears 2 wigs per act.  Each wig cost $5.  He drops one of the plays and sells all of the wigs for that play for $4.  How much money did he spend?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many wigs John needs in total. Since he performs in 3 plays and each play has 5 acts, he needs 3 x 5 = 15 wigs in total. Next, we need to find out how much he spent on all the wigs. Since he wears 2 wigs per act, he needs 2 x 15 = 30 wigs in total. Each wig costs $5, so he spent 30 x $5 = $150 on all the wigs. Now, we need to find out how much money he made by selling the wigs from one of the plays. He sold all the wigs for $4 each, so he made 15 x $4 = $60. Finally, we need to subtract the money he made from the money he spent to find out how much money he spent in total. $150 - $60 = $90. Therefore, John spent $90 on all the wigs. The answer is 90.\n\n\n"
