  "test_question": "Q: May is getting her hair cut and colored. It costs $40 for the color and $30 per inch of haircut. If her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8, how much did her cut and color cost?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A hairstylist charges $5 for a normal haircut, $6 for a special haircut, and $8 for a trendy haircut. If he cuts 5 normal haircuts, 3 special haircuts, and 2 trendy haircuts per day, how much money does he earn per week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much money the hairstylist earns per day for each type of haircut: - Normal haircut: $5 x 5 = $25 - Special haircut: $6 x 3 = $18 - Trendy haircut: $8 x 2 = $16 So, the hairstylist earns $25 + $18 + $16 = $59 per day. To calculate how much money he earns per week, we need to multiply this amount by the number of days he works in a week. Let's assume he works 6 days a week: - Weekly earnings: $59 x 6 = $354 Therefore, the hairstylist earns $354 per week. The answer is 354.\n\n\nQ: Keesha wants to get her hair and nails done for prom.  Hair updos cost $50 and manicures cost $30.  How much will these two services cost her with a 20% tip for each beautician?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the hair updo and the manicure without the tip. Hair updo = $50 Manicure = $30 Next, we need to calculate the tip for each service. Tip for hair updo = 20% of $50 = $10 Tip for manicure = 20% of $30 = $6 Now, we can add up the cost of the services and the tips. Total cost = Hair updo + Manicure + Tip for hair updo + Tip for manicure Total cost = $50 + $30 + $10 + $6 Total cost = $96 Therefore, Keesha will need to pay $96 for her hair and nails with a 20% tip for each beautician. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Maria wants to paint a picture and needs some tools to do that. She wants to buy a set of brushes for $20 and some canvas for three times more than the brushes. The paint costs Maria $8 per liter, and she needs at least 5 liters. How much money will she earn on the painting if she will be able to sell it for $200?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much Maria will spend on canvas. We know that the canvas will cost three times more than the brushes, which are $20. So, 3 x $20 = $60 for the canvas. Next, let's calculate how much Maria will spend on paint. She needs at least 5 liters, and each liter costs $8. So, 5 x $8 = $40 for the paint. Now, let's add up all of Maria's expenses: $20 for brushes + $60 for canvas + $40 for paint = $120 total expenses. If Maria sells the painting for $200, she will earn $200 - $120 = $80 profit. The answer is 80.\n\n\nQ: A movie ticket for an adult costs $8, and a child's ticket costs $3. One adult is taking a group of children to the movies. She has $35. How many children can she take with her to the movies?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much money the adult will spend on their own ticket. Since an adult ticket costs $8, we can subtract $8 from the total amount of money the adult has, which is $35. $35 - $8 = $27 Now we know that the adult has $27 left to spend on children's tickets. We also know that each child's ticket costs $3. To figure out how many children the adult can take with her, we need to divide the amount of money she has left by the cost of each child's ticket. $27 \u00f7 $3 = 9 So the adult can take 9 children with her to the movies. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Maddie bought 2 packs of white T-shirts and 4 packs of blue T-shirts for her basketball team. The white T-shirts come in packs of 5, and the blue T-shirts come in packs of 3. Each T-shirt cost $3. How much did Maddie spend in all?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many white T-shirts Maddie bought. She bought 2 packs of white T-shirts, and each pack contains 5 T-shirts. So, she bought a total of 2 x 5 = 10 white T-shirts. Next, we need to find out how many blue T-shirts Maddie bought. She bought 4 packs of blue T-shirts, and each pack contains 3 T-shirts. So, she bought a total of 4 x 3 = 12 blue T-shirts. Now, we can find out how much Maddie spent on white T-shirts. She bought 10 white T-shirts, and each T-shirt cost $3. So, she spent 10 x $3 = $30 on white T-shirts. Similarly, we can find out how much Maddie spent on blue T-shirts. She bought 12 blue T-shirts, and each T-shirt cost $3. So, she spent 12 x $3 = $36 on blue T-shirts. Finally, we can add the amount Maddie spent on white T-shirts and blue T-shirts to find out how much she spent in all. Maddie spent $30 on white T-shirts and $36 on blue T-shirts, so she spent a total of $30 + $36 = $66 in all. The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: Yanna bought ten shirts at $5 each and three pairs of sandals at $3 each.  How much change did she get back if she gave a one hundred dollar bill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of the shirts. 10 shirts x $5 per shirt = $50 Next, let's calculate the total cost of the sandals. 3 pairs of sandals x $3 per pair = $9 Now, let's add the cost of the shirts and sandals together to find the total cost. $50 + $9 = $59 Yanna gave a $100 bill, so we need to subtract the total cost from $100 to find the change. $100 - $59 = $41 Therefore, Yanna received $41 in change. The answer is 41.\n\n\nQ: Maria's monthly salary is $2000. 20% of her salary goes to paying tax, and 5% goes to insurance. Also, a quarter of the money left after the deductions is spent on utility bills. How much money does Maria have after the deductions and utility bills payment?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money goes to tax and insurance. Tax: 20% of $2000 = 0.2 x $2000 = $400 Insurance: 5% of $2000 = 0.05 x $2000 = $100 Next, we need to subtract the total amount of tax and insurance from Maria's monthly salary to find out how much money she has left. $2000 - $400 - $100 = $1500 Now, we need to find out how much money Maria spends on utility bills. A quarter of $1500 = 0.25 x $1500 = $375 Finally, we need to subtract the amount spent on utility bills from the money Maria has left after the deductions. $1500 - $375 = $1125 Therefore, Maria has $1125 left after the deductions and utility bills payment. The answer is 1125.\n\n\nQ: There are four lamps in Valerie's room. All of them are burnt out, so she needs to buy new light bulbs. She needs 3 small light bulbs and 1 large light bulb. She has $60 to spend. If small light bulbs cost $8 and large light bulbs cost $12, how much money will Valerie have left over?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total cost of the light bulbs Valerie needs to buy. The cost of 3 small light bulbs is: 3 x $8 = $24 The cost of 1 large light bulb is: 1 x $12 = $12 So the total cost is: $24 + $12 = $36 Next, we need to subtract the total cost from the amount of money Valerie has: $60 - $36 = $24 Therefore, Valerie will have $24 left over after buying the light bulbs. The answer is 24.\n\n\n"
