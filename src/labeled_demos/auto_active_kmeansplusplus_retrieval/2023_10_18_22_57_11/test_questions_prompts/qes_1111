  "test_question": "Q: On average Joe throws 25 punches per minute.  A fight lasts 5 rounds of 3 minutes.  How many punches did he throw?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: John can play 200 beats per minute.  If he plays 2 hours a day for 3 days how many beats does he play?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many minutes John plays in total. Since he plays for 2 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, he plays for 2 x 60 = 120 minutes per day. Therefore, over 3 days, he plays for a total of 120 x 3 = 360 minutes. Now we need to find out how many beats he plays in total. If he plays 200 beats per minute, then in 360 minutes he plays 200 x 360 = 72,000 beats. So John plays 72,000 beats over the course of 3 days. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Jan enters a double dutch competition.  After training she doubles her speed which used to be 70 skips per minute.  How many skips does she do in 5 minutes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out Jan's new speed after doubling it. 70 skips per minute x 2 = 140 skips per minute Now that we know Jan's new speed, we can find out how many skips she does in 5 minutes. 140 skips per minute x 5 minutes = 700 skips Therefore, Jan does 700 skips in 5 minutes after doubling her speed. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: John takes a pill every 6 hours.  How many pills does he take a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 24 hours in a day, so John takes 24/6 = 4 pills per day. In a week, there are 7 days, so John takes 4 x 7 = 28 pills per week. The answer is 28.\n\n\nQ: Carlos and Diego are racing around the block. Carlos runs around the entire block in 3 minutes. Diego runs around half the block in 2.5 minutes and then is tripped by a dog and can't finish. Assuming he kept up the same speed the entire race, what would've been the average time in seconds for the racers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Diego to run the entire block. Since he runs half the block in 2.5 minutes, we can use proportion to find out: 2.5 minutes = 1/2 block x minutes = 1 block Cross-multiplying, we get: 2.5 * 2 = x * 1 5 = x So it would take Diego 5 minutes to run the entire block if he hadn't been tripped. Now we can find the average time for the racers. We add up the time it took Carlos and the time it would've taken Diego, and divide by the number of racers: (3 minutes + 5 minutes) / 2 racers = 4 minutes But the question asks for the answer in seconds, so we need to convert minutes to seconds: 4 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 240 seconds So the average time for the racers would've been 240 seconds. The answer is 240.\n\n\nQ: Joe played catch with Derek and Tammy. He caught the ball 23 times. Derek made four less than double the catches Joe did. Tammy caught the ball sixteen more than a third of the times Derek did. How many times did Tammy catch the ball?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Joe caught the ball 23 times. Next, we need to figure out how many times Derek caught the ball. We know that he made four less than double the catches Joe did. So, we can set up an equation: Derek's catches = 2(Joe's catches) - 4 Derek's catches = 2(23) - 4 Derek's catches = 42 Now we need to figure out how many times Tammy caught the ball. We know that she caught the ball sixteen more than a third of the times Derek did. So, we can set up an equation: Tammy's catches = (1/3)(Derek's catches) + 16 Tammy's catches = (1/3)(42) + 16 Tammy's catches = 14 + 16 Tammy's catches = 30 Therefore, Tammy caught the ball 30 times. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: Don can paint 3 tiles a minute, Ken can paint 2 more tiles a minute than Don and Laura can paint twice as many tiles as Ken. Kim can paint 3 fewer tiles than Laura can in a minute. How many tiles can Don, Ken, Laura and Kim paint in 15 minutes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many tiles each person can paint in one minute. Don can paint 3 tiles a minute. Ken can paint 2 more tiles a minute than Don, so Ken can paint 3 + 2 = 5 tiles a minute. Laura can paint twice as many tiles as Ken, so Laura can paint 5 x 2 = 10 tiles a minute. Kim can paint 3 fewer tiles than Laura can in a minute, so Kim can paint 10 - 3 = 7 tiles a minute. Now that we know how many tiles each person can paint in one minute, we can multiply that by 15 to find out how many tiles they can paint in 15 minutes. Don can paint 3 x 15 = 45 tiles in 15 minutes. Ken can paint 5 x 15 = 75 tiles in 15 minutes. Laura can paint 10 x 15 = 150 tiles in 15 minutes. Kim can paint 7 x 15 = 105 tiles in 15 minutes. Therefore, Don can paint 45 tiles, Ken can paint 75 tiles, Laura can paint 150 tiles, and Kim can paint 105 tiles in 15 minutes. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Jenny wants to read 3 books in the next 10 days. She can read 100 words per hour. If the first book has 200 words, the second book has 400 words, and the third book has 300 words, how many minutes per day, on average, should she spend reading?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find the total number of words in all three books: 200 + 400 + 300 = 900 words Next, let's find the total number of hours it will take Jenny to read all three books: 900 words \u00f7 100 words per hour = 9 hours Now, let's find the average number of minutes per day that Jenny should spend reading: 9 hours \u00f7 10 days = 0.9 hours per day 0.9 hours per day x 60 minutes per hour = 54 minutes per day Therefore, Jenny should spend an average of 54 minutes per day reading to finish all three books in 10 days. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Larry jogs for 30 minutes each day. In the first week, he jogs for 3 days while he jogs for 5 days in the second week. How many hours does he jog in total for two weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days Larry jogs in two weeks. Larry jogs for 3 days in the first week and 5 days in the second week, so he jogs for a total of 3 + 5 = 8 days in two weeks. Next, we need to find out how many hours Larry jogs in one day. Larry jogs for 30 minutes each day, which is equivalent to 0.5 hours. Finally, we can calculate how many hours Larry jogs in total for two weeks by multiplying the number of days by the number of hours per day: 8 days x 0.5 hours per day = 4 hours Therefore, Larry jogs for a total of 4 hours in two weeks. The answer is 4.\n\n\n"
