  "formatted_prompt": "Q: There are 10 bags with 30 oranges each on a truck. A total of 50 pieces of oranges are rotten. Thirty pieces of oranges will be kept for making orange juice and the rest will be sold. How many pieces of oranges will be sold?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of oranges in the 10 bags. 10 bags x 30 oranges/bag = 300 oranges Next, we need to subtract the number of rotten oranges. 300 oranges - 50 rotten oranges = 250 good oranges Now, we know that 30 oranges will be kept for making juice. 250 good oranges - 30 oranges for juice = 220 oranges to be sold Therefore, 220 pieces of oranges will be sold. The answer is 220.\n\n\nQ: Harris feeds his dog 1 large organic carrot over the course of 1 day.  There are 5 carrots in a 1 pound bag and each bag costs $2.00.  In one year, how much will Harris spend on carrots?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many pounds of carrots Harris will need in a year. Since he feeds his dog 1 carrot per day, he will need 365 carrots in a year. Next, we need to figure out how many bags of carrots he will need. If there are 5 carrots in a bag, then he will need 365/5 = 73 bags of carrots in a year. Finally, we can calculate the cost of the carrots. Each bag costs $2.00, so 73 bags will cost 73 x $2.00 = $146.00. Therefore, Harris will spend $146.00 on carrots in one year. The answer is 146.\n\n\nQ: Ella has 4 bags with 20 apples in each bag and six bags with 25 apples in each bag. If Ella sells 200 apples, how many apples does Ella has left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many apples Ella has in total. She has 4 bags with 20 apples in each bag, so that's 4 x 20 = 80 apples. She also has 6 bags with 25 apples in each bag, so that's 6 x 25 = 150 apples. In total, Ella has 80 + 150 = 230 apples. If she sells 200 apples, we can subtract that from the total: 230 - 200 = 30 Therefore, Ella has 30 apples left. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: Colby harvested his mango trees, the total mangoes he harvested is 60 kilograms. He sold 20 kilograms to the market and sold the remaining half to his community. If each kilogram contains 8 mangoes, how many mangoes does he still have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many kilograms of mangoes Colby sold to his community. We know that he sold 20 kilograms to the market, so he had 60 - 20 = 40 kilograms left. Next, we need to find out how many kilograms of mangoes he sold to his community. We know that he sold half of the remaining 40 kilograms, which is 40/2 = 20 kilograms. Finally, we need to find out how many mangoes he still has. We know that each kilogram contains 8 mangoes, so he sold a total of 20 + 20 = 40 kilograms, which is equivalent to 40 x 8 = 320 mangoes. Therefore, Colby still has 60 - 40 = 20 kilograms of mangoes, which is equivalent to 20 x 8 = 160 mangoes. The answer is 160.\n\n\nQ: A bakery sells boxes of doughnuts and if there are any doughnuts left at the end of the day, the bakery gives them away. Each box of doughnuts holds 10 doughnuts and all of the doughnuts that the bakery makes are put into these boxes. The bakery makes 300 doughnuts for the day and sells 27 boxes of doughnuts throughout the day. How many doughnuts are given away at the end of the day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many doughnuts were sold during the day. We know that each box contains 10 doughnuts, so 27 boxes would contain 27 x 10 = 270 doughnuts. Next, we can subtract the number of doughnuts sold from the total number of doughnuts made to find out how many were left over. 300 - 270 = 30 Therefore, there are 30 doughnuts left at the end of the day that will be given away. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: A cake of 400 grams is divided into eight equal parts. Nathalie eats one-eighth of the cake, and Pierre eats double what Nathalie ate. How much did Pierre eat, in grams?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much one-eighth of the cake weighs. We can do this by dividing the weight of the cake (400 grams) by 8: 400 \u00f7 8 = 50 So one-eighth of the cake weighs 50 grams. Next, we need to find out how much Pierre ate, which is double what Nathalie ate. We can do this by multiplying Nathalie's portion (50 grams) by 2: 50 \u00d7 2 = 100 Therefore, Pierre ate 100 grams of the cake. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of 18 watermelons. Since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, the total weight of 18 watermelons would be: 23 x 18 = 414 pounds Next, we need to find the total amount of money Farmer Kent would make by selling these watermelons. Since he sells them for $2 a pound, we can multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 414 x $2 = $828 Therefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Paul has five dogs. For every 10 pounds they weigh, they need 1 pound of dog food per day. One weighs 20 pounds. One weighs 40. Another weighs 10. One weighs 30 and the final one weighs 50 pounds. How much dog food does he need each day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total weight of all five dogs. Total weight = 20 + 40 + 10 + 30 + 50 = 150 pounds Next, we need to calculate how much dog food is needed per day for every 10 pounds of weight. 1 pound of dog food is needed for every 10 pounds of weight So, for 150 pounds of weight, we need: 150/10 = 15 pounds of dog food per day Therefore, Paul needs 15 pounds of dog food each day to feed his five dogs. The answer is 15.\n\n\n"
