  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Gwen received a $900 bonus at work and decided to invest this money in the stock market.  She spent one-third of her bonus on stock A, one-third on stock B, and the remaining one-third on stock C.   After one year, stock A and stock B had doubled in value, while stock C had lost half of its value.  At the end of the year, how much were Gwen's stocks worth, in dollars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Gwen spent on each stock. Since she spent one-third of her bonus on each stock, we can calculate: - Stock A: 1/3 x $900 = $300 - Stock B: 1/3 x $900 = $300 - Stock C: 1/3 x $900 = $300 Next, we need to calculate the value of each stock after one year: - Stock A: $300 x 2 = $600 - Stock B: $300 x 2 = $600 - Stock C: $300 / 2 = $150 Finally, we can add up the value of all three stocks to find out how much Gwen's stocks are worth after one year: - Total value = $600 + $600 + $150 = $1,350 Therefore, Gwen's stocks are worth $1,350 after one year. The answer is 1350.\n\n\nQ: Mrs. Thomson received an incentive worth $240. She spent 1/3 of the money on food and 1/5 of it on clothes. Then, she put in her savings account 3/4 of the remaining money. How much money did Mrs. Thomson save?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Mrs. Thomson spent on food. We know that she spent 1/3 of the $240 incentive on food, so we can calculate: 1/3 x $240 = $80 Next, we need to find out how much money she spent on clothes. We know that she spent 1/5 of the $240 incentive on clothes, so we can calculate: 1/5 x $240 = $48 To find out how much money she had left after spending on food and clothes, we need to subtract the amounts she spent from the total incentive: $240 - $80 - $48 = $112 Now we know that Mrs. Thomson had $112 left. She put 3/4 of this amount into her savings account, so we can calculate: 3/4 x $112 = $84 Therefore, Mrs. Thomson saved $84. The answer is 84.\n\n\nQ: Sarah wants to start a cupcake business and was approved for a business loan.  The loan has 0% interest if she pays the entire amount back in 5 years, which she decides to do.  If she put $10,000 down as a down payment and her monthly payments are $600.00, how much was her loan for (including the down payment)?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total number of months in 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 5 years would be 5 x 12 = 60 months. Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money Sarah will pay in monthly payments. She will pay $600 per month for 60 months, so the total amount of money she will pay is 600 x 60 = $36,000. Now, we can calculate the total cost of the loan, including the down payment. Sarah put $10,000 down, and she will pay $36,000 in monthly payments, so the total cost of the loan is $10,000 + $36,000 = $46,000. Therefore, Sarah's loan was for $46,000 (including the down payment). The answer is 46000.\n\n\nQ: Yoque borrowed money from her sister. She promised to pay it back in 11 months including an additional 10% of the money she borrowed. If she pays $15 per month, how much money did she borrow?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Yoque borrowed some amount of money from her sister. Let's call this amount \"x\". Next, we know that Yoque promised to pay back the money in 11 months, and that this includes an additional 10% of the money she borrowed. This means that Yoque will pay back the original amount she borrowed (x) plus 10% of that amount (0.1x). So the total amount Yoque will pay back is: x + 0.1x = 1.1x Finally, we know that Yoque will pay back this total amount over 11 months, at a rate of $15 per month. So we can set up an equation: 1.1x / 11 = 15 To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 11: 1.1x = 165 And then divide both sides by 1.1: x = 150 So Yoque borrowed $150 from her sister. The answer is 150.\n\n\nQ: Danielle bought a new house for $280k. She paid a $40k deposit on the house, and pays the rest using a mortgage that is spread out over 10 years. Danielle makes equal payments every month and at the end of the 10 years, the entire balance will be paid off. How much, in thousands of dollars, does Danielle pay each month?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much Danielle still owes on the house after paying the $40k deposit. $280k - $40k = $240k Next, we need to figure out how many months there are in 10 years. 10 years x 12 months/year = 120 months Finally, we can divide the remaining balance by the number of months to find out how much Danielle pays each month. $240k \u00f7 120 months = $2000/month Therefore, Danielle pays $2000 per month towards her mortgage. The answer is 2000.\n\n\nQ: Gina has two bank accounts. Each account has a quarter of the balance in Betty's account. If Betty's account balance is $3,456, what is the combined balance of both Gina's accounts?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money is in each of Gina's accounts. We know that each account has a quarter of the balance in Betty's account, so we can divide Betty's balance by 4 to get the balance in each of Gina's accounts. $3,456 / 4 = $864 So each of Gina's accounts has $864. To find the combined balance of both of Gina's accounts, we simply add them together. $864 + $864 = $1,728 Therefore, the combined balance of both of Gina's accounts is $1,728. The answer is 1728.\n\n\nQ: Anna spent 1/4 of her money, and now she has $24 left. How much did she have originally?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Anna spent 1/4 of her money. This means that she has 3/4 of her money left. Next, we know that she has $24 left. We can set up an equation to represent this: 3/4x = $24 To solve for x (the original amount of money Anna had), we can isolate x by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3: x = $24 x 4/3 x = $32 Therefore, Anna originally had $32. The answer is 32.\n\n\nQ: Kendy made 2 online bank transactions. She transferred $60 to her mom and half that amount to her sister. As a result, her account now has $100 left in it. How much money was in the account before the transfer?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Kendy transferred $60 to her mom. So, before the transfer, her account had $60 + $100 = $160. Next, we know that Kendy transferred half of $60, which is $30, to her sister. So, before the second transfer, her account had $160 + $30 = $190. Finally, we know that after the second transfer, Kendy had $100 left in her account. So, before the second transfer, her account had $100 + $30 = $130. Therefore, the amount of money in Kendy's account before the transfers was $130. The answer is 130.\n\n\n"
