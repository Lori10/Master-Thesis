  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Two old ladies spent the afternoon walking through Central Park.  The first lady walked twice as far as the second lady.  If the second lady walked four miles, what is the combined total distance, in miles, the two ladies walked?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the second lady walked 4 miles. Next, we know that the first lady walked twice as far as the second lady. So, we can multiply the second lady's distance by 2 to find the first lady's distance: 4 miles x 2 = 8 miles Therefore, the combined total distance the two ladies walked is: 4 miles + 8 miles = 12 miles The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: Billy and Tiffany are having a contest to see how can run the most miles in a week. On Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, Billy runs 1 mile each day and Tiffany runs 2 miles each day. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, Billy runs 1 mile each day and Tiffany runs a 1/3 of a mile each day. On Saturday Tiffany assumes she's going to win and takes the day off. How many miles does Billy have to run on Saturday to tie Tiffany?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how many miles Billy and Tiffany run from Sunday to Friday: Billy: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 miles Tiffany: 2 + 2 + 2 + 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 6 2/3 miles So, by Friday, Tiffany is ahead by 2/3 of a mile. To tie Tiffany, Billy needs to run 2/3 of a mile on Saturday. Therefore, Billy needs to run 0.67 miles on Saturday to tie Tiffany. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Talia is playing football with her friends. The park they're playing at is 5 miles from Talia's house. After their game, Talia is planning to go to the grocery store 3 miles away from the park and 8 miles from her home. Starting and ending at Talia's house, how many miles does Talia drive that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Talia drives 5 miles from her house to the park. Then, she drives 3 miles from the park to the grocery store. Finally, she drives 8 miles from the grocery store back to her house. To find the total distance Talia drives that day, we can add up these three distances: 5 miles + 3 miles + 8 miles = 16 miles Therefore, Talia drives a total of 16 miles that day. The answer is 16.\n\n\nQ: Ann can skate 6 miles an hour. Her friend Glenda can skate 8 miles an hour. If they start in the same place and skate in straight lines in opposite directions for 3 hours, how many miles apart do they end up?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how far Ann and Glenda each skate in 3 hours. Ann: 6 miles/hour x 3 hours = 18 miles Glenda: 8 miles/hour x 3 hours = 24 miles Step 2: Add the distances they each skated to find the total distance between them. 18 miles + 24 miles = 42 miles Therefore, Ann and Glenda end up 42 miles apart after skating in opposite directions for 3 hours. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Malik rushed for 18 yards in each of 4 games. Josiah ran for 22 yards in each of 4 games. Darnell had an average of 11 yards rushed for each of the 4 games. How many yards did the 3 athletes run in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. Malik rushed for 18 yards in each of 4 games, so he ran a total of 18 x 4 = 72 yards. Josiah ran for 22 yards in each of 4 games, so he ran a total of 22 x 4 = 88 yards. Darnell had an average of 11 yards rushed for each of the 4 games, so he ran a total of 11 x 4 = 44 yards. To find the total yards run by the three athletes, we add up their individual totals: 72 + 88 + 44 = 204 yards. Therefore, the three athletes ran a total of 204 yards. The answer is 204.\n\n\nQ: Colin ran his first mile in 6 minutes.  He ran his next two miles in 5 minutes each and finished his 4th mile in 4 minutes.  What was the average time it took him to run a mile?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total time it took Colin to run all four miles. - Colin's first mile took 6 minutes. - His next two miles took 5 minutes each, so that's a total of 10 minutes. - His fourth mile took 4 minutes. To find the total time, we add these up: 6 + 10 + 4 = 20 So Colin ran four miles in a total of 20 minutes. To find the average time it took him to run a mile, we divide the total time by the number of miles: 20 / 4 = 5 So Colin's average time to run a mile was 5 minutes. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Richard starts walking from Cincinnati to New York City, which is 70 miles. Richards walks 20 miles the first day. The next day he walks 6 miles less than half as much as he walked the first day. He walks 10 miles the third day. How many miles further does Richard have to walk to be in New York City?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Richard walks 20 miles. On the second day, he walks 6 miles less than half as much as he walked the first day. Half of what he walked on the first day is 20/2 = 10 miles. So, he walks 10 - 6 = 4 miles on the second day. On the third day, he walks 10 miles. Therefore, the total distance Richard has walked so far is 20 + 4 + 10 = 34 miles. To reach New York City, which is 70 miles away, Richard still has to walk 70 - 34 = 36 miles further. The answer is 36.\n\n\nQ: Silvio was running a race that had 4 parts. The total length of the race was 74.5 kilometers. The first part of the race is 15.5 kilometers long. The second and third parts are each 21.5 kilometers long. How many kilometers is the last part of the race?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to add up the lengths of the first three parts of the race: 15.5 km + 21.5 km + 21.5 km = 58.5 km We know that the total length of the race is 74.5 km, so we can subtract the sum of the first three parts from the total length to find the length of the last part: 74.5 km - 58.5 km = 16 km Therefore, the last part of the race is 16 kilometers long. The answer is 16.\n\n\n"
