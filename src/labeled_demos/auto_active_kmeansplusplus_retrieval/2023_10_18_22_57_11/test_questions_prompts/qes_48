  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Lucas wants to get a dog but his parents think he already has too many pets and won't have enough space. He already has 12 pet beds in his room but manages to fit another 8 pet beds. His parents argue that each pet is going to need 2 beds each to feel comfortable. According to his parent's argument, how many pets does Lucas have enough room for?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pet beds Lucas has in total after adding the 8 new ones. 12 + 8 = 20 pet beds Next, we need to divide the total number of pet beds by 2 to find out how many pets can be accommodated. 20 \u00f7 2 = 10 pets Therefore, according to his parent's argument, Lucas has enough room for 10 pets. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: June made a design with 20 equal tiles. Three tiles are yellow and the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles. Six tiles are purple and the remaining tiles are white.  How many white tiles are there?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 3 yellow tiles. Next, we know that the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles, so there are 3+1=4 blue tiles. Then, we know that there are 6 purple tiles. So far, we have accounted for 3+4+6=13 tiles. Since there are 20 tiles in total, we can subtract 13 from 20 to find the number of white tiles: 20-13=7 Therefore, there are 7 white tiles in June's design. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Marla has a grid of squares that has 10 rows and 15 squares in each row. She colors 4 rows of 6 squares in the middle of the grid with red. She colors all squares on the first 2 and last 2 rows with blue. Then she colors the rest with green. How many squares does Marla color green?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of squares in the grid. We can do this by multiplying the number of rows by the number of squares in each row: 10 rows x 15 squares/row = 150 squares Next, we need to find the number of squares that Marla colors red. She colors 4 rows of 6 squares each, so: 4 rows x 6 squares/row = 24 squares Now we need to find the number of squares that Marla colors blue. She colors the first 2 and last 2 rows, which means she colors a total of: 2 rows x 15 squares/row + 2 rows x 15 squares/row = 60 squares Finally, we can subtract the number of red and blue squares from the total number of squares to find the number of green squares: 150 total squares - 24 red squares - 60 blue squares = 66 green squares Therefore, Marla colors 66 squares green. The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: John has 10 members of his family on his father's side.  His mother's side is 30% larger.  How many people are there in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to find out how many people are on John's mother's side. We know that it is 30% larger than his father's side, so we can calculate: 30% of 10 = 0.3 x 10 = 3 This means that John has 3 more family members on his mother's side than on his father's side. So, the total number of family members on his mother's side is: 10 + 3 = 13 Now, we can add up the number of family members on both sides to find the total: 10 + 13 = 23 Therefore, there are 23 people in John's family in total. The answer is 23.\n\n\nQ: Jim has 2 rows of 4 trees to start.  When he turns 10 he decides to plant a new row of trees every year on his birthday.  On his 15th birthday after he doubles the number of trees he has.  How many trees does he have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller steps. Step 1: Jim starts with 2 rows of 4 trees each, so he has a total of 2 x 4 = 8 trees. Step 2: Jim plants a new row of trees every year on his birthday, starting from his 10th birthday. So, he plants trees for 15 - 10 = 5 years. Step 3: In these 5 years, Jim plants 5 new rows of trees, one row each year. Step 4: Therefore, Jim now has a total of 2 + 5 = 7 rows of trees. Step 5: Each row has 4 trees, so Jim has a total of 7 x 4 = 28 trees. Step 6: On his 15th birthday, Jim doubles the number of trees he has. So, he now has 28 x 2 = 56 trees. Therefore, Jim has 56 trees after he doubles the number of trees he has on his 15th birthday. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Betsy is sewing a quilt.  The quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side.  Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together.  How many more squares does she need to sew together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many squares Betsy has already sewn together. If the quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side, then the total number of squares in the quilt is: 16 x 16 = 256 squares If Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together, then she has sewn: 0.25 x 256 = 64 squares Now we need to find out how many more squares she needs to sew together. To do this, we can subtract the number of squares she has already sewn from the total number of squares in the quilt: 256 - 64 = 192 squares So Betsy still needs to sew together 192 squares to complete the quilt. The answer is 192.\n\n\nQ: James and 4 of his friends volunteered to plant flowers. In 2 days, they were able to plant a total of 200 flowers. If each of them planted the same number of flowers, how many flowers did James plant in a day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people were planting flowers. We know that James and 4 of his friends volunteered, so there were 5 people in total. Next, we need to find out how many flowers each person planted in 2 days. To do this, we can divide the total number of flowers planted (200) by the number of people (5) and the number of days (2): 200 \u00f7 5 \u00f7 2 = 20 So each person planted 20 flowers in 2 days. Finally, we need to find out how many flowers James planted in 1 day. Since each person planted 20 flowers in 2 days, we can divide that by 2 to find out how many flowers each person planted in 1 day: 20 \u00f7 2 = 10 Therefore, James planted 10 flowers in 1 day. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Eric has 20 marbles. He has 12 white marbles, 6 blue marbles, and the rest are green marbles. How many green marbles does Eric have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Eric has a total of 20 marbles. Out of those 20 marbles, he has 12 white marbles and 6 blue marbles. To find out how many green marbles he has, we need to subtract the number of white and blue marbles from the total number of marbles: 20 - 12 - 6 = 2 Therefore, Eric has 2 green marbles. The answer is 2.\n\n\n"
