  "formatted_prompt": "Q: There are 50 oysters on the rocks at La Push Park and 72 crabs by the beach. Eric, who loves walking by the beach, makes a note of this and goes home. The next day, he realizes only half the number of Oysters were on the rocks, and only 2/3 the number of crabs as the previous day are on the beach. How many oysters and crabs did he count in total in the two days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Eric counted 50 oysters and 72 crabs, so the total number of oysters and crabs he counted on the first day is: 50 + 72 = 122 On the second day, Eric realized only half the number of oysters were on the rocks, which means there were: 50 / 2 = 25 oysters on the rocks on the second day And only 2/3 the number of crabs as the previous day were on the beach, which means there were: 72 x 2/3 = 48 crabs on the beach on the second day So the total number of oysters and crabs Eric counted on the second day is: 25 + 48 = 73 Therefore, the total number of oysters and crabs Eric counted in total in the two days is: 122 + 73 = 195 The answer is 195.\n\n\nQ: Nori had 4 boxes of crayons with 8 crayons in each box. She gave 5 crayons to Mae and also give some crayons to Lea. How many more crayons did she give to Lea than Mae if she has only 15 crayons left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many crayons Nori had in total. 4 boxes x 8 crayons per box = 32 crayons Next, we need to subtract the 5 crayons Nori gave to Mae. 32 crayons - 5 crayons = 27 crayons We know that Nori has 15 crayons left, so we can subtract that from the 27 crayons to find out how many crayons she gave to Lea. 27 crayons - 15 crayons = 12 crayons Therefore, Nori gave 12 crayons to Lea. To find out how many more crayons Nori gave to Lea than Mae, we can subtract the 5 crayons from Mae from the 12 crayons given to Lea. 12 crayons - 5 crayons = 7 crayons So Nori gave 7 more crayons to Lea than Mae. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: A zoo has 8 parrots. It 3 times the number of snakes than parrots and 2 times the number of monkeys than snakes. The number of elephants is half the number of parrots and snakes added up, and there are 3 fewer zebras than elephants. What is the difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the zoo has 8 parrots. Next, we are told that there are 3 times as many snakes as parrots. So, the number of snakes would be 3 x 8 = 24. Then, we are told that there are 2 times as many monkeys as snakes. So, the number of monkeys would be 2 x 24 = 48. The number of elephants is half the number of parrots and snakes added up. So, the number of elephants would be (8 + 24) / 2 = 16. Finally, we are told that there are 3 fewer zebras than elephants. So, the number of zebras would be 16 - 3 = 13. The difference between the number of zebras and monkeys would be 48 - 13 = 35. Therefore, the difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys is 35. The answer is 35.\n\n\nQ: Last night Kannon had 3 apples, a banana, and 4 oranges for dinner. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, and twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today. How many fruits would she have eaten so far in the two meals?\nA: Let's think step by step. Last night Kannon had 3 apples, 1 banana, and 4 oranges, so she had a total of 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 fruits. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, which means she will have 3 + 4 = 7 apples today. She is also planning to have 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, which means she will have 1 x 10 = 10 bananas today. Finally, she is planning to have twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today, which means she will have 7 x 2 = 14 oranges today. Therefore, in total, Kannon will have eaten 7 + 10 + 14 = 31 fruits in the two meals. The answer is 31.\n\n\nQ: Marion received 20 more turtles than Martha at the animal rescue center where they had gone to take part in the animal saving day event. If Martha received 40 turtles, how many turtles did they receive together?\nA: Let's think step by step. Martha received 40 turtles. Marion received 20 more turtles than Martha, which means Marion received 40 + 20 = 60 turtles. To find out how many turtles they received together, we need to add Martha's turtles to Marion's turtles: 40 + 60 = 100. Therefore, they received 100 turtles together. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Ivan has 20 dice. Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. How many dice do they have altogether?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Ivan has 20 dice. Next, we know that Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. So, we can multiply Ivan's number of dice by 2 to find Jerry's number of dice: 20 x 2 = 40 Therefore, Jerry has 40 dice. To find the total number of dice they have altogether, we can add Ivan's and Jerry's number of dice: 20 + 40 = 60 Therefore, they have 60 dice altogether. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. If Mabel has 85 marbles, how many more marbles does Mabel have than Amanda?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Katrina has. We know that Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 85 marbles, so we can set up an equation: Mabel's marbles = 5 x Katrina's marbles 85 = 5 x Katrina's marbles Katrina's marbles = 17 Now we know that Katrina has 17 marbles. We also know that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. So we can set up another equation: Amanda's marbles = 2 x Katrina's marbles + 12 Amanda's marbles = 2 x 17 + 12 Amanda's marbles = 46 So Amanda has 46 marbles. Finally, we can figure out how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda: Mabel's marbles - Amanda's marbles = 85 - 46 Mabel's marbles - Amanda's marbles = 39 Therefore, Mabel has 39 more marbles than Amanda. The answer is 39.\n\n\nQ: Tania has five baskets containing a total of 58 fruits. There are 18 mangoes in one basket, 10 pears in another, 12 pawpaws in another and the last 2 contain the same number of kiwi and lemon respectively, how many lemons are there?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of fruits in the three baskets that are not kiwi or lemon. 18 + 10 + 12 = 40 So, there are 40 fruits in those three baskets. Next, we need to find the total number of fruits in all five baskets. If there are 58 fruits in total, and 40 of them are in the three baskets we just added up, then the remaining two baskets must contain: 58 - 40 = 18 fruits We know that one of those baskets contains kiwi and the other contains lemon, and they have the same number of fruits. So, we can divide the remaining 18 fruits by 2 to get: 18 / 2 = 9 Therefore, there are 9 lemons in the basket with lemon. The answer is 9.\n\n\n"
