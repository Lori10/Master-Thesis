  "formatted_prompt": "Q: There are 10 bags with 30 oranges each on a truck. A total of 50 pieces of oranges are rotten. Thirty pieces of oranges will be kept for making orange juice and the rest will be sold. How many pieces of oranges will be sold?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of oranges in the 10 bags. 10 bags x 30 oranges/bag = 300 oranges Next, we need to subtract the number of rotten oranges. 300 oranges - 50 rotten oranges = 250 good oranges Now, we know that 30 oranges will be kept for making juice. 250 good oranges - 30 oranges for juice = 220 oranges to be sold Therefore, 220 pieces of oranges will be sold. The answer is 220.\n\n\nQ: There are 10 cars parked in a mall\u2019s parking lot, each with the same number of customers inside. Each customer only makes 1 purchase. If the sports store makes 20 sales and the music store makes 30 sales, how many customers are in each of the cars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of sales made in the parking lot. We can do this by adding the number of sales made by the sports store and the music store: 20 + 30 = 50 So, there were 50 purchases made in total. Next, we need to find out how many customers were in each car. We know that there are 10 cars, and each car has the same number of customers. Let's call the number of customers in each car \"x\". So, the total number of customers in all the cars is: 10x And we know that this is equal to the total number of purchases made: 10x = 50 To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 10: x = 5 So, there were 5 customers in each car. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Brenda picks 250 peaches. When she sorts through them, only 60% are fresh, and Brenda has to throw 15 away for being too small. How many peaches does Brenda have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many peaches are fresh. We can do this by multiplying the total number of peaches by the percentage that are fresh: 250 x 0.6 = 150 So Brenda has 150 fresh peaches. Next, we need to subtract the 15 peaches that she threw away: 150 - 15 = 135 Therefore, Brenda has 135 peaches left after sorting through them. The answer is 135.\n\n\nQ: Tania has five baskets containing a total of 58 fruits. There are 18 mangoes in one basket, 10 pears in another, 12 pawpaws in another and the last 2 contain the same number of kiwi and lemon respectively, how many lemons are there?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of fruits in the three baskets that are not kiwi or lemon. 18 + 10 + 12 = 40 So, there are 40 fruits in those three baskets. Next, we need to find the total number of fruits in all five baskets. If there are 58 fruits in total, and 40 of them are in the three baskets we just added up, then the remaining two baskets must contain: 58 - 40 = 18 fruits We know that one of those baskets contains kiwi and the other contains lemon, and they have the same number of fruits. So, we can divide the remaining 18 fruits by 2 to get: 18 / 2 = 9 Therefore, there are 9 lemons in the basket with lemon. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Jacque arrived in France and his suitcase weighed 5 pounds.  While in France, he picked up 5 bottles of perfume that weighed 1.2 ounces each, 4 pounds of chocolate, 2 bars of soap that weighed 5 ounces each and 2 jars of jam that weighed 8 ounces each.  Considering 16 ounces is the same as 1 pound, how much did Jacque's suitcase weigh on the return flight home?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the weight of the perfume bottles from ounces to pounds. Since 16 ounces is equal to 1 pound, we can divide 1.2 ounces by 16 to get the weight of one bottle in pounds: 1.2 ounces \u00f7 16 = 0.075 pounds Since Jacque picked up 5 bottles, we can multiply the weight of one bottle by 5 to get the total weight of the perfume: 0.075 pounds/bottle x 5 bottles = 0.375 pounds Next, we need to add the weight of the chocolate, soap, and jam in pounds: 4 pounds (chocolate) + 0.625 pounds (soap and jam) = 4.625 pounds Finally, we can add the weight of the perfume and the other items to the weight of Jacque's suitcase when he arrived in France: 5 pounds (suitcase) + 0.375 pounds (perfume) + 4.625 pounds (chocolate, soap, and jam) = 10 pounds Therefore, Jacque's suitcase weighed 10 pounds on the return flight home. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: Mary wants 144 cupcakes for her party. Mary has already made 36 cherry cupcakes, and 48 berry cupcakes. Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes for the rest. How much of each should she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Mary has already made: 36 cherry + 48 berry = 84 cupcakes Next, we need to figure out how many more cupcakes Mary needs to make: 144 total cupcakes - 84 cupcakes already made = 60 cupcakes Since Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, we can divide the remaining 60 cupcakes by 2: 60 cupcakes \u00f7 2 = 30 cupcakes of each flavor Therefore, Mary should make 30 chocolate cupcakes and 30 vanilla cupcakes to have a total of 144 cupcakes for her party. The answer is 144.\n\n\nQ: Vicente saw Sophie's mom giving Sophie 20 oranges every day to carry to school to eat. He also saw Hannah's dad giving Hannah 40 grapes every day to eat at the school. If he counted the number of fruits that the girls were given for 30 days, calculate the total number of fruits that Sophie and Hannah had eaten in the 30 days.\nA: Let's think step by step. Sophie was given 20 oranges every day for 30 days, so the total number of oranges she received is: 20 oranges/day x 30 days = 600 oranges Similarly, Hannah was given 40 grapes every day for 30 days, so the total number of grapes she received is: 40 grapes/day x 30 days = 1200 grapes Therefore, the total number of fruits that Sophie and Hannah had eaten in the 30 days is: 600 oranges + 1200 grapes = 1800 fruits The answer is 1800.\n\n\n"
