  "test_question": "Q: Sally received the following scores on her math quizzes: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60. Find her mean score.",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Tatuya, Ivanna, and Dorothy took a quiz together. Tatuya scored twice as much as Ivanna, and Ivanna scored 3/5 times as many marks as Dorothy. If Dorothy scored 90 marks, calculate the average marks scored by the three.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many marks Ivanna scored. We know that Ivanna scored 3/5 times as many marks as Dorothy, who scored 90 marks. So Ivanna scored: 3/5 * 90 = 54 marks Next, we need to find out how many marks Tatuya scored. We know that Tatuya scored twice as much as Ivanna, who scored 54 marks. So Tatuya scored: 2 * 54 = 108 marks Now we can find the total marks scored by the three of them: 90 + 54 + 108 = 252 marks Finally, we can calculate the average marks scored by the three: 252 / 3 = 84 marks Therefore, the average marks scored by Tatuya, Ivanna, and Dorothy is 84 marks. The answer is 84.\n\n\nQ: Miriam currently has 30 marbles, but she used to have more. Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, gave her sister twice that amount and gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has. How many marbles did Miriam start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, so she now has 30 - 60 = -30 marbles. This doesn't make sense, so we know that Miriam must have started with more than 60 marbles. Next, we know that Miriam gave her sister twice the amount she gave her brother, so her sister received 2 * 60 = 120 marbles. We also know that Miriam gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has, so Savanna received 3 * 30 = 90 marbles. In total, Miriam gave away 60 + 120 + 90 = 270 marbles. If Miriam started with x marbles, we can set up the equation: x - 270 = 30 Solving for x, we get: x = 300 Therefore, Miriam started with 300 marbles. The answer is 300.\n\n\nQ: Frankie and Carla played 30 games of ping pong against each other.  Frankie won half as many games as did Carla.  How many games did Carla win?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can start by using algebra to represent the problem. Let's say that Carla won x number of games. Then, we know that Frankie won half as many games as Carla, which means Frankie won (1/2)x games. Next, we know that they played a total of 30 games, so we can set up an equation: x + (1/2)x = 30 We can simplify this equation by combining like terms: (3/2)x = 30 To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/2, which is 2/3: x = (2/3) * 30 x = 20 Therefore, Carla won 20 games. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Merry had 50 boxes of apples on Saturday and 25 boxes on Sunday. There were 10 apples in each box. If she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, how many boxes of apples are left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many apples Merry had in total. On Saturday, she had 50 boxes of apples, and each box had 10 apples, so she had 50 x 10 = 500 apples on Saturday. On Sunday, she had 25 boxes of apples, and each box had 10 apples, so she had 25 x 10 = 250 apples on Sunday. In total, she had 500 + 250 = 750 apples. Next, we need to find out how many apples she sold. We know that she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, so she must have had 750 - 720 = 30 apples left. Finally, we need to find out how many boxes of apples she has left. We know that there are 10 apples in each box, so she must have 30 / 10 = 3 boxes of apples left. Therefore, Merry has 3 boxes of apples left. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Aimee does a poll around her neighborhood and makes sure to get answers from 50% men and 50% women. She finds that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. How many people did she poll?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Aimee polled an equal number of men and women. Therefore, we can assume that 50% of the total number of people she polled are women. Let's call the total number of people she polled \"x\". Then, the number of women she polled is 0.5x. Next, we know that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. Therefore, the number of women in favor of this idea is 0.35(0.5x) = 0.175x. We also know that 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. Therefore, the number of women who did not support shortening the school day is 39. We can set up an equation to solve for x: 0.175x + 39 = 0.5x Simplifying this equation, we get: 39 = 0.325x x = 120 Therefore, Aimee polled 120 people in total. The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: Harold had 100 marbles. He kept 20 marbles and shared the rest evenly among his 5 friends. How many marbles did each friend get?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many marbles Harold gave away. To do this, we need to subtract the number of marbles he kept from the total number of marbles he had: 100 - 20 = 80 So Harold gave away 80 marbles. Step 2: Divide the number of marbles Harold gave away by the number of friends he shared them with. To do this, we need to divide 80 by 5: 80 \u00f7 5 = 16 So each friend got 16 marbles. Therefore, each friend got 16 marbles. The answer is 16.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Mary bought a packet of 1500 stickers. She shared them between Susan, Andrew and Sam in the ratio 1:1:3 respectively. If Sam gave Andrew two-thirds of his own share, how many stickers does Andrew now have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 1+1+3=5. Next, we need to find the size of each part by dividing the total number of stickers by the total number of parts: 1500/5=300. So, Susan and Andrew each get one part, which is 300 stickers each. Sam gets three parts, which is 900 stickers. Now, we need to find out how many stickers Sam gave to Andrew. Two-thirds of Sam's share is (2/3)*900=600. Therefore, Andrew now has 300+600=900 stickers. The answer is 900.\n\n\n"
