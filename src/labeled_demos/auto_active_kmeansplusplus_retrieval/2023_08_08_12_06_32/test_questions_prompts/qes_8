  "formatted_prompt": "Q: There have been 15 \"Where's Waldo?\" books published. Each book has 30 puzzles to find Waldo. The average person takes 3 minutes to find Waldo in a puzzle. How long would it take to find every Waldo?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThere have been 450 puzzles because 15 x 30 = <<450=450>>450\nIt would take 1,350 minutes to find all the Waldo's because 450 x 3 = <<450*3=1350>>1,350 The answer is 1350.\n\n\nQ: New York recorded 5000 new coronavirus cases on a particular week. In the second week, half as many new coronaviruses cases as the first week was recorded by the state. In the third week, 2000 more cases were recorded in the state. What is the total number of recorded new coronaviruses in the state after the three weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nIf there were 5000 new cases on the first week, the total for the second week is 1/2 * 5000 cases = <<5000*1/2=2500>>2500 cases.\nThe total number of new coronavirus cases in the three weeks is 2500 cases + 5000 cases + 2000 cases = <<2500+5000+2000=9500>>9500 cases. The answer is 9500.\n\n\nQ: The gauge on a water tank shows that the tank is 1/3 full of water. To fill the tank, 16 gallons of water are added. How many gallons of water does the tank hold when full?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nGiven that the tank is 1/3 full of water, and that it requires 16 gallons to fill. 1 full tank -1/3 tank = 2/3 of the tank is empty, which is equal to 16 gallons.\nIf 2/3 of the tank equals 16 gallons, this means 1/3 of the tank is equal to 16 / 2 gallons = 8 gallons\nThe total capacity of the tank or how much the tanks holds = 16 + 8 = <<16+8=24>>24 gallons The answer is 24.\n\n\n"
