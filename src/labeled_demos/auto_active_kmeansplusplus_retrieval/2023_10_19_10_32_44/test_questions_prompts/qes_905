  "formatted_prompt": "Q: There are 10 cars parked in a mall\u2019s parking lot, each with the same number of customers inside. Each customer only makes 1 purchase. If the sports store makes 20 sales and the music store makes 30 sales, how many customers are in each of the cars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of sales made in the parking lot. We can do this by adding the number of sales made by the sports store and the music store: 20 + 30 = 50 So, there were 50 purchases made in total. Next, we need to find out how many customers were in each car. We know that there are 10 cars, and each car has the same number of customers. Let's call the number of customers in each car \"x\". So, the total number of customers in all the cars is: 10x And we know that this is equal to the total number of purchases made: 10x = 50 To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 10: x = 5 So, there were 5 customers in each car. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: There are 50 oysters on the rocks at La Push Park and 72 crabs by the beach. Eric, who loves walking by the beach, makes a note of this and goes home. The next day, he realizes only half the number of Oysters were on the rocks, and only 2/3 the number of crabs as the previous day are on the beach. How many oysters and crabs did he count in total in the two days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Eric counted 50 oysters and 72 crabs, so the total number of oysters and crabs he counted on the first day is: 50 + 72 = 122 On the second day, Eric realized only half the number of oysters were on the rocks, which means there were: 50 / 2 = 25 oysters on the rocks on the second day And only 2/3 the number of crabs as the previous day were on the beach, which means there were: 72 x 2/3 = 48 crabs on the beach on the second day So the total number of oysters and crabs Eric counted on the second day is: 25 + 48 = 73 Therefore, the total number of oysters and crabs Eric counted in total in the two days is: 122 + 73 = 195 The answer is 195.\n\n\nQ: Nine hundred tickets were sold to a concert. Three-fourths of those who bought the ticket came before the start of the concert. Five-ninths of the remaining came few minutes after the first song. Eighty people arrived during the middle part of the concert while the rest did not go. How many of those who bought the tickets did not go?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many people came before the start of the concert. Three-fourths of 900 tickets = (3/4) x 900 = 675 people came before the start of the concert. Step 2: Find out how many people were left after the first group came. 900 - 675 = 225 people were left. Step 3: Find out how many people came few minutes after the first song. Five-ninths of the remaining 225 people = (5/9) x 225 = 125 people came few minutes after the first song. Step 4: Find out how many people were left after the second group came. 225 - 125 = 100 people were left. Step 5: Subtract the number of people who arrived during the middle part of the concert from the number of people left. 100 - 80 = 20 people did not go to the concert. Therefore, 20 people who bought the tickets did not go to the concert. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: A group of 30 tourists sets out on a walking tour of the rainforest. Two tourists are eaten by anacondas, then half the remaining tourists try to pet poisonous dart frogs and get poisoned. If only 1/7 of the poisoned tourists recovered, how many tourists are left at the end of the tour?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Start with 30 tourists. Step 2: Two tourists are eaten by anacondas, so we subtract 2 from 30 to get 28 tourists remaining. Step 3: Half of the remaining tourists try to pet poisonous dart frogs and get poisoned. Half of 28 is 14, so we subtract 14 from 28 to get 14 tourists remaining. Step 4: Only 1/7 of the poisoned tourists recovered. 1/7 of 14 is 2, so we add 2 to the 14 tourists remaining to get 16 tourists at the end of the tour. Therefore, there are 16 tourists left at the end of the tour. The answer is 16.\n\n\nQ: Cleo and Ignacio placed 30 of their marbles in a jar on a Monday. They took 3/5 of the marbles from the jar the next day and divided them equally. On the third day, Cleo took 1/2 of the marbles remaining in the jars. How many marbles did Cleo have on the third day?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many marbles were taken from the jar on the second day. 3/5 of 30 marbles = (3/5) x 30 = 18 marbles So, 18 marbles were taken from the jar on the second day. Step 2: Find out how many marbles were left in the jar after the second day. 30 - 18 = 12 marbles So, 12 marbles were left in the jar after the second day. Step 3: Find out how many marbles Cleo took on the third day. 1/2 of 12 marbles = (1/2) x 12 = 6 marbles So, Cleo took 6 marbles on the third day. Step 4: Find out how many marbles Cleo had on the third day. Cleo had 6 marbles on the third day. Therefore, Cleo had 6 marbles on the third day. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Jerry is sweeping up pieces of broken glass in the parking lot. He sweeps up 20 amber pieces, 35 green pieces, and some clear pieces. If the green pieces are 25% of the total glass he sweeps up, how many pieces were clear?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the green pieces are 25% of the total glass, so we can set up an equation: 35 = 0.25x where x is the total number of pieces of glass Jerry sweeps up. We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.25: x = 140 So Jerry sweeps up a total of 140 pieces of glass. We also know that he sweeps up 20 amber pieces and 35 green pieces, so the number of clear pieces must be: 140 - 20 - 35 = 85 Therefore, Jerry swept up 85 clear pieces of glass. The answer is 85.\n\n\nQ: Blanche, Rose and Dorothy liked to collect sea glass when they went to the beach.  Blanche found 12 pieces of green and 3 pieces of red sea glass.  Rose found 9 pieces of red and 11 pieces of blue sea glass.  If Dorothy found twice as many pieces of red glass as Blanche and Rose and three times as much blue sea glass as Rose, how many pieces did Dorothy have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many pieces of red sea glass Blanche and Rose found combined. Blanche found 3 pieces of red sea glass and Rose found 9 pieces of red sea glass, so together they found 3 + 9 = 12 pieces of red sea glass. Next, let's find out how many pieces of blue sea glass Rose found. Rose found 11 pieces of blue sea glass. Now, let's use the information given to find out how many pieces of red and blue sea glass Dorothy found. We know that Dorothy found twice as many pieces of red sea glass as Blanche and Rose combined, which is 2 * 12 = 24 pieces of red sea glass. We also know that Dorothy found three times as much blue sea glass as Rose, which is 3 * 11 = 33 pieces of blue sea glass. Finally, we can add up all the pieces of sea glass that Dorothy found: 24 pieces of red sea glass + 33 pieces of blue sea glass = 57 pieces of sea glass in total. Therefore, Dorothy found 57 pieces of sea glass. The answer is 57.\n\n\n"
