  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Hanna has twice as many erasers as Rachel.  Rachel has three less than one-half as many erasers as Tanya has red erasers.  If Tanya has 20 erasers, and half of them are red, how many erasers does Hanna have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red erasers Tanya has. We know that half of her erasers are red, so: 20/2 = 10 red erasers Next, we need to figure out how many erasers Rachel has. We know that Rachel has three less than one-half as many erasers as Tanya has red erasers, so: (1/2) * 20 - 3 = 7 erasers Finally, we need to find out how many erasers Hanna has, since we know she has twice as many as Rachel. Therefore: 2 * 7 = 14 erasers So, Hanna has 14 erasers. The answer is 14.\n\n\nQ: Merry had 50 boxes of apples on Saturday and 25 boxes on Sunday. There were 10 apples in each box. If she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, how many boxes of apples are left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many apples Merry had in total. On Saturday, she had 50 boxes of apples, and each box had 10 apples, so she had 50 x 10 = 500 apples on Saturday. On Sunday, she had 25 boxes of apples, and each box had 10 apples, so she had 25 x 10 = 250 apples on Sunday. In total, she had 500 + 250 = 750 apples. Next, we need to find out how many apples she sold. We know that she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, so she must have had 750 - 720 = 30 apples left. Finally, we need to find out how many boxes of apples she has left. We know that there are 10 apples in each box, so she must have 30 / 10 = 3 boxes of apples left. Therefore, Merry has 3 boxes of apples left. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Penelope has 5 M&M candies for every 3 Starbursts candies. If she has 25 M&M candies, how many Starbursts candies does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out the ratio of M&M candies to Starbursts candies. According to the problem, Penelope has 5 M&M candies for every 3 Starbursts candies. This can be written as: 5 M&M candies : 3 Starbursts candies Next, we need to use this ratio to figure out how many Starbursts candies Penelope has. We know that she has 25 M&M candies, so we can set up a proportion: 5 M&M candies / 3 Starbursts candies = 25 M&M candies / x Starbursts candies To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 5 M&M candies * x Starbursts candies = 3 Starbursts candies * 25 M&M candies 5x = 75 x = 15 Therefore, Penelope has 15 Starbursts candies. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Nori had 4 boxes of crayons with 8 crayons in each box. She gave 5 crayons to Mae and also give some crayons to Lea. How many more crayons did she give to Lea than Mae if she has only 15 crayons left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many crayons Nori had in total. 4 boxes x 8 crayons per box = 32 crayons Next, we need to subtract the 5 crayons Nori gave to Mae. 32 crayons - 5 crayons = 27 crayons We know that Nori has 15 crayons left, so we can subtract that from the 27 crayons to find out how many crayons she gave to Lea. 27 crayons - 15 crayons = 12 crayons Therefore, Nori gave 12 crayons to Lea. To find out how many more crayons Nori gave to Lea than Mae, we can subtract the 5 crayons from Mae from the 12 crayons given to Lea. 12 crayons - 5 crayons = 7 crayons So Nori gave 7 more crayons to Lea than Mae. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Miriam currently has 30 marbles, but she used to have more. Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, gave her sister twice that amount and gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has. How many marbles did Miriam start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, so she now has 30 - 60 = -30 marbles. This doesn't make sense, so we know that Miriam must have started with more than 60 marbles. Next, we know that Miriam gave her sister twice the amount she gave her brother, so her sister received 2 * 60 = 120 marbles. We also know that Miriam gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has, so Savanna received 3 * 30 = 90 marbles. In total, Miriam gave away 60 + 120 + 90 = 270 marbles. If Miriam started with x marbles, we can set up the equation: x - 270 = 30 Solving for x, we get: x = 300 Therefore, Miriam started with 300 marbles. The answer is 300.\n\n\nQ: Shelby was having a movie party for her birthday. She and her mom made a dozen bags of buttered popcorn and 10 bags of caramel popcorn. Her brother Alan took 3 bags of buttered popcorn and 1 bag of caramel popcorn for his friends. How many bags of popcorn does Shelby have left for the party?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine how many bags of popcorn Shelby had before her brother took some. Shelby had a dozen bags of buttered popcorn, which is equal to 12. She also had 10 bags of caramel popcorn. So, in total, she had 12 + 10 = 22 bags of popcorn. Next, we need to subtract the bags of popcorn that Alan took. Alan took 3 bags of buttered popcorn and 1 bag of caramel popcorn, which is a total of 4 bags. So, Shelby is left with 22 - 4 = 18 bags of popcorn for the party. Therefore, Shelby has 18 bags of popcorn left for the party. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Oliver had $9, then he saved $5 from his allowance and spent $4 on a frisbee and $3 on a puzzle. His friend gives him another $8 as it's his birthday. How much money does Oliver have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. Oliver had $9. He saved $5 from his allowance, so he now has $9 + $5 = $14. He spent $4 on a frisbee, so he now has $14 - $4 = $10. He spent another $3 on a puzzle, so he now has $10 - $3 = $7. His friend gives him another $8, so he now has $7 + $8 = $15. Therefore, Oliver has $15 left. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Last night Kannon had 3 apples, a banana, and 4 oranges for dinner. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, and twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today. How many fruits would she have eaten so far in the two meals?\nA: Let's think step by step. Last night Kannon had 3 apples, 1 banana, and 4 oranges, so she had a total of 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 fruits. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, which means she will have 3 + 4 = 7 apples today. She is also planning to have 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, which means she will have 1 x 10 = 10 bananas today. Finally, she is planning to have twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today, which means she will have 7 x 2 = 14 oranges today. Therefore, in total, Kannon will have eaten 7 + 10 + 14 = 31 fruits in the two meals. The answer is 31.\n\n\n"
