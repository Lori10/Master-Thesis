  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Betsy is sewing a quilt.  The quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side.  Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together.  How many more squares does she need to sew together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many squares Betsy has already sewn together. If the quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side, then the total number of squares in the quilt is: 16 x 16 = 256 squares If Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together, then she has sewn: 0.25 x 256 = 64 squares Now we need to find out how many more squares she needs to sew together. To do this, we can subtract the number of squares she has already sewn from the total number of squares in the quilt: 256 - 64 = 192 squares So Betsy still needs to sew together 192 squares to complete the quilt. The answer is 192.\n\n\nQ: Norma takes her clothes to the laundry. She leaves 9 T-shirts and twice as many sweaters as T-shirts in the washer. When she returns she finds 3 sweaters and triple the number of T-shirts. How many items are missing?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Norma left 9 T-shirts in the washer. Next, we know that she left twice as many sweaters as T-shirts in the washer. So, she left 2 x 9 = 18 sweaters in the washer. When she returns, she finds 3 sweaters and triple the number of T-shirts. So, she finds 3 sweaters + 3 x 9 = 30 T-shirts. To find out how many items are missing, we need to add up the total number of items that Norma left in the washer and subtract the total number of items that she found when she returned. Total items left in washer: 9 T-shirts + 18 sweaters = 27 items Total items found when she returned: 3 sweaters + 30 T-shirts = 33 items So, the number of items missing is: 33 - 27 = 6 items. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Kendra made 4 more than five times as many decorated buttons as Mari. Sue made half as many as Kendra. Mari made 8 buttons. How many did Sue make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many buttons Kendra made. We know that Kendra made 4 more than five times as many decorated buttons as Mari, and Mari made 8 buttons. So, we can write an equation: Kendra's buttons = 4 + 5 x Mari's buttons Kendra's buttons = 4 + 5 x 8 Kendra's buttons = 44 Therefore, Kendra made 44 buttons. Next, we need to find out how many buttons Sue made. We know that Sue made half as many as Kendra, so we can write another equation: Sue's buttons = 1/2 x Kendra's buttons Sue's buttons = 1/2 x 44 Sue's buttons = 22 Therefore, Sue made 22 buttons. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Anna wants to plant red and yellow tulips in the shape of a smiley face. She needs 8 red tulips for each eye and 18 red tulips for the smile. If she needs 9 times the number of tulips in the smile to make the yellow background of the face, how many tulips does she need total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many red tulips Anna needs in total. She needs 8 red tulips for each eye, so for both eyes, she needs 8 x 2 = 16 red tulips. She also needs 18 red tulips for the smile. Therefore, she needs a total of 16 + 18 = 34 red tulips. Next, we need to figure out how many yellow tulips Anna needs. We know that she needs 9 times the number of tulips in the smile to make the yellow background of the face. Since she needs 18 red tulips for the smile, she needs 9 x 18 = 162 yellow tulips. Finally, we can add the number of red and yellow tulips together to find the total number of tulips Anna needs. She needs 34 red tulips and 162 yellow tulips, so she needs a total of 34 + 162 = 196 tulips in total. The answer is 196.\n\n\nQ: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Bertha started with two balls and gave one to her partner, so she has one ball left. Next, we need to figure out how many balls she loses and how many wear out. In 20 games, she loses 20/5 = 4 balls and 20/10 = 2 balls wear out. Finally, we need to figure out how many balls she buys. In 20 games, she buys 20/4 = 5 canisters of three balls, which is a total of 5*3 = 15 balls. So, in total, Bertha has 1 (starting ball) - 4 (lost balls) - 2 (worn out balls) + 15 (bought balls) = 10 tennis balls. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: James has a small tree outside his window with 30 branches with 90 twigs per branch. 30% of the twigs sprout 4 leaves and the rest sprout 5 leaves. How many leaves are on the tree total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of twigs on the tree. We know that there are 30 branches with 90 twigs per branch, so: 30 branches x 90 twigs per branch = 2700 twigs Next, we need to find how many twigs sprout 4 leaves and how many sprout 5 leaves. We know that 30% of the twigs sprout 4 leaves, so: 30% of 2700 twigs = 0.3 x 2700 = 810 twigs sprout 4 leaves The remaining twigs sprout 5 leaves: 2700 twigs - 810 twigs = 1890 twigs sprout 5 leaves Now we can find the total number of leaves on the tree. Each twig that sprouts 4 leaves contributes 4 leaves, and each twig that sprouts 5 leaves contributes 5 leaves. So: 810 twigs x 4 leaves per twig = 3240 leaves from twigs that sprout 4 leaves 1890 twigs x 5 leaves per twig = 9450 leaves from twigs that sprout 5 leaves The total number of leaves on the tree is: 3240 leaves + 9450 leaves = 12690 leaves Therefore, there are 12690 leaves on the tree in total. The answer is 12690.\n\n\nQ: Becky has 50 necklaces in her jewelry collection. 3 of the necklaces have broken beads so she collects the unbroken beads for crafting and throws the other parts of the 3 the necklaces out. Becky buys 5 new necklaces that week. She decides to give 15 of her old necklaces to her friends as gifts. How many necklaces does she own now?\nA: Let's think step by step. Becky starts with 50 necklaces. She throws out 3 necklaces, so she now has 50 - 3 = 47 necklaces. She buys 5 new necklaces, so she now has 47 + 5 = 52 necklaces. She gives away 15 necklaces, so she now has 52 - 15 = 37 necklaces. Therefore, Becky now owns 37 necklaces. The answer is 37.\n\n\nQ: Marla has a grid of squares that has 10 rows and 15 squares in each row. She colors 4 rows of 6 squares in the middle of the grid with red. She colors all squares on the first 2 and last 2 rows with blue. Then she colors the rest with green. How many squares does Marla color green?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of squares in the grid. We can do this by multiplying the number of rows by the number of squares in each row: 10 rows x 15 squares/row = 150 squares Next, we need to find the number of squares that Marla colors red. She colors 4 rows of 6 squares each, so: 4 rows x 6 squares/row = 24 squares Now we need to find the number of squares that Marla colors blue. She colors the first 2 and last 2 rows, which means she colors a total of: 2 rows x 15 squares/row + 2 rows x 15 squares/row = 60 squares Finally, we can subtract the number of red and blue squares from the total number of squares to find the number of green squares: 150 total squares - 24 red squares - 60 blue squares = 66 green squares Therefore, Marla colors 66 squares green. The answer is 66.\n\n\n"
