  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Anna wants to plant red and yellow tulips in the shape of a smiley face. She needs 8 red tulips for each eye and 18 red tulips for the smile. If she needs 9 times the number of tulips in the smile to make the yellow background of the face, how many tulips does she need total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many red tulips Anna needs in total. She needs 8 red tulips for each eye, so for both eyes, she needs 8 x 2 = 16 red tulips. She also needs 18 red tulips for the smile. Therefore, she needs a total of 16 + 18 = 34 red tulips. Next, we need to figure out how many yellow tulips Anna needs. We know that she needs 9 times the number of tulips in the smile to make the yellow background of the face. Since she needs 18 red tulips for the smile, she needs 9 x 18 = 162 yellow tulips. Finally, we can add the number of red and yellow tulips together to find the total number of tulips Anna needs. She needs 34 red tulips and 162 yellow tulips, so she needs a total of 34 + 162 = 196 tulips in total. The answer is 196.\n\n\nQ: James and 4 of his friends volunteered to plant flowers. In 2 days, they were able to plant a total of 200 flowers. If each of them planted the same number of flowers, how many flowers did James plant in a day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people were planting flowers. We know that James and 4 of his friends volunteered, so there were 5 people in total. Next, we need to find out how many flowers each person planted in 2 days. To do this, we can divide the total number of flowers planted (200) by the number of people (5) and the number of days (2): 200 \u00f7 5 \u00f7 2 = 20 So each person planted 20 flowers in 2 days. Finally, we need to find out how many flowers James planted in 1 day. Since each person planted 20 flowers in 2 days, we can divide that by 2 to find out how many flowers each person planted in 1 day: 20 \u00f7 2 = 10 Therefore, James planted 10 flowers in 1 day. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Jim has 2 rows of 4 trees to start.  When he turns 10 he decides to plant a new row of trees every year on his birthday.  On his 15th birthday after he doubles the number of trees he has.  How many trees does he have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller steps. Step 1: Jim starts with 2 rows of 4 trees each, so he has a total of 2 x 4 = 8 trees. Step 2: Jim plants a new row of trees every year on his birthday, starting from his 10th birthday. So, he plants trees for 15 - 10 = 5 years. Step 3: In these 5 years, Jim plants 5 new rows of trees, one row each year. Step 4: Therefore, Jim now has a total of 2 + 5 = 7 rows of trees. Step 5: Each row has 4 trees, so Jim has a total of 7 x 4 = 28 trees. Step 6: On his 15th birthday, Jim doubles the number of trees he has. So, he now has 28 x 2 = 56 trees. Therefore, Jim has 56 trees after he doubles the number of trees he has on his 15th birthday. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Marla has a grid of squares that has 10 rows and 15 squares in each row. She colors 4 rows of 6 squares in the middle of the grid with red. She colors all squares on the first 2 and last 2 rows with blue. Then she colors the rest with green. How many squares does Marla color green?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of squares in the grid. We can do this by multiplying the number of rows by the number of squares in each row: 10 rows x 15 squares/row = 150 squares Next, we need to find the number of squares that Marla colors red. She colors 4 rows of 6 squares each, so: 4 rows x 6 squares/row = 24 squares Now we need to find the number of squares that Marla colors blue. She colors the first 2 and last 2 rows, which means she colors a total of: 2 rows x 15 squares/row + 2 rows x 15 squares/row = 60 squares Finally, we can subtract the number of red and blue squares from the total number of squares to find the number of green squares: 150 total squares - 24 red squares - 60 blue squares = 66 green squares Therefore, Marla colors 66 squares green. The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: A flower shop sells bouquets of roses, which each contain 12 roses, and bouquets of daisies, which each contain an equal amount of daisies. The flower shop sells 20 bouquets today. 10 of these were rose bouquets and the remaining 10 bouquets were daisy bouquets. If the flower shop has sold 190 flowers in total today, how many daisies are in each bouquet of daisies?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the flower shop sold 10 bouquets of roses, each containing 12 roses, so they sold a total of 10 x 12 = 120 roses. Next, we know that the flower shop sold 10 bouquets of daisies, and we want to find out how many daisies are in each bouquet. Let's call the number of daisies in each bouquet \"d\". So, the flower shop sold a total of 10 x d = 10d daisies. We also know that the flower shop sold a total of 190 flowers in total today, so: 120 (roses) + 10d (daisies) = 190 Simplifying this equation, we get: 10d = 70 Dividing both sides by 10, we get: d = 7 Therefore, each bouquet of daisies contains 7 daisies. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: June made a design with 20 equal tiles. Three tiles are yellow and the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles. Six tiles are purple and the remaining tiles are white.  How many white tiles are there?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 3 yellow tiles. Next, we know that the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles, so there are 3+1=4 blue tiles. Then, we know that there are 6 purple tiles. So far, we have accounted for 3+4+6=13 tiles. Since there are 20 tiles in total, we can subtract 13 from 20 to find the number of white tiles: 20-13=7 Therefore, there are 7 white tiles in June's design. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: A tomato plant has 100 tomatoes. Jane picks 1/4 of that number for use in their house. After a week, she goes back and picks 20 more tomatoes, and the following week picks twice that number. What's the total number of fruits remaining on the tomato plant?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Jane picks 1/4 of 100 tomatoes, which is 25 tomatoes. So, there are 100 - 25 = 75 tomatoes left on the plant. After a week, Jane picks 20 more tomatoes, so there are 75 - 20 = 55 tomatoes left on the plant. The following week, Jane picks twice the number of tomatoes she picked the previous week, which is 2 * 20 = 40 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes Jane picked is 25 + 20 + 40 = 85 tomatoes. The total number of tomatoes remaining on the plant is 100 - 85 = 15 tomatoes. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: A park has three colors of flowering crepe myrtle trees planted: red, white, and pink. When they bloom, a third of them are pink, but only two are red. Most of them are white. There are 42 crepe myrtle trees in the park. How many have white flowers when they bloom?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that a third of the trees are pink. So, we can find the number of pink trees by dividing the total number of trees by 3: 42 \u00f7 3 = 14 So, there are 14 pink trees in the park. Next, we know that only two trees are red. So, we can subtract those from the total number of trees to find the number of white trees: 42 - 14 - 2 = 26 Therefore, there are 26 crepe myrtle trees with white flowers when they bloom. The answer is 26.\n\n\n"
