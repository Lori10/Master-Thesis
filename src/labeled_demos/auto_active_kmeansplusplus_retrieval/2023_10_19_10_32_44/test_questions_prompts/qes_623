  "test_question": "Q: The basketball team went to the steakhouse to eat dinner.  The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.  The second player ate beef tips, containing 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size.  The third player ate a one-pound steak.  And the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals.

  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Tommy is making steaks for his family. There are 5 of them in total. If each member wants one pound and the steaks are 20 ounces each, how many does he need to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the desired weight of one pound to ounces. Since there are 16 ounces in one pound, each member wants 16 ounces of steak. Next, we need to figure out how many 20-ounce steaks are needed to provide 16 ounces to each member. We can do this by dividing 16 by 20, which gives us 0.8. This means that each member needs 0.8 of a steak. Since we can't buy a fraction of a steak, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Tommy needs to buy one steak for each member of his family, which is a total of 5 steaks. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Alex was having a cookout Friday night and planned to serve burgers to his guests.  He planned to cook 3 burgers for each guest and had invited 10 friends over.  1 of his friends didn't eat meat and said they would bring their own food.  Another one of his friends didn't eat bread and would not need the buns.  The burger buns came 8 to a pack.  How many packs of buns did Alex need to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many guests will be eating burgers. Alex invited 10 friends, but one won't be eating meat, so there will be 9 guests eating burgers. Next, we need to figure out how many burgers Alex will need to cook. He plans to cook 3 burgers for each guest, so he will need to cook 3 x 9 = 27 burgers. Now we need to figure out how many buns Alex will need. Each burger needs 2 buns, but one of his friends won't be eating the buns, so he will only need 2 x 26 = 52 buns. Since the buns come 8 to a pack, we need to divide 52 by 8 to find out how many packs of buns Alex needs to buy. 52 \u00f7 8 = 6.5 Since we can't buy half a pack of buns, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So Alex needs to buy 7 packs of buns. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Phoebe has two pizzas to share with her and three friends. One has pepperoni and the other has cheese. They both have 16 slices. They all eat the same amount. One friend eats only pepperoni, while the rest have an equal number of slices of each. At the end, there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese, how many slices does each person eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 2 pizzas with 16 slices each, so there are a total of 32 slices. Next, we know that one friend only eats pepperoni, so they eat one slice from the pepperoni pizza. That leaves 31 slices, with 15 slices from each pizza. We also know that there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese left. So, the remaining 15 slices are divided equally among the remaining 3 friends, which means each of them eats 5 slices. Therefore, each person eats 1 slice of pepperoni and 5 slices of cheese. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: James takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces.  He splits the pieces between 4 people.  If an orange has 80 calories how many calories does each person get?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pieces James has in total. He takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces, so he has 5 x 8 = 40 pieces in total. Next, we need to divide the pieces between 4 people. To do this, we can divide the total number of pieces by 4: 40 \u00f7 4 = 10 pieces per person. Finally, we need to find out how many calories each person gets. We know that one orange has 80 calories, so each piece has 80 \u00f7 8 = 10 calories. Therefore, each person gets 10 x 10 = 100 calories. So each person gets 100 calories. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: A cake of 400 grams is divided into eight equal parts. Nathalie eats one-eighth of the cake, and Pierre eats double what Nathalie ate. How much did Pierre eat, in grams?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much one-eighth of the cake weighs. We can do this by dividing the weight of the cake (400 grams) by 8: 400 \u00f7 8 = 50 So one-eighth of the cake weighs 50 grams. Next, we need to find out how much Pierre ate, which is double what Nathalie ate. We can do this by multiplying Nathalie's portion (50 grams) by 2: 50 \u00d7 2 = 100 Therefore, Pierre ate 100 grams of the cake. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: A soccer team had 24 players prepared for a soccer game. The first half saw 11 players start the game with 2 substitutions made. In the second half, the team made twice as many substitutions as it made in the first half. How many players on the team did not play that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many players played in the first half. We know that 11 players started the game, and 2 substitutions were made, so a total of 13 players played in the first half. Next, we need to find out how many substitutions were made in the second half. We know that the team made twice as many substitutions as it made in the first half, so that means 2 x 2 = 4 substitutions were made in the second half. Now we can calculate how many players played in the second half. We know that there were 13 players who played in the first half, and 4 substitutions were made, so a total of 17 players played in the second half. Finally, we can calculate how many players did not play that day. We know that the team had 24 players prepared for the game, and 13 players played in the first half, and 17 players played in the second half. So, 24 - 13 - 17 = 4 players did not play that day. Therefore, there were 4 players on the team who did not play that day. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Last night Kannon had 3 apples, a banana, and 4 oranges for dinner. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, and twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today. How many fruits would she have eaten so far in the two meals?\nA: Let's think step by step. Last night Kannon had 3 apples, 1 banana, and 4 oranges, so she had a total of 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 fruits. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, which means she will have 3 + 4 = 7 apples today. She is also planning to have 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, which means she will have 1 x 10 = 10 bananas today. Finally, she is planning to have twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today, which means she will have 7 x 2 = 14 oranges today. Therefore, in total, Kannon will have eaten 7 + 10 + 14 = 31 fruits in the two meals. The answer is 31.\n\n\nQ: A local restaurant is offering an 8 piece fried chicken bucket and 2 sides for $12.00 that will feed 6 people.  If Monty was having a family reunion for 36 family members, how much will it cost him to buy enough chicken and sides to feed everyone one serving?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many servings of chicken and sides Monty needs to feed 36 people. Since the restaurant's 8 piece fried chicken bucket feeds 6 people, we can calculate that Monty needs 6 buckets of chicken to feed 36 people. Next, we need to figure out how many sides Monty needs. The restaurant offers 2 sides with each 8 piece chicken bucket, so Monty needs 6 x 2 = 12 sides. Now, we can calculate the total cost. Monty is paying $12.00 for 6 people, so he needs to pay 6/6 = 1 dollar per person. To feed 36 people, Monty needs to pay 36 x 1 = $36.00 for the chicken and sides. The answer is 36.\n\n\n"
