  "test_question": "Q: Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Jeremy buys 30 watermelons. He eats 3 watermelons per week. Each week he gives 2 to his dad. How many weeks will the watermelons last?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many watermelons Jeremy eats per week and how many he gives to his dad. Jeremy eats 3 watermelons per week and gives 2 to his dad, so he uses a total of 5 watermelons per week. Next, we need to divide the total number of watermelons by the number of watermelons used per week to find out how many weeks the watermelons will last. 30 watermelons \u00f7 5 watermelons per week = 6 weeks Therefore, the watermelons will last for 6 weeks. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: There are four members in one household. Each member consumes 3 slices of bread during breakfast and 2 slices of bread for snacks. A loaf of bread has 12 slices. How many days will five loaves of bread last in this family?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of bread each member consumes per day. For breakfast, each member consumes 3 slices of bread. For snacks, each member consumes 2 slices of bread. So, in total, each member consumes 3 + 2 = 5 slices of bread per day. Since there are four members in the household, the total number of slices of bread consumed per day is 4 x 5 = 20 slices. Now, we need to find out how many days five loaves of bread will last. One loaf of bread has 12 slices, so five loaves of bread have 5 x 12 = 60 slices. If the family consumes 20 slices of bread per day, then 60 slices will last for 60/20 = 3 days. Therefore, five loaves of bread will last for 3 days in this family. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Jan enters a double dutch competition.  After training she doubles her speed which used to be 70 skips per minute.  How many skips does she do in 5 minutes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out Jan's new speed after doubling it. 70 skips per minute x 2 = 140 skips per minute Now that we know Jan's new speed, we can find out how many skips she does in 5 minutes. 140 skips per minute x 5 minutes = 700 skips Therefore, Jan does 700 skips in 5 minutes after doubling her speed. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: James takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces.  He splits the pieces between 4 people.  If an orange has 80 calories how many calories does each person get?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pieces James has in total. He takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces, so he has 5 x 8 = 40 pieces in total. Next, we need to divide the pieces between 4 people. To do this, we can divide the total number of pieces by 4: 40 \u00f7 4 = 10 pieces per person. Finally, we need to find out how many calories each person gets. We know that one orange has 80 calories, so each piece has 80 \u00f7 8 = 10 calories. Therefore, each person gets 10 x 10 = 100 calories. So each person gets 100 calories. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Yvonne swims 10 laps in 5 minutes.  Her younger sister can swim half as many laps as Yvonne in the same time frame.  Their brother Joel can swim three times the number of laps as the youngest sister.  How many laps can Joel swim?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many laps Yvonne's younger sister can swim in 5 minutes. Since she can swim half as many laps as Yvonne, we can divide Yvonne's number of laps by 2: Yvonne's sister = 10 laps / 2 = 5 laps Next, we need to figure out how many laps Joel can swim. We know that he can swim three times the number of laps as the youngest sister, so we can multiply her number of laps by 3: Joel = 5 laps * 3 = 15 laps Therefore, Joel can swim 15 laps in 5 minutes. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Betty and Dora started making some cupcakes at the same time. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour and Dora makes 8 every hour. If Betty took a two-hour break, what is the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Betty made in the first 3 hours before taking a break. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour, so in 3 hours, she would make: 10 cupcakes/hour x 3 hours = 30 cupcakes Next, we need to find out how many cupcakes Dora made in the same 5 hours. Dora makes 8 cupcakes every hour, so in 5 hours, she would make: 8 cupcakes/hour x 5 hours = 40 cupcakes Now we need to find the difference between the number of cupcakes they made. Betty made 30 cupcakes before taking a break, and Dora made 40 cupcakes in the same 5 hours. So the difference between the number of cupcakes they made is: 40 cupcakes - 30 cupcakes = 10 cupcakes Therefore, the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours is 10 cupcakes. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: To make fried green tomatoes, Thelma cuts each green tomato into 8 slices before cooking them up.  If 20 slices of fried green tomato make a meal for a single person, how many tomatoes will Thelma need to make enough fried green tomatoes to feed a family of 8 for a single meal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many slices of fried green tomatoes are needed for a family of 8 for a single meal. We know that 20 slices make a meal for a single person, so for 8 people, we need: 20 slices/person x 8 people = 160 slices Next, we need to figure out how many tomatoes are needed to make 160 slices. We know that Thelma cuts each tomato into 8 slices, so: 160 slices \u00f7 8 slices/tomato = 20 tomatoes Therefore, Thelma will need 20 tomatoes to make enough fried green tomatoes to feed a family of 8 for a single meal. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Don can paint 3 tiles a minute, Ken can paint 2 more tiles a minute than Don and Laura can paint twice as many tiles as Ken. Kim can paint 3 fewer tiles than Laura can in a minute. How many tiles can Don, Ken, Laura and Kim paint in 15 minutes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many tiles each person can paint in one minute. Don can paint 3 tiles a minute. Ken can paint 2 more tiles a minute than Don, so Ken can paint 3 + 2 = 5 tiles a minute. Laura can paint twice as many tiles as Ken, so Laura can paint 5 x 2 = 10 tiles a minute. Kim can paint 3 fewer tiles than Laura can in a minute, so Kim can paint 10 - 3 = 7 tiles a minute. Now that we know how many tiles each person can paint in one minute, we can multiply that by 15 to find out how many tiles they can paint in 15 minutes. Don can paint 3 x 15 = 45 tiles in 15 minutes. Ken can paint 5 x 15 = 75 tiles in 15 minutes. Laura can paint 10 x 15 = 150 tiles in 15 minutes. Kim can paint 7 x 15 = 105 tiles in 15 minutes. Therefore, Don can paint 45 tiles, Ken can paint 75 tiles, Laura can paint 150 tiles, and Kim can paint 105 tiles in 15 minutes. The answer is 15.\n\n\n"
