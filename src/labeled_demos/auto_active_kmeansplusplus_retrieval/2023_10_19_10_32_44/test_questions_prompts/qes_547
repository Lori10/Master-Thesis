  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Doris earns $20 per hour by babysitting. She needs to earn at least $1200 for her monthly expenses. She can babysit for 3 hours every weekday and 5 hours on a Saturday.  How many weeks does it take for Doris to earn enough to cover her monthly expenses?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much Doris earns per week by babysitting. She babysits for 3 hours every weekday, which is a total of 15 hours per week (3 hours x 5 days). She also babysits for 5 hours on a Saturday, which adds another 5 hours to her weekly total. So, in total, she babysits for 20 hours per week. If she earns $20 per hour, then she earns 20 x 20 = $400 per week. To cover her monthly expenses of $1200, she needs to earn 1200 / 400 = 3 weeks of babysitting. Therefore, it takes Doris 3 weeks to earn enough to cover her monthly expenses. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Steve makes 40000$ a year as a teacher.  He loses 20 percent to taxes, 10 percent to healthcare, and 800$ to local union dues.  How much money does Steve take home?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Steve loses to taxes. To do this, we can multiply his salary by the tax rate as a decimal: 20% as a decimal is 0.20 Tax = 40000 x 0.20 = 8000$ Next, we need to find out how much money Steve loses to healthcare. We can use the same method as above: 10% as a decimal is 0.10 Healthcare = 40000 x 0.10 = 4000$ Now we need to subtract the taxes, healthcare, and union dues from Steve's salary to find out how much money he takes home: Take home pay = 40000 - 8000 - 4000 - 800 = 27200$ Therefore, Steve takes home 27200$ after taxes, healthcare, and union dues are deducted from his salary. The answer is 27200.\n\n\nQ: A hairstylist charges $5 for a normal haircut, $6 for a special haircut, and $8 for a trendy haircut. If he cuts 5 normal haircuts, 3 special haircuts, and 2 trendy haircuts per day, how much money does he earn per week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much money the hairstylist earns per day for each type of haircut: - Normal haircut: $5 x 5 = $25 - Special haircut: $6 x 3 = $18 - Trendy haircut: $8 x 2 = $16 So, the hairstylist earns $25 + $18 + $16 = $59 per day. To calculate how much money he earns per week, we need to multiply this amount by the number of days he works in a week. Let's assume he works 6 days a week: - Weekly earnings: $59 x 6 = $354 Therefore, the hairstylist earns $354 per week. The answer is 354.\n\n\nQ: Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how much money Carl will earn in four weeks. If he earns $0.50 every time, and he buys a candy bar each time, that means he's spending $0.50 each week. But he's also earning $0.75 each week for taking out his neighbor's trash. So his net earnings each week are $0.75 - $0.50 = $0.25. Over four weeks, that's a total of $0.25 x 4 = $1. So Carl will have $1 to spend on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.50, he can buy 2 candy bars with his earnings. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Mark loves to see shows in theaters. He decided to visit the theater at least once a week. One performance lasts 3 hours. The price of the ticket depends on the time spent in the theater and stands at $5 for each hour. How much will Mark spend on visits to the theater in 6 weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many performances Mark will attend in 6 weeks. Since he wants to visit the theater at least once a week, we can multiply the number of weeks by 1: 6 weeks x 1 performance per week = 6 performances Next, we need to calculate the cost of each performance. We know that one performance lasts 3 hours, so the cost of one performance will be: 3 hours x $5 per hour = $15 Finally, we can calculate the total cost of all 6 performances by multiplying the cost of one performance by the number of performances: $15 per performance x 6 performances = $90 Therefore, Mark will spend $90 on visits to the theater in 6 weeks. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: Mrs. Thomson received an incentive worth $240. She spent 1/3 of the money on food and 1/5 of it on clothes. Then, she put in her savings account 3/4 of the remaining money. How much money did Mrs. Thomson save?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Mrs. Thomson spent on food. We know that she spent 1/3 of the $240 incentive on food, so we can calculate: 1/3 x $240 = $80 Next, we need to find out how much money she spent on clothes. We know that she spent 1/5 of the $240 incentive on clothes, so we can calculate: 1/5 x $240 = $48 To find out how much money she had left after spending on food and clothes, we need to subtract the amounts she spent from the total incentive: $240 - $80 - $48 = $112 Now we know that Mrs. Thomson had $112 left. She put 3/4 of this amount into her savings account, so we can calculate: 3/4 x $112 = $84 Therefore, Mrs. Thomson saved $84. The answer is 84.\n\n\nQ: Gwen received a $900 bonus at work and decided to invest this money in the stock market.  She spent one-third of her bonus on stock A, one-third on stock B, and the remaining one-third on stock C.   After one year, stock A and stock B had doubled in value, while stock C had lost half of its value.  At the end of the year, how much were Gwen's stocks worth, in dollars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Gwen spent on each stock. Since she spent one-third of her bonus on each stock, we can calculate: - Stock A: 1/3 x $900 = $300 - Stock B: 1/3 x $900 = $300 - Stock C: 1/3 x $900 = $300 Next, we need to calculate the value of each stock after one year: - Stock A: $300 x 2 = $600 - Stock B: $300 x 2 = $600 - Stock C: $300 / 2 = $150 Finally, we can add up the value of all three stocks to find out how much Gwen's stocks are worth after one year: - Total value = $600 + $600 + $150 = $1,350 Therefore, Gwen's stocks are worth $1,350 after one year. The answer is 1350.\n\n\n"
