  "test_question": "Q: Nine of the kids in Gina's class are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts and 3 are allergic to both. If there are 32 kids in her class, how many aren't allergic to anything?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Dani brings two and half dozen cupcakes for her 2nd-grade class.  There are 27 students (including Dani), 1 teacher, and 1 teacher\u2019s aid.  If 3 students called in sick that day, how many cupcakes are left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Dani brought in total. Two and a half dozen cupcakes is equal to 30 cupcakes (since a dozen is 12). Next, we need to figure out how many people will be receiving cupcakes. There are 27 students, 1 teacher, and 1 teacher's aid, for a total of 29 people. However, 3 students called in sick, so we need to subtract them from the total. 29 - 3 = 26 people receiving cupcakes. Now, we need to subtract 26 cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes Dani brought. 30 - 26 = 4 cupcakes left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: MIlle is making snack packs for her kindergarten class. She's going to divide 64 pretzels, four times as many goldfish, and 32 suckers into baggies for the 16 kids in the class. How many items does each baggie have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many goldfish there are. We know that there are four times as many goldfish as pretzels, so: 64 pretzels x 4 = 256 goldfish Next, we need to add up the total number of items: 64 pretzels + 256 goldfish + 32 suckers = 352 items Now we can divide the total number of items by the number of baggies: 352 items \u00f7 16 baggies = 22 items per baggie Therefore, each baggie will have 22 items, which includes pretzels, goldfish, and suckers. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many students are in Alice's class. We know that there are 40 students and 10 instructors, so the total number of people in the class is 40 + 10 = 50. Next, we need to figure out how many students are bringing their own life vests. We know that 20% of the students are bringing life vests, so we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of students by 0.2: 40 x 0.2 = 8. So 8 students are bringing their own life vests. Now we need to figure out how many life vests we still need. We have 20 life vests on hand, and we need one for each of the 50 people in the class. So we need 50 - 20 = 30 more life vests. However, we already know that 8 students are bringing their own life vests, so we can subtract those from the total number we need: 30 - 8 = 22. Therefore, Alice needs to get 22 more life vests so that the entire class has one. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Two-thirds of the class have brown eyes. Half of the students with brown eyes have black hair. If there are 6 students in the class with brown eyes and black hair, how many students are there in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that two-thirds of the class have brown eyes. Let's represent the total number of students in the class as \"x\". Then, we can write: (2/3)x = number of students with brown eyes Next, we know that half of the students with brown eyes have black hair. So, we can take half of the number of students with brown eyes to find the number of students with both brown eyes and black hair: (1/2)(2/3)x = 6 Simplifying this equation, we get: (1/3)x = 6 Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: x = 18 Therefore, there are 18 students in total. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Jackson is making pancakes with three ingredients: flour, milk and eggs. 20% of the bottles of milk are spoiled and the rest are fresh. 60% of the eggs are rotten. 1/4 of the cannisters of flour have weevils in them. If Jackson picks a bottle of milk, an egg and a canister of flour at random, what are the odds all three ingredients will be good?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the probability that a bottle of milk is fresh. We know that 20% of the bottles are spoiled, so 80% are fresh. Next, we need to find the probability that an egg is not rotten. We know that 60% of the eggs are rotten, so 40% are not. Finally, we need to find the probability that a canister of flour does not have weevils. We know that 1/4 of the canisters have weevils, so 3/4 do not. To find the probability that all three ingredients are good, we need to multiply the probabilities of each event happening: 0.8 (probability of fresh milk) x 0.4 (probability of not rotten egg) x 0.75 (probability of no weevils in flour) = 0.24 So the odds of all three ingredients being good are 0.24 or 24%. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Jaylen has 5 carrots and 2 cucumbers. Jaylen has twice as many bell peppers as Kristin. Jaylen has 3 less than half as many green beans as Kristin. If Kristin has 2 bell peppers and 20 green beans, how many vegetables does Jaylen have in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bell peppers Jaylen has. We know that Jaylen has twice as many bell peppers as Kristin, and Kristin has 2 bell peppers. So, Jaylen has 2 x 2 = 4 bell peppers. Next, we need to find out how many green beans Jaylen has. We know that Jaylen has 3 less than half as many green beans as Kristin, and Kristin has 20 green beans. So, half of 20 is 10, and 3 less than 10 is 7. Therefore, Jaylen has 7 green beans. Now, we can add up all the vegetables Jaylen has: 5 carrots + 2 cucumbers + 4 bell peppers + 7 green beans = 18 vegetables in total. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Yvonne brings a box of chocolates to school. Half have nuts and half do not. The students eat 80% of the ones with nuts and eat half of the ones without nuts. If there are 28 chocolates left, how many chocolates were in the box?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that there were x chocolates in the box. Since half of them have nuts and half do not, we can say that there were x/2 chocolates with nuts and x/2 chocolates without nuts. Now, we know that the students ate 80% of the chocolates with nuts, which means they ate 0.8(x/2) = 0.4x chocolates with nuts. They also ate half of the chocolates without nuts, which means they ate 0.5(x/2) = 0.25x chocolates without nuts. In total, the students ate 0.4x + 0.25x = 0.65x chocolates. If there are 28 chocolates left, that means the students ate x - 28 chocolates. So we can set up the equation: 0.65x = x - 28 Solving for x: 0.35x = 28 x = 80 Therefore, there were 80 chocolates in the box. The answer is 80.\n\n\n"
