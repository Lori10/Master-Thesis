  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Enrique has 2 132 contracts that he needs to shred.  His paper shredder will only allow him to shred 6 pages at a time.  How many times will he shred 6 units of paper until all of the contracts are shredded?\nA: Let's think step by step. Enrique has 2 contracts, each with 132 pages. So, he has a total of 2 x 132 = 264 pages to shred. Enrique can shred 6 pages at a time. To find out how many times he needs to shred 6 pages to shred all 264 pages, we can divide 264 by 6: 264 \u00f7 6 = 44 So, Enrique will need to shred 6 pages 44 times to shred all 264 pages. The answer is 264.\n\n\nQ: For homework, Juan's teacher asked everyone in the class, to write down the different types of transportation (cars, trucks, bicycles, skateboards etc) they saw on their way home that afternoon.  After school, Juan walked home and saw the following: 15 cars, 3 bicycles, 8 pickup trucks and 1 tricycle.  How many tires in total were there on the vehicles Juan saw?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine the number of tires on each type of vehicle. - Cars have 4 tires each, so 15 cars would have 15 x 4 = 60 tires. - Bicycles have 2 tires each, so 3 bicycles would have 3 x 2 = 6 tires. - Pickup trucks have 4 tires each, so 8 pickup trucks would have 8 x 4 = 32 tires. - A tricycle has 3 tires. To find the total number of tires, we add up the number of tires for each type of vehicle: 60 + 6 + 32 + 3 = 101 Therefore, Juan saw a total of 101 tires on the vehicles he saw on his way home. The answer is 101.\n\n\nQ: There are 50 oysters on the rocks at La Push Park and 72 crabs by the beach. Eric, who loves walking by the beach, makes a note of this and goes home. The next day, he realizes only half the number of Oysters were on the rocks, and only 2/3 the number of crabs as the previous day are on the beach. How many oysters and crabs did he count in total in the two days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Eric counted 50 oysters and 72 crabs, so the total number of oysters and crabs he counted on the first day is: 50 + 72 = 122 On the second day, Eric realized only half the number of oysters were on the rocks, which means there were: 50 / 2 = 25 oysters on the rocks on the second day And only 2/3 the number of crabs as the previous day were on the beach, which means there were: 72 x 2/3 = 48 crabs on the beach on the second day So the total number of oysters and crabs Eric counted on the second day is: 25 + 48 = 73 Therefore, the total number of oysters and crabs Eric counted in total in the two days is: 122 + 73 = 195 The answer is 195.\n\n\nQ: There are 10 bags with 30 oranges each on a truck. A total of 50 pieces of oranges are rotten. Thirty pieces of oranges will be kept for making orange juice and the rest will be sold. How many pieces of oranges will be sold?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of oranges in the 10 bags. 10 bags x 30 oranges/bag = 300 oranges Next, we need to subtract the number of rotten oranges. 300 oranges - 50 rotten oranges = 250 good oranges Now, we know that 30 oranges will be kept for making juice. 250 good oranges - 30 oranges for juice = 220 oranges to be sold Therefore, 220 pieces of oranges will be sold. The answer is 220.\n\n\nQ: A water tower that serves four neighborhoods around it holds 1200 barrels of water and is filled to the top each week. If one neighborhood uses 150 barrels of water in a week, the second neighborhood uses twice as many barrels of water as the first neighborhood in a week, and the third neighborhood uses one hundred more barrels of water than the second neighborhood in a week, how many barrels are left for the fourth neighborhood?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many barrels of water the second neighborhood uses in a week. We know that the first neighborhood uses 150 barrels, so the second neighborhood uses twice as many, which is 150 x 2 = 300 barrels. Next, we need to find out how many barrels of water the third neighborhood uses in a week. We know that the third neighborhood uses 100 more barrels than the second neighborhood, so that's 300 + 100 = 400 barrels. Now, we can add up the barrels of water used by the first three neighborhoods: 150 + 300 + 400 = 850 barrels. We know that the water tower holds 1200 barrels of water and is filled to the top each week, so to find out how many barrels are left for the fourth neighborhood, we can subtract the barrels used by the first three neighborhoods from the total capacity of the water tower: 1200 - 850 = 350 barrels. Therefore, the fourth neighborhood has 350 barrels of water left for the week. The answer is 350.\n\n\nQ: Two-thirds of the class have brown eyes. Half of the students with brown eyes have black hair. If there are 6 students in the class with brown eyes and black hair, how many students are there in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that two-thirds of the class have brown eyes. Let's represent the total number of students in the class as \"x\". Then, we can write: (2/3)x = number of students with brown eyes Next, we know that half of the students with brown eyes have black hair. So, we can take half of the number of students with brown eyes to find the number of students with both brown eyes and black hair: (1/2)(2/3)x = 6 Simplifying this equation, we get: (1/3)x = 6 Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: x = 18 Therefore, there are 18 students in total. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Shane prepares sandwiches for the Boy Scouts. He buys 2 packages of sliced bread containing 20 slices each, and he also buys 2 packages of sliced ham containing 8 slices each. Shane will make as many sandwiches as he can according to the ham he has. How many slices of bread will he have leftover?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of ham Shane has in total. 2 packages of sliced ham containing 8 slices each = 2 x 8 = 16 slices of ham Now, we know that Shane will make as many sandwiches as he can according to the ham he has. Since each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread, we can calculate the maximum number of sandwiches he can make: 16 slices of ham / 2 slices of bread per sandwich = 8 sandwiches So, Shane will make 8 sandwiches. Each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread, so he will use: 8 sandwiches x 2 slices of bread per sandwich = 16 slices of bread Shane has 2 packages of sliced bread containing 20 slices each, so he has: 2 packages x 20 slices per package = 40 slices of bread Therefore, he will have: 40 slices of bread - 16 slices of bread used = 24 slices of bread leftover. So, Shane will have 24 slices of bread leftover. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Marly is making soup. He adds 2 quarts of milk and three times as much chicken stock to 1 quart of pureed vegetables. Then he divides the soup into bags that can hold 3 quarts each. How many bags does he need?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Marly adds 2 quarts of milk and three times as much chicken stock to 1 quart of pureed vegetables. This means he adds 2 + 3(1) = 5 quarts of liquid to the vegetables. Next, Marly has a total of 5 + 1 = 6 quarts of soup. To find out how many bags he needs, we need to divide the total amount of soup by the amount each bag can hold. So, we have: 6 quarts \u00f7 3 quarts/bag = 2 bags Therefore, Marly needs 2 bags to hold all of his soup. The answer is 2.\n\n\n"
