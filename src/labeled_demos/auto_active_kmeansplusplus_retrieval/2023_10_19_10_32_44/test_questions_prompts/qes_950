  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Aubree saw 20 beavers and 40 chipmunks by a tree when going to school and scared them away when they saw her. While coming back from school, she realized the number of beavers had doubled and the number of chipmunks had decreased by 10. What's the total number of animals she saw that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Aubree saw 20 beavers and 40 chipmunks, so the total number of animals she saw was 20 + 40 = 60. Then, on her way back from school, the number of beavers doubled to 20 x 2 = 40. The number of chipmunks decreased by 10, so there were 40 - 10 = 30 chipmunks. Therefore, the total number of animals Aubree saw that day was 40 + 30 = 70. So, Aubree saw a total of 70 animals that day. The answer is 70.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Jeff has a shelter where he currently takes care of 20 cats. On Monday he found 2 kittens in a box and took them to the shelter. On Tuesday he found 1 more cat with a leg injury. On Wednesday 3 people adopted 2 cats each. How many cats does Jeff currently have in his shelter?\nA: Let's think step by step. Jeff had 20 cats in his shelter. On Monday he found 2 kittens and took them to the shelter, so he now has 20 + 2 = 22 cats. On Tuesday he found 1 more cat with a leg injury, so he now has 22 + 1 = 23 cats. On Wednesday, 3 people adopted 2 cats each, which means a total of 3 x 2 = 6 cats were adopted. Therefore, Jeff currently has 23 - 6 = 17 cats in his shelter. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Jason, Ryan, and Jeffery went fishing at the lake. Ryan caught three times the number of fish that Jason caught. Jefferey caught twice the number of fish that Ryan got.  If Jeffery caught 60 fish, how many fish did all of them catch in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Jeffery caught 60 fish. Next, we know that Jeffery caught twice the number of fish that Ryan caught. So, Ryan must have caught 60/2 = 30 fish. Finally, we know that Ryan caught three times the number of fish that Jason caught. So, Jason must have caught 30/3 = 10 fish. Therefore, the total number of fish caught by all of them is 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 fish. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Van Helsing gets paid by the town to remove all the vampires and werewolves. He gets $5 per vampire and $10 per werewolf. He removes half the vampires and removes 8 werewolves, and earned $105. There were 4 times as many werewolves as vampires. What percentage of the werewolves did he remove?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assign variables to the unknowns in the problem. Let's call the number of vampires \"V\" and the number of werewolves \"W\". We know that Van Helsing gets paid $5 per vampire and removes half of them, so he earns 5*(1/2)V = 2.5V dollars from the vampires. We also know that he gets paid $10 per werewolf and removes 8 of them, so he earns 10*(W-8) dollars from the werewolves. Finally, we know that there were 4 times as many werewolves as vampires, so W = 4V. Putting all of this together, we can create an equation to solve for V: 2.5V + 10(4V-8) = 105 Simplifying this equation, we get: 42.5V = 185 V = 4.35 Since we can't have a fraction of a vampire, we'll round up to 5 vampires. Using the equation W = 4V, we can find that there were 20 werewolves. Van Helsing removed 8 werewolves, so he removed 8/20 = 0.4 or 40% of the werewolves. The answer is 40.\n\n\nQ: A snail kite is a kind of bird that eats apple snails. On the first day, a snail kite ate 3 snails. Then it eats 2 more snails than it did the day before. How many apple snails in all did a snail kite eat for 5 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, the snail kite ate 3 snails. On the second day, it ate 2 more snails than the day before, so it ate 3 + 2 = 5 snails. On the third day, it ate 2 more snails than the day before, so it ate 5 + 2 = 7 snails. On the fourth day, it ate 2 more snails than the day before, so it ate 7 + 2 = 9 snails. On the fifth day, it ate 2 more snails than the day before, so it ate 9 + 2 = 11 snails. To find the total number of snails the snail kite ate for 5 days, we add up the number of snails it ate each day: 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 35. Therefore, the snail kite ate 35 apple snails in all for 5 days. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Last night Kannon had 3 apples, a banana, and 4 oranges for dinner. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, and twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today. How many fruits would she have eaten so far in the two meals?\nA: Let's think step by step. Last night Kannon had 3 apples, 1 banana, and 4 oranges, so she had a total of 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 fruits. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, which means she will have 3 + 4 = 7 apples today. She is also planning to have 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, which means she will have 1 x 10 = 10 bananas today. Finally, she is planning to have twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today, which means she will have 7 x 2 = 14 oranges today. Therefore, in total, Kannon will have eaten 7 + 10 + 14 = 31 fruits in the two meals. The answer is 31.\n\n\nQ: Lassie eats half of her bones on Saturday. On Sunday she received 10 more bones. She now has a total of 35 bones. How many bones did she start with before eating them on Saturday?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Lassie ate half of her bones on Saturday. Let's call the total number of bones she started with \"x\". Then, we can write an equation: x/2 This represents the number of bones Lassie had left after eating half of them on Saturday. Next, we know that on Sunday she received 10 more bones. So we can add 10 to the number of bones she had left: x/2 + 10 This represents the total number of bones she had on Sunday. Finally, we know that she now has a total of 35 bones. So we can set up another equation: x/2 + 10 = 35 Now we can solve for x: x/2 = 25 x = 50 Therefore, Lassie started with 50 bones before eating them on Saturday. The answer is 50.\n\n\n"
