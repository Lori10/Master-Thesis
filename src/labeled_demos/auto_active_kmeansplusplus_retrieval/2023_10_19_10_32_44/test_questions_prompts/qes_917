  "test_question": "Q: In a neighborhood, the number of rabbits pets is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. If there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, how many pets in total are in the neighborhood?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Jeff has a shelter where he currently takes care of 20 cats. On Monday he found 2 kittens in a box and took them to the shelter. On Tuesday he found 1 more cat with a leg injury. On Wednesday 3 people adopted 2 cats each. How many cats does Jeff currently have in his shelter?\nA: Let's think step by step. Jeff had 20 cats in his shelter. On Monday he found 2 kittens and took them to the shelter, so he now has 20 + 2 = 22 cats. On Tuesday he found 1 more cat with a leg injury, so he now has 22 + 1 = 23 cats. On Wednesday, 3 people adopted 2 cats each, which means a total of 3 x 2 = 6 cats were adopted. Therefore, Jeff currently has 23 - 6 = 17 cats in his shelter. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Aubree saw 20 beavers and 40 chipmunks by a tree when going to school and scared them away when they saw her. While coming back from school, she realized the number of beavers had doubled and the number of chipmunks had decreased by 10. What's the total number of animals she saw that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Aubree saw 20 beavers and 40 chipmunks, so the total number of animals she saw was 20 + 40 = 60. Then, on her way back from school, the number of beavers doubled to 20 x 2 = 40. The number of chipmunks decreased by 10, so there were 40 - 10 = 30 chipmunks. Therefore, the total number of animals Aubree saw that day was 40 + 30 = 70. So, Aubree saw a total of 70 animals that day. The answer is 70.\n\n\nQ: Melly's two cats each have litters of kittens at the same time. The first cat has 3 blue-eyed kittens and 7 brown-eyed kittens. The second cat has 4 blue-eyed kittens and 6 brown-eyed kittens. What percentage of all the kittens have blue eyes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of kittens. The first cat has 3 + 7 = 10 kittens. The second cat has 4 + 6 = 10 kittens. So, the total number of kittens is 10 + 10 = 20. Next, we need to find the total number of blue-eyed kittens. The first cat has 3 blue-eyed kittens. The second cat has 4 blue-eyed kittens. So, the total number of blue-eyed kittens is 3 + 4 = 7. To find the percentage of kittens with blue eyes, we need to divide the number of blue-eyed kittens by the total number of kittens and then multiply by 100. 7/20 x 100 = 35 Therefore, 35% of all the kittens have blue eyes. The answer is 35.\n\n\nQ: Mr. Sean has a veterinary clinic where he charges clients $60 to treat a dog and $40 to care for a cat. If Khalil took 20 dogs and 60 cats to the clinic for treatment, how much money did he pay Mr. Sean?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of treating 20 dogs. 20 dogs x $60/dog = $1200 Next, we need to calculate the cost of caring for 60 cats. 60 cats x $40/cat = $2400 Finally, we add the cost of treating the dogs and caring for the cats to find the total cost. $1200 + $2400 = $3600 Therefore, Khalil paid Mr. Sean $3600 for treating 20 dogs and 60 cats. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: James has five huskies, two pitbulls and four golden retrievers, all female. They became pregnant and each golden retriever had two more pups than each husky. If the huskies and pitbulls had 3 pups each, How many more pups than adult dogs are there in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many golden retriever pups were born. We know that each golden retriever had two more pups than each husky, so if the huskies had 3 pups each, then the golden retrievers had 3+2=5 pups each. So, the total number of golden retriever pups is 5 x 4 = 20. The huskies and pitbulls had 3 pups each, so the total number of husky and pitbull pups is (5+2) x 3 = 21. Therefore, the total number of pups is 20 + 21 = 41. There were 11 adult dogs (5 huskies + 2 pitbulls + 4 golden retrievers), so there are 41 - 11 = 30 more pups than adult dogs. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: Bingo has two dogs. On average, they walk a total of 70 miles a week. The first dog walks an average of 2 miles a day. How many miles a day does the other dog average?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many miles the first dog walks in a week. We can do this by multiplying the number of miles the dog walks in a day by the number of days in a week: 2 miles/day x 7 days/week = 14 miles/week Now we can find out how many miles the second dog walks in a week by subtracting the first dog's weekly distance from the total weekly distance: 70 miles/week - 14 miles/week = 56 miles/week Finally, we can find out how many miles the second dog walks in a day by dividing its weekly distance by the number of days in a week: 56 miles/week \u00f7 7 days/week = 8 miles/day Therefore, the second dog averages 8 miles a day. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: The white rabbit can hop 15 meters in one minute. The brown rabbit hops 12 meters per minute. What is the total distance the two rabbits will hop in 5 minutes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how far the white rabbit can hop in 5 minutes. To do this, we can multiply its speed by the time: 15 meters/minute x 5 minutes = 75 meters So the white rabbit can hop 75 meters in 5 minutes. Next, we need to find out how far the brown rabbit can hop in 5 minutes. Again, we can multiply its speed by the time: 12 meters/minute x 5 minutes = 60 meters So the brown rabbit can hop 60 meters in 5 minutes. To find the total distance the two rabbits will hop in 5 minutes, we simply add their distances: 75 meters + 60 meters = 135 meters Therefore, the two rabbits will hop a total distance of 135 meters in 5 minutes. The answer is 5.\n\n\n"
