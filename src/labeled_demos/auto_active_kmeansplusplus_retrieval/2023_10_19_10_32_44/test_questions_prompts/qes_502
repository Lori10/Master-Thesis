  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Some friends went hiking for 3.5 hours. They traveled 21 kilometers in that time. Birgit was 4 minutes/km faster than the average time. If Birgit kept the same pace, how many minutes would it take her to go 8 kilometers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the average speed of the group. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken: Average speed = distance/time = 21 km/3.5 hours = 6 km/hour Next, we need to find Birgit's speed. We know that she was 4 minutes/km faster than the average time, which means she completed each kilometer in (60-4) = 56 minutes. So her speed was: Birgit's speed = 1 km/56 minutes = 0.018 km/minute Finally, we need to find how long it would take Birgit to travel 8 kilometers at this speed. We can use the formula: Time = distance/speed Time = 8 km / 0.018 km/minute = 444.44 minutes So it would take Birgit approximately 444.44 minutes to travel 8 kilometers at the same pace. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: A car driving cross-country traveled 180 miles in 4 hours. At this rate of speed, how many miles further will the car travel in the next 3 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the car's speed in miles per hour (mph). To do this, we divide the distance traveled by the time taken: Speed = Distance \u00f7 Time Speed = 180 miles \u00f7 4 hours Speed = 45 mph Now that we know the car's speed, we can use it to calculate how far it will travel in the next 3 hours: Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time Distance = 45 mph \u00d7 3 hours Distance = 135 miles Therefore, the car will travel 135 miles further in the next 3 hours. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Gilbert, the bearded dragon, eats 4 crickets per week when the temperature averages 90 degrees F per day, but he eats twice as many crickets per week when the temperature averages 100 degrees F.  How many crickets will he eat over 15 weeks if the temperature averages 90 degrees F for 80% of the time, and 100 degrees F for the remainder of the time?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many weeks Gilbert will be eating 4 crickets per week. Since the temperature averages 90 degrees F for 80% of the time, that means he will be eating 4 crickets per week for 80% of 15 weeks, which is 12 weeks. Next, we need to find out how many weeks Gilbert will be eating twice as many crickets per week. Since the temperature averages 100 degrees F for the remaining 20% of the time, that means he will be eating twice as many crickets per week for 20% of 15 weeks, which is 3 weeks. Now we can calculate how many crickets Gilbert will eat in total. For the 12 weeks he eats 4 crickets per week, he will eat a total of 4 x 12 = 48 crickets. For the 3 weeks he eats twice as many crickets per week, he will eat a total of 2 x 4 = 8 crickets per week, or 8 x 3 = 24 crickets in total. Adding these two totals together, Gilbert will eat a total of 48 + 24 = 72 crickets over 15 weeks. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Silvio was running a race that had 4 parts. The total length of the race was 74.5 kilometers. The first part of the race is 15.5 kilometers long. The second and third parts are each 21.5 kilometers long. How many kilometers is the last part of the race?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to add up the lengths of the first three parts of the race: 15.5 km + 21.5 km + 21.5 km = 58.5 km We know that the total length of the race is 74.5 km, so we can subtract the sum of the first three parts from the total length to find the length of the last part: 74.5 km - 58.5 km = 16 km Therefore, the last part of the race is 16 kilometers long. The answer is 16.\n\n\nQ: Ann can skate 6 miles an hour. Her friend Glenda can skate 8 miles an hour. If they start in the same place and skate in straight lines in opposite directions for 3 hours, how many miles apart do they end up?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how far Ann and Glenda each skate in 3 hours. Ann: 6 miles/hour x 3 hours = 18 miles Glenda: 8 miles/hour x 3 hours = 24 miles Step 2: Add the distances they each skated to find the total distance between them. 18 miles + 24 miles = 42 miles Therefore, Ann and Glenda end up 42 miles apart after skating in opposite directions for 3 hours. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: In mid-May, the depth of a river in Moreland is measured. By mid-June, the river is 10 feet deeper than mid-May. By mid-July, the river is three times deeper than mid-June. If the river is 45 feet deep in mid-July, how many feet deep was the river in mid-May?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that in mid-June, the river is 10 feet deeper than mid-May. So, if we let x be the depth of the river in mid-May, then the depth of the river in mid-June is x + 10. Next, we know that in mid-July, the river is three times deeper than mid-June. So, if we let y be the depth of the river in mid-July, then we can write: y = 3(x + 10) We also know that the river is 45 feet deep in mid-July, so we can substitute that into the equation: 45 = 3(x + 10) Simplifying the equation, we get: 15 = x + 10 Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 5 = x Therefore, the river was 5 feet deep in mid-May. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Six more than twice as many ducks go to North Pond as go to Lake Michigan. If Lake Michigan has 100 ducks, how many ducks can you safely estimate there will be at North Pond?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many ducks go to North Pond. We know that \"Six more than twice as many ducks go to North Pond as go to Lake Michigan.\" So, we can start by finding twice as many ducks as Lake Michigan: 2 x 100 = 200 Now, we add six to that: 200 + 6 = 206 Therefore, we can safely estimate that there will be 206 ducks at North Pond. The answer is 206.\n\n\nQ: Stephen made 10 round trips up and down a 40,000 foot tall mountain. If he reached 3/4 of the mountain's height on each of his trips, calculate the total distance he covered.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much of the mountain Stephen climbed on each trip. If he reached 3/4 of the mountain's height on each trip, we can calculate this by multiplying the mountain's height by 3/4: 3/4 * 40,000 = 30,000 feet So Stephen climbed 30,000 feet on each trip. Since he made 10 round trips, we can multiply this by 20 to find out how much he climbed in total: 30,000 * 20 = 600,000 feet Therefore, Stephen covered a total distance of 600,000 feet. The answer is 600000.\n\n\n"
