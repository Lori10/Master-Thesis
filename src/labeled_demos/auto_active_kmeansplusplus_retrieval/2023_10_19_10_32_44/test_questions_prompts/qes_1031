  "test_question": "Q: Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles.  But Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%.  If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, how fast can Gerald, with his improved diet, run the 400-meter hurdles, in seconds?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Charlie can make 5350 steps while running on a 3-kilometer running field. If he can run around the field 2 1/2 times during a running session, how many steps was he able to make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many steps Charlie takes per kilometer. To do this, we can divide the total number of steps (5350) by the distance he runs (3 kilometers): 5350 steps \u00f7 3 kilometers = 1783.33 steps/kilometer Next, we need to find out how far Charlie runs during one lap around the field. We know that he runs around the field 2 1/2 times, which is the same as 2.5 laps. Since the field is 3 kilometers long, one lap around the field is: 3 kilometers/lap So, 2.5 laps around the field is: 2.5 laps x 3 kilometers/lap = 7.5 kilometers Finally, we can use the steps per kilometer ratio we found earlier to calculate how many steps Charlie takes during 7.5 kilometers: 1783.33 steps/kilometer x 7.5 kilometers = 13375 steps Therefore, Charlie was able to make 13375 steps during his running session. The answer is 13375.\n\n\nQ: Jan enters a double dutch competition.  After training she doubles her speed which used to be 70 skips per minute.  How many skips does she do in 5 minutes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out Jan's new speed after doubling it. 70 skips per minute x 2 = 140 skips per minute Now that we know Jan's new speed, we can find out how many skips she does in 5 minutes. 140 skips per minute x 5 minutes = 700 skips Therefore, Jan does 700 skips in 5 minutes after doubling her speed. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Albert has to run 99 meters in gym class. The track is 9 meters around. He has already run 6 times around it. Once he finishes, how many more complete laps will he have made around the track?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many meters Albert has already run. We know that he has run 6 times around the track, and the track is 9 meters around, so: 6 x 9 = 54 meters Albert has already run 54 meters. Next, we need to find out how many meters he still needs to run: 99 - 54 = 45 meters Now we need to figure out how many complete laps he can make with the remaining 45 meters. Since the track is 9 meters around, we can divide 45 by 9 to find out how many complete laps he can make: 45 \u00f7 9 = 5 Albert can make 5 more complete laps around the track once he finishes. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Colin ran his first mile in 6 minutes.  He ran his next two miles in 5 minutes each and finished his 4th mile in 4 minutes.  What was the average time it took him to run a mile?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total time it took Colin to run all four miles. - Colin's first mile took 6 minutes. - His next two miles took 5 minutes each, so that's a total of 10 minutes. - His fourth mile took 4 minutes. To find the total time, we add these up: 6 + 10 + 4 = 20 So Colin ran four miles in a total of 20 minutes. To find the average time it took him to run a mile, we divide the total time by the number of miles: 20 / 4 = 5 So Colin's average time to run a mile was 5 minutes. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Jill can run up a hill at 9 feet/second and down a hill at 12 feet/second. How long does it take her to run up and down a 900 foot hill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for Jill to run up the hill. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed The distance she runs up the hill is 900 feet, and her speed is 9 feet/second. So: time up = 900 / 9 = 100 seconds Next, we need to find the time it takes for Jill to run down the hill. Again, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed The distance she runs down the hill is also 900 feet, but her speed is 12 feet/second. So: time down = 900 / 12 = 75 seconds Finally, we need to find the total time it takes for Jill to run up and down the hill. Since she runs up and down separately, we can just add the two times: total time = time up + time down = 100 + 75 = 175 seconds Therefore, it takes Jill 175 seconds to run up and down a 900 foot hill. The answer is 900.\n\n\nQ: Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour. Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour.  Oliver can read 40 pages.  How many pages can Carter read in 1 hour?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Oliver can read 40 pages in 1 hour. Next, we know that Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour, so Lucy can read 40 + 20 = 60 pages in 1 hour. Finally, we know that Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour, so Carter can read 60 / 2 = 30 pages in 1 hour. Therefore, Carter can read 30 pages in 1 hour. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: A train takes 4 hours to reach a destination at a speed of 50 miles per hour. How long would it take if it traveled at 100 miles per hour instead?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time We know that the distance is the same in both scenarios, so we can set the two equations equal to each other: 50 miles/hour x 4 hours = 100 miles/hour x time Simplifying this equation, we get: 200 miles = 100 miles/hour x time Dividing both sides by 100 miles/hour, we get: time = 2 hours Therefore, if the train traveled at 100 miles per hour instead of 50 miles per hour, it would take 2 hours to reach the destination. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Xena is trying to outrun a dragon to get to the safety of a cave it's too big to fit into. Xena has a 600 foot head start, but the dragon can burn her if it gets within 120 feet of her. If Xena runs 15 feet per second and the dragon flies 30 feet per second, how many seconds does Xena have to get to the cave?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how fast the dragon can catch up to Xena. The dragon can cover 30 - 15 = 15 feet per second faster than Xena. Next, we need to find out how far the dragon needs to travel to catch up to Xena. This distance is 600 - 120 = 480 feet. Finally, we can use the formula distance = rate x time to find out how long Xena has to get to the cave. We can set up the equation as follows: 480 = 15t + 30t Simplifying the equation, we get: 480 = 45t Dividing both sides by 45, we get: t = 10.67 seconds Therefore, Xena has 10.67 seconds to get to the cave before the dragon catches up to her. The answer is 11.\n\n\n"
