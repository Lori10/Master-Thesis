  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Jamie and Oliver are planning to go on a vacation. A plane ticket costs $24 for each person and a hotel stay costs $12 for each person per day. How much money will they spend on the vacation if they stay for 3 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets for both Jamie and Oliver. Since each ticket costs $24, the total cost of the tickets will be: $24 x 2 = $48 Next, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel stay. Since the cost is $12 per person per day, and they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel stay will be: $12 x 2 x 3 = $72 Finally, we need to add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay to get the total cost of the vacation: $48 + $72 = $120 Therefore, Jamie and Oliver will spend $120 on their vacation. The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: Ayla has a customer care job whose primary role is to hear complaints from customers and advise them on the best way to solve their problems. She talks with each customer for a limited amount of time, and each phone call is charged five cents per minute. If each call lasts 1 hour, what's the phone bill at the end of the month if she manages to talk to 50 customers a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many minutes are in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, each call lasts 60 minutes. Next, we need to find out how many minutes Ayla spends on the phone each week. If she talks to 50 customers a week, and each call lasts 60 minutes, then she spends 50 x 60 = 3000 minutes on the phone each week. Now we can calculate the cost of the phone bill. Each minute costs five cents, so 3000 minutes will cost 3000 x $0.05 = $150. Therefore, the phone bill at the end of the month will be $150 x 4 = $600 if Ayla manages to talk to 50 customers a week. The answer is 50.\n\n\nQ: Mark loves to see shows in theaters. He decided to visit the theater at least once a week. One performance lasts 3 hours. The price of the ticket depends on the time spent in the theater and stands at $5 for each hour. How much will Mark spend on visits to the theater in 6 weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many performances Mark will attend in 6 weeks. Since he wants to visit the theater at least once a week, we can multiply the number of weeks by 1: 6 weeks x 1 performance per week = 6 performances Next, we need to calculate the cost of each performance. We know that one performance lasts 3 hours, so the cost of one performance will be: 3 hours x $5 per hour = $15 Finally, we can calculate the total cost of all 6 performances by multiplying the cost of one performance by the number of performances: $15 per performance x 6 performances = $90 Therefore, Mark will spend $90 on visits to the theater in 6 weeks. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Twenty people pre-bought plane tickets at a price of $155 per ticket. Thirty people bought their plane tickets at the gate and they each paid $200 for their ticket. How many more dollars did the people at the gate pay for their tickets than those passengers that pre-bought their tickets?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total cost of pre-bought tickets Twenty people pre-bought tickets at $155 per ticket, so the total cost is: 20 x $155 = $3100 Step 2: Find the total cost of tickets bought at the gate Thirty people bought tickets at $200 per ticket, so the total cost is: 30 x $200 = $6000 Step 3: Find the difference in cost between the two groups To find the difference, we subtract the total cost of pre-bought tickets from the total cost of tickets bought at the gate: $6000 - $3100 = $2900 Therefore, the people at the gate paid $2900 more for their tickets than those passengers that pre-bought their tickets. The answer is 2900.\n\n\nQ: Samuel is going to the cinema with his brother, Kevin. They both have a total budget of $20 for their outing. Samuel buys his $14 ticket, then spends $6 on drinks and food. Kevin buys his ticket, then spends $2 on drinks. They have both used their entire budget. How much did Kevin spend on food?\nA: Let's think step by step. Samuel spent $14 on his ticket and $6 on food and drinks, which means he spent a total of $20. This means that Kevin must have spent $0 on food and drinks, since they both used their entire budget of $20. Therefore, Kevin spent $6 on his ticket and $2 on drinks, which means he spent a total of $8. Since he didn't spend any money on food, the answer is $0. The answer is 0.\n\n\nQ: Doris earns $20 per hour by babysitting. She needs to earn at least $1200 for her monthly expenses. She can babysit for 3 hours every weekday and 5 hours on a Saturday.  How many weeks does it take for Doris to earn enough to cover her monthly expenses?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much Doris earns per week by babysitting. She babysits for 3 hours every weekday, which is a total of 15 hours per week (3 hours x 5 days). She also babysits for 5 hours on a Saturday, which adds another 5 hours to her weekly total. So, in total, she babysits for 20 hours per week. If she earns $20 per hour, then she earns 20 x 20 = $400 per week. To cover her monthly expenses of $1200, she needs to earn 1200 / 400 = 3 weeks of babysitting. Therefore, it takes Doris 3 weeks to earn enough to cover her monthly expenses. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: To get to an island called \"Virgo\", Tom needs to travel by plane and then by boat. The plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, and the boat trip takes up to 2 hours. In how many hours is Tom able to get to the \"Virgo\" island?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long the plane trip is. We know that the plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, so we can set up an equation: plane trip = 4 * boat trip Since we know the boat trip takes 2 hours, we can substitute that in: plane trip = 4 * 2 plane trip = 8 So the plane trip is 8 hours. Now we just need to add the plane trip and the boat trip together to find the total time: total time = plane trip + boat trip total time = 8 + 2 total time = 10 So Tom is able to get to the \"Virgo\" island in 10 hours. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Emery's family decides to travel for a weekend trip. They drive the first 100 miles in 1 hour. They stop at a McDonald's and then continue the rest of the journey for 300 miles. What's the total number of hours they traveled?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, they drove 100 miles in 1 hour. Then, they stopped at McDonald's, which we don't know how long it took. Finally, they continued the rest of the journey for 300 miles. So, the total distance they traveled is 100 + 300 = 400 miles. We know they drove the first 100 miles in 1 hour, but we don't know how long they stopped at McDonald's. Let's call that time \"x\". Then, they drove the remaining 300 miles. Let's call the time it took to drive that distance \"y\". So, the total time they traveled is: 1 hour (for the first 100 miles) + x (for the time they stopped at McDonald's) + y (for the remaining 300 miles) We don't know x or y, but we do know that the total time they traveled is the sum of those three values. Therefore, the answer is: Total time = 1 + x + y hours. The answer is 1.\n\n\n"
