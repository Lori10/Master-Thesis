  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Tom turned 32 years old 5 years ago.  7 years ago Jim was 5 years older than half Tom's age.  How old is Jim in 2 years?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find Tom's current age. We know that he turned 32 years old 5 years ago, so we can add 32 and 5 to get his current age: Tom's current age = 32 + 5 = 37 Next, we need to figure out how old Jim was 7 years ago. We know that 7 years ago, Jim was 5 years older than half of Tom's age. Half of Tom's age is: 37 / 2 = 18.5 So 7 years ago, Jim was: 18.5 + 5 = 23.5 Now we need to find Jim's current age. We know that 7 years have passed since we calculated Jim's age, so we need to add 7 to his age: Jim's current age = 23.5 + 7 = 30.5 Finally, we need to find Jim's age in 2 years. We can simply add 2 to his current age: Jim's age in 2 years = 30.5 + 2 = 32.5 Therefore, Jim will be 32.5 years old in 2 years. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Karina was born in 1970 and she is currently twice as old as her brother. If her current age is 40, in what year was her brother born?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Karina's current age is 40. We also know that she is currently twice as old as her brother. Therefore, we can set up an equation: 40 = 2x where x is her brother's current age. Solving for x, we get: x = 20 So Karina's brother is currently 20 years old. Next, we need to figure out in what year he was born. We know that Karina was born in 1970, so we can subtract her brother's age from that year: 1970 - 20 = 1950 Therefore, Karina's brother was born in 1950. The answer is 1950.\n\n\nQ: 9 years from now, John will be 3 times as old as he was 11 years ago. How old is he now?\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume John's current age is x. 11 years ago, John's age was x - 11. 9 years from now, John's age will be x + 9. According to the problem, 9 years from now, John will be 3 times as old as he was 11 years ago. So, we can write the equation: x + 9 = 3(x - 11) Now, we can solve for x: x + 9 = 3x - 33 42 = 2x x = 21 Therefore, John is currently 21 years old. The answer is 21.\n\n\nQ: Darcie is 4 years old. She is 1/6 as old as her mother and her mother is 4/5 as old as her father. How old is her father?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can use algebra to represent Darcie's mother's age in terms of Darcie's age. Let's call Darcie's mother's age \"M\". We know that Darcie is 1/6 as old as her mother, so we can write: Darcie's age = 1/6 x Darcie's mother's age 4 = 1/6M Next, we can use algebra to represent Darcie's father's age in terms of Darcie's mother's age. Let's call Darcie's father's age \"F\". We know that Darcie's mother is 4/5 as old as her father, so we can write: Darcie's mother's age = 4/5 x Darcie's father's age M = 4/5F Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for F: 4 = 1/6M 4 = 1/6(4/5F) 4 = 2/15F F = 30 Therefore, Darcie's father is 30 years old. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: Four classmates were comparing their ages based on their birth month. They found out that Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese while Therese is 5 months older than Aivo. Then, Leon is 2 months older than Aivo. How much older in months is Jolyn than Leon?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine the age difference between Aivo and Therese. We know that Therese is 5 months older than Aivo. Next, we need to determine the age difference between Jolyn and Therese. We know that Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese. Then, we need to determine the age difference between Leon and Aivo. We know that Leon is 2 months older than Aivo. To find the age difference between Jolyn and Leon, we need to add up the age differences between Jolyn and Therese, Therese and Aivo, and Aivo and Leon. (2 months + 5 months + 2 months) = 9 months Therefore, Jolyn is 9 months older than Leon. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Miriam currently has 30 marbles, but she used to have more. Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, gave her sister twice that amount and gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has. How many marbles did Miriam start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, so she now has 30 - 60 = -30 marbles. This doesn't make sense, so we know that Miriam must have started with more than 60 marbles. Next, we know that Miriam gave her sister twice the amount she gave her brother, so her sister received 2 * 60 = 120 marbles. We also know that Miriam gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has, so Savanna received 3 * 30 = 90 marbles. In total, Miriam gave away 60 + 120 + 90 = 270 marbles. If Miriam started with x marbles, we can set up the equation: x - 270 = 30 Solving for x, we get: x = 300 Therefore, Miriam started with 300 marbles. The answer is 300.\n\n\nQ: Sally, Sam, and Steve went to play with their marbles. In the beginning, Sam has twice as many marbles as Steve while Sally has 5 less than Sam. After Sam has given Sally and Steve 3 marbles each, Sam has 8 marbles left. How many marbles does Steve have now?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Sam had in the beginning. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve, so let's call the number of marbles Steve had \"x\". This means that Sam had 2x marbles. Next, we know that Sally had 5 less marbles than Sam, so Sally had 2x - 5 marbles. After Sam gave 3 marbles each to Sally and Steve, he was left with 8 marbles. This means that he gave away a total of 6 marbles (3 to Sally and 3 to Steve), so he must have started with 14 marbles (8 + 6 = 14). Now we can use this information to figure out how many marbles Steve has. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve in the beginning, so if Sam had 14 marbles, Steve must have had 7 marbles (14 \u00f7 2 = 7). After Sam gave Steve 3 marbles, Steve now has 10 marbles (7 + 3 = 10). The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Yvonne swims 10 laps in 5 minutes.  Her younger sister can swim half as many laps as Yvonne in the same time frame.  Their brother Joel can swim three times the number of laps as the youngest sister.  How many laps can Joel swim?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many laps Yvonne's younger sister can swim in 5 minutes. Since she can swim half as many laps as Yvonne, we can divide Yvonne's number of laps by 2: Yvonne's sister = 10 laps / 2 = 5 laps Next, we need to figure out how many laps Joel can swim. We know that he can swim three times the number of laps as the youngest sister, so we can multiply her number of laps by 3: Joel = 5 laps * 3 = 15 laps Therefore, Joel can swim 15 laps in 5 minutes. The answer is 5.\n\n\n"
