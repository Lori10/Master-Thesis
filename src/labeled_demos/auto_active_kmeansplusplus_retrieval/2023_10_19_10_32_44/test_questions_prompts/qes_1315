  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A tomato plant has 100 tomatoes. Jane picks 1/4 of that number for use in their house. After a week, she goes back and picks 20 more tomatoes, and the following week picks twice that number. What's the total number of fruits remaining on the tomato plant?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Jane picks 1/4 of 100 tomatoes, which is 25 tomatoes. So, there are 100 - 25 = 75 tomatoes left on the plant. After a week, Jane picks 20 more tomatoes, so there are 75 - 20 = 55 tomatoes left on the plant. The following week, Jane picks twice the number of tomatoes she picked the previous week, which is 2 * 20 = 40 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes Jane picked is 25 + 20 + 40 = 85 tomatoes. The total number of tomatoes remaining on the plant is 100 - 85 = 15 tomatoes. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: A total of 107 oranges are picked by Del and Juan. Del picked 23 on each of 2 days and Juan picked the rest. How many oranges did Juan pick?\nA: Let's think step by step. Del picked 23 oranges on each of 2 days, so he picked a total of 23 x 2 = 46 oranges. If the total number of oranges picked by both Del and Juan is 107, then Juan picked 107 - 46 = 61 oranges. Therefore, Juan picked 61 oranges. The answer is 61.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: Betty and Dora started making some cupcakes at the same time. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour and Dora makes 8 every hour. If Betty took a two-hour break, what is the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Betty made in the first 3 hours before taking a break. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour, so in 3 hours, she would make: 10 cupcakes/hour x 3 hours = 30 cupcakes Next, we need to find out how many cupcakes Dora made in the same 5 hours. Dora makes 8 cupcakes every hour, so in 5 hours, she would make: 8 cupcakes/hour x 5 hours = 40 cupcakes Now we need to find the difference between the number of cupcakes they made. Betty made 30 cupcakes before taking a break, and Dora made 40 cupcakes in the same 5 hours. So the difference between the number of cupcakes they made is: 40 cupcakes - 30 cupcakes = 10 cupcakes Therefore, the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours is 10 cupcakes. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Stella and Twinkle are filling up a truck with a capacity of 6000 stone blocks at the rate of 250 blocks per hour per person. They work for four hours and are then joined by 6 other people who also work at the same rate. How many hours did filling the truck take?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many blocks Stella and Twinkle can fill in 4 hours. 250 blocks per hour per person x 2 people x 4 hours = 2000 blocks So, after 4 hours, Stella and Twinkle have filled 2000 blocks. Next, we need to find out how many blocks all 8 people can fill in one hour. 250 blocks per hour per person x 8 people = 2000 blocks So, all 8 people can fill 2000 blocks in one hour. Now, we need to find out how many more blocks they need to fill to reach the capacity of 6000 blocks. 6000 blocks - 2000 blocks = 4000 blocks Finally, we can use the rate of 2000 blocks per hour for all 8 people to find out how many hours it will take to fill the remaining 4000 blocks. 4000 blocks \u00f7 2000 blocks per hour = 2 hours Therefore, filling the truck took a total of 4 + 2 = 6 hours. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Jeremy buys 30 watermelons. He eats 3 watermelons per week. Each week he gives 2 to his dad. How many weeks will the watermelons last?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many watermelons Jeremy eats per week and how many he gives to his dad. Jeremy eats 3 watermelons per week and gives 2 to his dad, so he uses a total of 5 watermelons per week. Next, we need to divide the total number of watermelons by the number of watermelons used per week to find out how many weeks the watermelons will last. 30 watermelons \u00f7 5 watermelons per week = 6 weeks Therefore, the watermelons will last for 6 weeks. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Tania has five baskets containing a total of 58 fruits. There are 18 mangoes in one basket, 10 pears in another, 12 pawpaws in another and the last 2 contain the same number of kiwi and lemon respectively, how many lemons are there?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of fruits in the three baskets that are not kiwi or lemon. 18 + 10 + 12 = 40 So, there are 40 fruits in those three baskets. Next, we need to find the total number of fruits in all five baskets. If there are 58 fruits in total, and 40 of them are in the three baskets we just added up, then the remaining two baskets must contain: 58 - 40 = 18 fruits We know that one of those baskets contains kiwi and the other contains lemon, and they have the same number of fruits. So, we can divide the remaining 18 fruits by 2 to get: 18 / 2 = 9 Therefore, there are 9 lemons in the basket with lemon. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Last night Kannon had 3 apples, a banana, and 4 oranges for dinner. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, and twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today. How many fruits would she have eaten so far in the two meals?\nA: Let's think step by step. Last night Kannon had 3 apples, 1 banana, and 4 oranges, so she had a total of 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 fruits. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, which means she will have 3 + 4 = 7 apples today. She is also planning to have 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, which means she will have 1 x 10 = 10 bananas today. Finally, she is planning to have twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today, which means she will have 7 x 2 = 14 oranges today. Therefore, in total, Kannon will have eaten 7 + 10 + 14 = 31 fruits in the two meals. The answer is 31.\n\n\n"
