  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Bingo has two dogs. On average, they walk a total of 70 miles a week. The first dog walks an average of 2 miles a day. How many miles a day does the other dog average?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many miles the first dog walks in a week. We can do this by multiplying the number of miles the dog walks in a day by the number of days in a week: 2 miles/day x 7 days/week = 14 miles/week Now we can find out how many miles the second dog walks in a week by subtracting the first dog's weekly distance from the total weekly distance: 70 miles/week - 14 miles/week = 56 miles/week Finally, we can find out how many miles the second dog walks in a day by dividing its weekly distance by the number of days in a week: 56 miles/week \u00f7 7 days/week = 8 miles/day Therefore, the second dog averages 8 miles a day. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Alani earned $45 for 3 hours of baby-sitting. At the same rate, for how many hours would she need to baby-sit to earn $75?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much Alani earns per hour of baby-sitting. To do this, we can divide the total amount she earned by the number of hours she worked: $45 \u00f7 3 hours = $15 per hour Now that we know Alani earns $15 per hour of baby-sitting, we can use this rate to figure out how many hours she would need to work to earn $75. We can set up a proportion: $15 per hour = $75 \u00f7 x hours To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: $15x = $75 Then, we can divide both sides by 15: x = 5 hours Therefore, Alani would need to baby-sit for 5 hours to earn $75 at the same rate. The answer is 75.\n\n\nQ: Doris earns $20 per hour by babysitting. She needs to earn at least $1200 for her monthly expenses. She can babysit for 3 hours every weekday and 5 hours on a Saturday.  How many weeks does it take for Doris to earn enough to cover her monthly expenses?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much Doris earns per week by babysitting. She babysits for 3 hours every weekday, which is a total of 15 hours per week (3 hours x 5 days). She also babysits for 5 hours on a Saturday, which adds another 5 hours to her weekly total. So, in total, she babysits for 20 hours per week. If she earns $20 per hour, then she earns 20 x 20 = $400 per week. To cover her monthly expenses of $1200, she needs to earn 1200 / 400 = 3 weeks of babysitting. Therefore, it takes Doris 3 weeks to earn enough to cover her monthly expenses. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Every Monday to Friday morning, Alice walks 10 miles through a large grass field to get to school. To avoid the hot afternoon sun on her way home, she walks 12 miles through a forest. When she gets home on Friday, how many miles will she have walked that week?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. Alice walks 10 miles every morning from Monday to Friday. So, in total, she walks 10 x 5 = 50 miles during the weekdays. On her way back home, she walks 12 miles every afternoon from Monday to Friday. So, in total, she walks 12 x 5 = 60 miles during the weekdays. Therefore, the total distance Alice walks during the weekdays is 50 + 60 = 110 miles. Since the problem asks for the total distance Alice walks in a week, we need to add the distance she walks on Saturday and Sunday as well. Let's assume Alice doesn't walk to school on weekends. So, the total distance she walks on weekends is 0. Therefore, the total distance Alice walks in a week is 110 + 0 + 0 = 110 miles. The answer is 110.\n\n\nQ: Christina and her friend are driving across the state. When Christina is driving the speed limit is 30 miles per hour. When her friend is driving, the speed limit is 40 miles per hour. The drive is 210 miles total. If her friend drives for 3 hours and both drive at the speed limit, how many minutes will Christina drive?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long Christina's friend will drive for. We know that her friend will drive for 3 hours at 40 miles per hour, so we can use the formula: distance = rate x time to find out how far her friend will travel: distance = 40 x 3 = 120 miles Now we can subtract that distance from the total distance to find out how far Christina will drive: 210 - 120 = 90 miles We also know that Christina drives at 30 miles per hour, so we can use the formula again to find out how long she will drive for: time = distance / rate time = 90 / 30 = 3 hours But we need to convert that to minutes, so we can multiply by 60: time = 3 x 60 = 180 minutes So Christina will drive for 180 minutes. The answer is 180.\n\n\nQ: Eliana walked 200 steps for her morning exercise, did some press-ups, then added some 300 more steps to her count for the first day. The next day, she walked twice the number of steps she walked on the first day.  And on the third day, Eliana walked an additional 100 steps. What's the total number of steps Eliana walked during these three days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Eliana walked 200 + 300 = 500 steps. On the second day, she walked twice the number of steps she walked on the first day, which is 2 * 500 = 1000 steps. On the third day, she walked an additional 100 steps. Therefore, the total number of steps Eliana walked during these three days is 500 + 1000 + 100 = 1600 steps. The answer is 1600.\n\n\nQ: Ayen jogs for 30 minutes every day during weekdays. This week on Tuesday, she jogged 5 minutes more and also jogged 25 minutes more on Friday. How many hours, in total, did Ayen jog this week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long Ayen jogged on each weekday. She jogs for 30 minutes every day during weekdays, so from Monday to Thursday, she jogged for a total of 30 x 4 = 120 minutes. On Tuesday, she jogged 5 minutes more, so she jogged for 30 + 5 = 35 minutes. On Friday, she jogged 25 minutes more, so she jogged for 30 + 25 = 55 minutes. Therefore, Ayen jogged for a total of 120 + 35 + 55 = 210 minutes this week. To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 210 \u00f7 60 = 3.5 hours So Ayen jogged for a total of 3.5 hours this week. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\n"
