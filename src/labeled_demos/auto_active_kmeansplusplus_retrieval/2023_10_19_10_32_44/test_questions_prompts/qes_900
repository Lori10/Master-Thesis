  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Merry had 50 boxes of apples on Saturday and 25 boxes on Sunday. There were 10 apples in each box. If she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, how many boxes of apples are left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many apples Merry had in total. On Saturday, she had 50 boxes of apples, and each box had 10 apples, so she had 50 x 10 = 500 apples on Saturday. On Sunday, she had 25 boxes of apples, and each box had 10 apples, so she had 25 x 10 = 250 apples on Sunday. In total, she had 500 + 250 = 750 apples. Next, we need to find out how many apples she sold. We know that she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, so she must have had 750 - 720 = 30 apples left. Finally, we need to find out how many boxes of apples she has left. We know that there are 10 apples in each box, so she must have 30 / 10 = 3 boxes of apples left. Therefore, Merry has 3 boxes of apples left. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Carl has a goal of selling 96 cupcakes in 2 days. Carl needs to give 24 cupcakes to Bonnie as payment for using her storefront. How many cupcakes must Carl sell per day to reach his goal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to subtract the 24 cupcakes that Carl needs to give to Bonnie from his goal of selling 96 cupcakes. 96 - 24 = 72 So Carl needs to sell 72 cupcakes in 2 days. To find out how many cupcakes he needs to sell per day, we can divide 72 by 2: 72 \u00f7 2 = 36 Therefore, Carl needs to sell 36 cupcakes per day to reach his goal of selling 96 cupcakes in 2 days, after giving 24 cupcakes to Bonnie. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Shane prepares sandwiches for the Boy Scouts. He buys 2 packages of sliced bread containing 20 slices each, and he also buys 2 packages of sliced ham containing 8 slices each. Shane will make as many sandwiches as he can according to the ham he has. How many slices of bread will he have leftover?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of ham Shane has in total. 2 packages of sliced ham containing 8 slices each = 2 x 8 = 16 slices of ham Now, we know that Shane will make as many sandwiches as he can according to the ham he has. Since each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread, we can calculate the maximum number of sandwiches he can make: 16 slices of ham / 2 slices of bread per sandwich = 8 sandwiches So, Shane will make 8 sandwiches. Each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread, so he will use: 8 sandwiches x 2 slices of bread per sandwich = 16 slices of bread Shane has 2 packages of sliced bread containing 20 slices each, so he has: 2 packages x 20 slices per package = 40 slices of bread Therefore, he will have: 40 slices of bread - 16 slices of bread used = 24 slices of bread leftover. So, Shane will have 24 slices of bread leftover. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: On Friday, Hank opened his used-bicycle store with a stock of bicycles, all fixed-up and ready to ride. Over the course of the day, he sold 10 bicycles and bought an additional 15 to fix up. On Saturday, he sold 12 bicycles and bought 8 more. And on Sunday, he sold 9 bicycles and bought 11 more. What was the net increase in the number of bicycles in stock in Hank's store over the three days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On Friday, Hank sold 10 bicycles and bought 15 more, so the net increase in the number of bicycles in stock was 15 - 10 = 5. On Saturday, he sold 12 bicycles and bought 8 more, so the net decrease in the number of bicycles in stock was 12 - 8 = 4. On Sunday, he sold 9 bicycles and bought 11 more, so the net increase in the number of bicycles in stock was 11 - 9 = 2. To find the overall net increase in the number of bicycles in stock over the three days, we need to add up the net increases and net decreases: Net increase on Friday = 5 Net decrease on Saturday = -4 Net increase on Sunday = 2 Overall net increase = 5 - 4 + 2 = 3 Therefore, the net increase in the number of bicycles in stock in Hank's store over the three days was 3. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: The bakery makes 3 batches of baguettes a day.  Each batch has 48 baguettes.  After the first batch came out, he sold 37.  After the second batch, he sold 52.  After the third batch he sold 49.  How many baguettes are left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many baguettes were made in total. 3 batches x 48 baguettes per batch = 144 baguettes Next, we need to subtract the number of baguettes sold after each batch. After the first batch: 144 - 37 = 107 baguettes left After the second batch: 107 - 52 = 55 baguettes left After the third batch: 55 - 49 = 6 baguettes left Therefore, there are 6 baguettes left after all three batches were made and sold. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: There are four members in one household. Each member consumes 3 slices of bread during breakfast and 2 slices of bread for snacks. A loaf of bread has 12 slices. How many days will five loaves of bread last in this family?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of bread each member consumes per day. For breakfast, each member consumes 3 slices of bread. For snacks, each member consumes 2 slices of bread. So, in total, each member consumes 3 + 2 = 5 slices of bread per day. Since there are four members in the household, the total number of slices of bread consumed per day is 4 x 5 = 20 slices. Now, we need to find out how many days five loaves of bread will last. One loaf of bread has 12 slices, so five loaves of bread have 5 x 12 = 60 slices. If the family consumes 20 slices of bread per day, then 60 slices will last for 60/20 = 3 days. Therefore, five loaves of bread will last for 3 days in this family. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Colby harvested his mango trees, the total mangoes he harvested is 60 kilograms. He sold 20 kilograms to the market and sold the remaining half to his community. If each kilogram contains 8 mangoes, how many mangoes does he still have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many kilograms of mangoes Colby sold to his community. We know that he sold 20 kilograms to the market, so he had 60 - 20 = 40 kilograms left. Next, we need to find out how many kilograms of mangoes he sold to his community. We know that he sold half of the remaining 40 kilograms, which is 40/2 = 20 kilograms. Finally, we need to find out how many mangoes he still has. We know that each kilogram contains 8 mangoes, so he sold a total of 20 + 20 = 40 kilograms, which is equivalent to 40 x 8 = 320 mangoes. Therefore, Colby still has 60 - 40 = 20 kilograms of mangoes, which is equivalent to 20 x 8 = 160 mangoes. The answer is 160.\n\n\nQ: Every Monday to Friday morning, Alice walks 10 miles through a large grass field to get to school. To avoid the hot afternoon sun on her way home, she walks 12 miles through a forest. When she gets home on Friday, how many miles will she have walked that week?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. Alice walks 10 miles every morning from Monday to Friday. So, in total, she walks 10 x 5 = 50 miles during the weekdays. On her way back home, she walks 12 miles every afternoon from Monday to Friday. So, in total, she walks 12 x 5 = 60 miles during the weekdays. Therefore, the total distance Alice walks during the weekdays is 50 + 60 = 110 miles. Since the problem asks for the total distance Alice walks in a week, we need to add the distance she walks on Saturday and Sunday as well. Let's assume Alice doesn't walk to school on weekends. So, the total distance she walks on weekends is 0. Therefore, the total distance Alice walks in a week is 110 + 0 + 0 = 110 miles. The answer is 110.\n\n\n"
