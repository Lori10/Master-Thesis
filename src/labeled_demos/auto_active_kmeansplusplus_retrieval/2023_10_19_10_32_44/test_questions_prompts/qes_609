  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A tomato plant has 100 tomatoes. Jane picks 1/4 of that number for use in their house. After a week, she goes back and picks 20 more tomatoes, and the following week picks twice that number. What's the total number of fruits remaining on the tomato plant?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Jane picks 1/4 of 100 tomatoes, which is 25 tomatoes. So, there are 100 - 25 = 75 tomatoes left on the plant. After a week, Jane picks 20 more tomatoes, so there are 75 - 20 = 55 tomatoes left on the plant. The following week, Jane picks twice the number of tomatoes she picked the previous week, which is 2 * 20 = 40 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes Jane picked is 25 + 20 + 40 = 85 tomatoes. The total number of tomatoes remaining on the plant is 100 - 85 = 15 tomatoes. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: James has a small tree outside his window with 30 branches with 90 twigs per branch. 30% of the twigs sprout 4 leaves and the rest sprout 5 leaves. How many leaves are on the tree total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of twigs on the tree. We know that there are 30 branches with 90 twigs per branch, so: 30 branches x 90 twigs per branch = 2700 twigs Next, we need to find how many twigs sprout 4 leaves and how many sprout 5 leaves. We know that 30% of the twigs sprout 4 leaves, so: 30% of 2700 twigs = 0.3 x 2700 = 810 twigs sprout 4 leaves The remaining twigs sprout 5 leaves: 2700 twigs - 810 twigs = 1890 twigs sprout 5 leaves Now we can find the total number of leaves on the tree. Each twig that sprouts 4 leaves contributes 4 leaves, and each twig that sprouts 5 leaves contributes 5 leaves. So: 810 twigs x 4 leaves per twig = 3240 leaves from twigs that sprout 4 leaves 1890 twigs x 5 leaves per twig = 9450 leaves from twigs that sprout 5 leaves The total number of leaves on the tree is: 3240 leaves + 9450 leaves = 12690 leaves Therefore, there are 12690 leaves on the tree in total. The answer is 12690.\n\n\nQ: James and 4 of his friends volunteered to plant flowers. In 2 days, they were able to plant a total of 200 flowers. If each of them planted the same number of flowers, how many flowers did James plant in a day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people were planting flowers. We know that James and 4 of his friends volunteered, so there were 5 people in total. Next, we need to find out how many flowers each person planted in 2 days. To do this, we can divide the total number of flowers planted (200) by the number of people (5) and the number of days (2): 200 \u00f7 5 \u00f7 2 = 20 So each person planted 20 flowers in 2 days. Finally, we need to find out how many flowers James planted in 1 day. Since each person planted 20 flowers in 2 days, we can divide that by 2 to find out how many flowers each person planted in 1 day: 20 \u00f7 2 = 10 Therefore, James planted 10 flowers in 1 day. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: There are 10 bags with 30 oranges each on a truck. A total of 50 pieces of oranges are rotten. Thirty pieces of oranges will be kept for making orange juice and the rest will be sold. How many pieces of oranges will be sold?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of oranges in the 10 bags. 10 bags x 30 oranges/bag = 300 oranges Next, we need to subtract the number of rotten oranges. 300 oranges - 50 rotten oranges = 250 good oranges Now, we know that 30 oranges will be kept for making juice. 250 good oranges - 30 oranges for juice = 220 oranges to be sold Therefore, 220 pieces of oranges will be sold. The answer is 220.\n\n\nQ: Anna wants to plant red and yellow tulips in the shape of a smiley face. She needs 8 red tulips for each eye and 18 red tulips for the smile. If she needs 9 times the number of tulips in the smile to make the yellow background of the face, how many tulips does she need total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many red tulips Anna needs in total. She needs 8 red tulips for each eye, so for both eyes, she needs 8 x 2 = 16 red tulips. She also needs 18 red tulips for the smile. Therefore, she needs a total of 16 + 18 = 34 red tulips. Next, we need to figure out how many yellow tulips Anna needs. We know that she needs 9 times the number of tulips in the smile to make the yellow background of the face. Since she needs 18 red tulips for the smile, she needs 9 x 18 = 162 yellow tulips. Finally, we can add the number of red and yellow tulips together to find the total number of tulips Anna needs. She needs 34 red tulips and 162 yellow tulips, so she needs a total of 34 + 162 = 196 tulips in total. The answer is 196.\n\n\nQ: A park has three colors of flowering crepe myrtle trees planted: red, white, and pink. When they bloom, a third of them are pink, but only two are red. Most of them are white. There are 42 crepe myrtle trees in the park. How many have white flowers when they bloom?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that a third of the trees are pink. So, we can find the number of pink trees by dividing the total number of trees by 3: 42 \u00f7 3 = 14 So, there are 14 pink trees in the park. Next, we know that only two trees are red. So, we can subtract those from the total number of trees to find the number of white trees: 42 - 14 - 2 = 26 Therefore, there are 26 crepe myrtle trees with white flowers when they bloom. The answer is 26.\n\n\nQ: A flower shop sells bouquets of roses, which each contain 12 roses, and bouquets of daisies, which each contain an equal amount of daisies. The flower shop sells 20 bouquets today. 10 of these were rose bouquets and the remaining 10 bouquets were daisy bouquets. If the flower shop has sold 190 flowers in total today, how many daisies are in each bouquet of daisies?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the flower shop sold 10 bouquets of roses, each containing 12 roses, so they sold a total of 10 x 12 = 120 roses. Next, we know that the flower shop sold 10 bouquets of daisies, and we want to find out how many daisies are in each bouquet. Let's call the number of daisies in each bouquet \"d\". So, the flower shop sold a total of 10 x d = 10d daisies. We also know that the flower shop sold a total of 190 flowers in total today, so: 120 (roses) + 10d (daisies) = 190 Simplifying this equation, we get: 10d = 70 Dividing both sides by 10, we get: d = 7 Therefore, each bouquet of daisies contains 7 daisies. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Jaylen has 5 carrots and 2 cucumbers. Jaylen has twice as many bell peppers as Kristin. Jaylen has 3 less than half as many green beans as Kristin. If Kristin has 2 bell peppers and 20 green beans, how many vegetables does Jaylen have in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bell peppers Jaylen has. We know that Jaylen has twice as many bell peppers as Kristin, and Kristin has 2 bell peppers. So, Jaylen has 2 x 2 = 4 bell peppers. Next, we need to find out how many green beans Jaylen has. We know that Jaylen has 3 less than half as many green beans as Kristin, and Kristin has 20 green beans. So, half of 20 is 10, and 3 less than 10 is 7. Therefore, Jaylen has 7 green beans. Now, we can add up all the vegetables Jaylen has: 5 carrots + 2 cucumbers + 4 bell peppers + 7 green beans = 18 vegetables in total. The answer is 18.\n\n\n"
