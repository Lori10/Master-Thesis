  "test_question": "Q: Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours. If they worked for 12 hours in a day, calculate the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together.",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Betty and Dora started making some cupcakes at the same time. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour and Dora makes 8 every hour. If Betty took a two-hour break, what is the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Betty made in the first 3 hours before taking a break. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour, so in 3 hours, she would make: 10 cupcakes/hour x 3 hours = 30 cupcakes Next, we need to find out how many cupcakes Dora made in the same 5 hours. Dora makes 8 cupcakes every hour, so in 5 hours, she would make: 8 cupcakes/hour x 5 hours = 40 cupcakes Now we need to find the difference between the number of cupcakes they made. Betty made 30 cupcakes before taking a break, and Dora made 40 cupcakes in the same 5 hours. So the difference between the number of cupcakes they made is: 40 cupcakes - 30 cupcakes = 10 cupcakes Therefore, the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours is 10 cupcakes. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Mary wants 144 cupcakes for her party. Mary has already made 36 cherry cupcakes, and 48 berry cupcakes. Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes for the rest. How much of each should she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Mary has already made: 36 cherry + 48 berry = 84 cupcakes Next, we need to figure out how many more cupcakes Mary needs to make: 144 total cupcakes - 84 cupcakes already made = 60 cupcakes Since Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, we can divide the remaining 60 cupcakes by 2: 60 cupcakes \u00f7 2 = 30 cupcakes of each flavor Therefore, Mary should make 30 chocolate cupcakes and 30 vanilla cupcakes to have a total of 144 cupcakes for her party. The answer is 144.\n\n\nQ: A cake of 400 grams is divided into eight equal parts. Nathalie eats one-eighth of the cake, and Pierre eats double what Nathalie ate. How much did Pierre eat, in grams?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much one-eighth of the cake weighs. We can do this by dividing the weight of the cake (400 grams) by 8: 400 \u00f7 8 = 50 So one-eighth of the cake weighs 50 grams. Next, we need to find out how much Pierre ate, which is double what Nathalie ate. We can do this by multiplying Nathalie's portion (50 grams) by 2: 50 \u00d7 2 = 100 Therefore, Pierre ate 100 grams of the cake. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: Valerie\u2019s cookie recipe makes 16 dozen cookies and calls for 4 pounds of butter.  She only wants to make 4 dozen cookies for the weekend.  How many pounds of butter will she need?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cookies Valerie needs to make for the weekend. Since she only wants to make 4 dozen cookies, we can calculate that as: 4 dozen cookies = 4 x 12 = 48 cookies Next, we need to figure out how much butter is needed for 16 dozen cookies. If 16 dozen cookies require 4 pounds of butter, we can set up a proportion: 16 dozen cookies / 4 pounds of butter = 1 dozen cookies / x pounds of butter To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 16 dozen cookies * x pounds of butter = 4 pounds of butter * 1 dozen cookies 16x = 48 x = 3 Therefore, Valerie will need 3 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen cookies for the weekend. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Yvonne brings a box of chocolates to school. Half have nuts and half do not. The students eat 80% of the ones with nuts and eat half of the ones without nuts. If there are 28 chocolates left, how many chocolates were in the box?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that there were x chocolates in the box. Since half of them have nuts and half do not, we can say that there were x/2 chocolates with nuts and x/2 chocolates without nuts. Now, we know that the students ate 80% of the chocolates with nuts, which means they ate 0.8(x/2) = 0.4x chocolates with nuts. They also ate half of the chocolates without nuts, which means they ate 0.5(x/2) = 0.25x chocolates without nuts. In total, the students ate 0.4x + 0.25x = 0.65x chocolates. If there are 28 chocolates left, that means the students ate x - 28 chocolates. So we can set up the equation: 0.65x = x - 28 Solving for x: 0.35x = 28 x = 80 Therefore, there were 80 chocolates in the box. The answer is 80.\n\n\nQ: In preparation for the church fundraiser, Julia bakes one less than 5 cakes per day for 6 days.  Unfortunately, every other day, Julia's brother, Clifford, sneaks into Julia's house and eats one of Julia's cakes.  At the end of 6 days, how many cakes does Julia have remaining?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cakes Julia bakes per day. We know that she bakes one less than 5 cakes per day, so that means she bakes 4 cakes per day. Next, we need to figure out how many cakes Julia bakes in total over the 6 days. To do this, we can multiply the number of cakes she bakes per day (4) by the number of days she bakes (6): 4 cakes/day x 6 days = 24 cakes So Julia bakes a total of 24 cakes over the 6 days. Now we need to figure out how many cakes Clifford eats. We know that he eats one of Julia's cakes every other day, so that means he eats 3 cakes over the 6 days (since there are 3 pairs of days where he eats a cake). Finally, we can subtract the number of cakes Clifford eats from the total number of cakes Julia bakes to find out how many cakes she has remaining: 24 cakes - 3 cakes = 21 cakes So Julia has 21 cakes remaining at the end of the 6 days. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Traci and Harris are baking cakes together. Traci has brought flour from her own house and Harris has 400g of flour in his house. Each cake needs 100g of flour and Traci and Harris have created 9 cakes each. How much flour, in grams, did Traci bring from her own house?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much flour they have in total. Harris has 400g of flour and Traci brought some from her own house, so we can represent the total amount of flour as: Total flour = 400g + Traci's flour Next, we need to find out how much flour they used in total. They made 9 cakes each, and each cake needs 100g of flour, so the total amount of flour used is: Total flour used = 9 cakes x 100g/cake x 2 people = 1800g Now we can set up an equation to solve for Traci's flour: Total flour = 400g + Traci's flour Traci's flour = Total flour - 400g We know that the total flour used is 1800g, so we can substitute that in: Traci's flour = 1800g - 400g Traci's flour = 1400g Therefore, Traci brought 1400g of flour from her own house. The answer is 1400.\n\n\n"
