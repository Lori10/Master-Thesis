  "test_question": "Q: If a bag of marbles costs $20 and the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, how much would a bag of marbles cost after 36 months?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: There are 50 marbles in a box which has a mixture of white, red and blue marbles. There were originally 20 white marbles and an equal number of red and blue marbles. Jack removes a number of marbles equal to double the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles. How many marbles are left in the box?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 20 white marbles and an equal number of red and blue marbles. So, we can say that there are 20 white, 15 red, and 15 blue marbles in the box. Next, we need to find the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles. In this case, the difference is 20 - 15 = 5. Then, we need to double that difference, which gives us 5 x 2 = 10. Jack removes 10 marbles from the box. So, the number of marbles left in the box is 50 - 10 = 40 marbles. The answer is 40.\n\n\nQ: A bag of dozen apples costs $14 and Brian has already spent $10 on kiwis and half that much on bananas. What's the maximum number of apples Brian can buy if he left his house with only $50 and needs to pay the $3.50 subway fare each way?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much money Brian has left after paying for the subway fare. He needs to pay $3.50 each way, so that's a total of $7 for the round trip. Therefore, he has $50 - $7 = $43 left to spend on groceries. Next, we need to figure out how much money Brian has already spent on bananas. We know he spent half as much on bananas as he did on kiwis, and he spent $10 on kiwis. So he spent $10 / 2 = $5 on bananas. Now we can subtract the amount Brian has already spent on kiwis and bananas from the total amount he has left to spend on groceries: $43 - $10 - $5 = $28. Finally, we need to figure out how many bags of apples Brian can buy with $28. We know that one bag of apples costs $14, so we can divide $28 by $14 to get the maximum number of bags of apples Brian can buy: $28 / $14 = 2. Therefore, the maximum number of bags of apples Brian can buy is 2. Since each bag contains a dozen apples, he can buy a total of 2 x 12 = 24 apples. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Apples used to cost $1.6 per pound.  The price got raised 25%.  How much does it cost to buy 2 pounds of apples for each person in a 4 member family?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Calculate the new price of apples after the 25% increase. The price increase is 25% of $1.6, which is (25/100) x $1.6 = $0.4. So, the new price of apples is $1.6 + $0.4 = $2. Step 2: Calculate the cost of buying 2 pounds of apples for each person in the family. Since there are 4 members in the family, we need to buy 2 x 4 = 8 pounds of apples in total. The cost of buying 1 pound of apples is $2, so the cost of buying 8 pounds of apples is 8 x $2 = $16. Therefore, it would cost $16 to buy 2 pounds of apples for each person in a 4 member family. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Marco has $24. Mary has $15. If Marco gives Mary half of what he has, Mary will have more than Marco. But Mary spends $5. How much more money does Mary have than Marco?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much money Marco gives to Mary. Since Marco has $24, half of that would be $12. So, Marco gives $12 to Mary. After receiving $12 from Marco, Mary will have $15 + $12 = $27. However, Mary spends $5, so we need to subtract that from her total. $27 - $5 = $22. Therefore, Mary has $22 more than Marco. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: To buy a book, you pay $20 for each of the first 5 books at the supermarket, and for each additional book you buy over $20, you receive a discount of $2. If Beatrice bought 20 books, how much did she pay at the supermarket?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the first 5 books, which is simply: $20 x 5 = $100 Next, we need to calculate the cost of the remaining 15 books. Since Beatrice gets a $2 discount for each book over $20, we can calculate the cost of each book as: $20 - $2 = $18 Therefore, the cost of the remaining 15 books is: $18 x 15 = $270 Finally, we can calculate the total cost by adding the cost of the first 5 books to the cost of the remaining 15 books: $100 + $270 = $370 Therefore, Beatrice paid $370 at the supermarket for 20 books. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Cleo and Ignacio placed 30 of their marbles in a jar on a Monday. They took 3/5 of the marbles from the jar the next day and divided them equally. On the third day, Cleo took 1/2 of the marbles remaining in the jars. How many marbles did Cleo have on the third day?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many marbles were taken from the jar on the second day. 3/5 of 30 marbles = (3/5) x 30 = 18 marbles So, 18 marbles were taken from the jar on the second day. Step 2: Find out how many marbles were left in the jar after the second day. 30 - 18 = 12 marbles So, 12 marbles were left in the jar after the second day. Step 3: Find out how many marbles Cleo took on the third day. 1/2 of 12 marbles = (1/2) x 12 = 6 marbles So, Cleo took 6 marbles on the third day. Step 4: Find out how many marbles Cleo had on the third day. Cleo had 6 marbles on the third day. Therefore, Cleo had 6 marbles on the third day. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of 18 watermelons. Since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, the total weight of 18 watermelons would be: 23 x 18 = 414 pounds Next, we need to find the total amount of money Farmer Kent would make by selling these watermelons. Since he sells them for $2 a pound, we can multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 414 x $2 = $828 Therefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight. The answer is 18.\n\n\n"
