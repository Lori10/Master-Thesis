  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour. Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour.  Oliver can read 40 pages.  How many pages can Carter read in 1 hour?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Oliver can read 40 pages in 1 hour. Next, we know that Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour, so Lucy can read 40 + 20 = 60 pages in 1 hour. Finally, we know that Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour, so Carter can read 60 / 2 = 30 pages in 1 hour. Therefore, Carter can read 30 pages in 1 hour. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Ivan has 20 dice. Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. How many dice do they have altogether?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Ivan has 20 dice. Next, we know that Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. So, we can multiply Ivan's number of dice by 2 to find Jerry's number of dice: 20 x 2 = 40 Therefore, Jerry has 40 dice. To find the total number of dice they have altogether, we can add Ivan's and Jerry's number of dice: 20 + 40 = 60 Therefore, they have 60 dice altogether. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Jim had 365 trading cards. He gives 8 sets of cards to his brother, 5 sets of cards to his sister, and 2 sets of cards to his friend. How many cards did he give away, assuming 1 set has 13 trading cards?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cards are in one set. We know that one set has 13 trading cards, so we can multiply 13 by the number of sets given away to find the total number of cards given away. Jim gave 8 sets of cards to his brother, so he gave away 8 x 13 = 104 cards. Jim also gave 5 sets of cards to his sister, so he gave away 5 x 13 = 65 cards. Finally, Jim gave 2 sets of cards to his friend, so he gave away 2 x 13 = 26 cards. To find the total number of cards Jim gave away, we can add up the number of cards given away to each person: 104 + 65 + 26 = 195 Therefore, Jim gave away a total of 195 trading cards. The answer is 195.\n\n\nQ: Janice can type 6 sentences per minute. Today at work, Janice continued working on a paper she started typing yesterday. She typed for 20 minutes, took a break, and typed 15 minutes longer. She then had to erase 40 sentences she had typed incorrectly. After a meeting, she typed for 18 minutes more. In all, the paper had 536 sentences by the end of today. How many sentences did she start with today?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many sentences Janice typed in the first 20 minutes: 6 sentences/minute x 20 minutes = 120 sentences Next, let's find out how many sentences Janice typed in the additional 15 minutes: 6 sentences/minute x 15 minutes = 90 sentences Now, let's subtract the 40 sentences she had to erase: 120 sentences + 90 sentences - 40 sentences = 170 sentences So, Janice typed 170 sentences before the meeting. We know that the paper had 536 sentences by the end of the day, so we can subtract the 170 sentences Janice typed before the meeting to find out how many sentences she started with: 536 sentences - 170 sentences = 366 sentences Therefore, Janice started with 366 sentences today. The answer is 366.\n\n\nQ: Grady has 20 red numbered cubes and 15 blue numbered cubes. He gives his friend Gage 2/5 of his red numbered cubes and 1/3 of the blue numbered cubes. If Gage had 10 red numbered cubes and 12 blue numbered cubes, find the total number of cubes Gage has?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red numbered cubes Grady gave to Gage. Grady gave 2/5 of his 20 red numbered cubes, which is: 2/5 x 20 = 8 red numbered cubes Next, we need to find out how many blue numbered cubes Grady gave to Gage. Grady gave 1/3 of his 15 blue numbered cubes, which is: 1/3 x 15 = 5 blue numbered cubes Now we know that Gage has 10 red numbered cubes and 12 blue numbered cubes, which means he received 8 red numbered cubes and 5 blue numbered cubes from Grady. To find the total number of cubes Gage has, we can add up all the cubes: 10 (red numbered cubes) + 12 (blue numbered cubes) + 8 (red numbered cubes from Grady) + 5 (blue numbered cubes from Grady) = 35 cubes Therefore, Gage has a total of 35 cubes. The answer is 35.\n\n\nQ: Jill spends time every day talking to her boyfriend on the phone.  The first day of the week she spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend.  Each of the following days she spends twice as much time talking on the phone as the day before. After the 5th day her parents take the phone away from her because she was on it too long.  How much time did Jill spend talking to her boyfriend that week?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Jill spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend. On the second day, she spends twice as much time as the first day, which is 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 minutes. On the third day, she spends twice as much time as the second day, which is 2*10=<<2*10=20>>20 minutes. On the fourth day, she spends twice as much time as the third day, which is 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 minutes. On the fifth day, she spends twice as much time as the fourth day, which is 2*40=<<2*40=80>>80 minutes. Therefore, Jill spends a total of 5+10+20+40+80=<<5+10+20+40+80=155>>155 minutes talking to her boyfriend that week. The answer is 155.\n\n\nQ: Peter and Kristin are to read 20 fantasy novels each in a week. Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin. If Peter reads one book in 18 hours, how long will Kristin read half of her books?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Peter to read one book. We know that he can read one book in 18 hours, so we can write: Peter's reading speed = 1 book / 18 hours Next, we need to find out how long it takes Kristin to read one book. We know that Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin, so we can write: Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * Peter's reading speed Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * (1 book / 18 hours) Kristin's reading speed = 1 book / 54 hours Now we can use Kristin's reading speed to find out how long it takes her to read half of her books. We know that she needs to read 20 books in a week, so she needs to read 10 books in half a week (3.5 days). We can write: Time to read 10 books = 10 books * (1 book / 54 hours) * (24 hours / 1 day) * (3.5 days) Time to read 10 books = 14 hours and 27 minutes Therefore, it will take Kristin 14 hours and 27 minutes to read half of her books. The answer is 27.\n\n\nQ: Michael has $42. Michael gives away half the money to his brother. His brother then buys 3 dollars worth of candy. If his brother has $35 left, how much money, in dollars, did his brother have at first?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Michael had $42. Next, he gave away half of that money to his brother, which is $21. His brother then spent $3 on candy, leaving him with $35. To figure out how much money his brother had at first, we need to work backwards. If his brother had $35 after spending $3 on candy, then he had $38 before buying the candy. And if his brother received $21 from Michael, then he must have had $17 to begin with. Therefore, his brother had $17 at first. The answer is 17.\n\n\n"
