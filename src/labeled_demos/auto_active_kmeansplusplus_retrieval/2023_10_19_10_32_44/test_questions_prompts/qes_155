  "formatted_prompt": "Q: On Friday, Hank opened his used-bicycle store with a stock of bicycles, all fixed-up and ready to ride. Over the course of the day, he sold 10 bicycles and bought an additional 15 to fix up. On Saturday, he sold 12 bicycles and bought 8 more. And on Sunday, he sold 9 bicycles and bought 11 more. What was the net increase in the number of bicycles in stock in Hank's store over the three days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On Friday, Hank sold 10 bicycles and bought 15 more, so the net increase in the number of bicycles in stock was 15 - 10 = 5. On Saturday, he sold 12 bicycles and bought 8 more, so the net decrease in the number of bicycles in stock was 12 - 8 = 4. On Sunday, he sold 9 bicycles and bought 11 more, so the net increase in the number of bicycles in stock was 11 - 9 = 2. To find the overall net increase in the number of bicycles in stock over the three days, we need to add up the net increases and net decreases: Net increase on Friday = 5 Net decrease on Saturday = -4 Net increase on Sunday = 2 Overall net increase = 5 - 4 + 2 = 3 Therefore, the net increase in the number of bicycles in stock in Hank's store over the three days was 3. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: There are 10 cars parked in a mall\u2019s parking lot, each with the same number of customers inside. Each customer only makes 1 purchase. If the sports store makes 20 sales and the music store makes 30 sales, how many customers are in each of the cars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of sales made in the parking lot. We can do this by adding the number of sales made by the sports store and the music store: 20 + 30 = 50 So, there were 50 purchases made in total. Next, we need to find out how many customers were in each car. We know that there are 10 cars, and each car has the same number of customers. Let's call the number of customers in each car \"x\". So, the total number of customers in all the cars is: 10x And we know that this is equal to the total number of purchases made: 10x = 50 To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 10: x = 5 So, there were 5 customers in each car. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: A big box store sees 175 people enter their store every hour.  This number doubles during the holiday season.  During the holiday season, how many customers will this big box store see in 8 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers the store sees in one hour during the holiday season. To do this, we can double the number of customers the store sees in a regular hour: 175 x 2 = 350 So during the holiday season, the store sees 350 customers per hour. Next, we need to find out how many customers the store will see in 8 hours during the holiday season. To do this, we can multiply the number of customers per hour by the number of hours: 350 x 8 = 2800 Therefore, during the holiday season, the big box store will see 2800 customers in 8 hours. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: A bicycle shop owner adds 3 bikes to her stock every week. After 1 month, she had sold 18 bikes but still had 45 bikes in stock. How many bikes did she have originally?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's figure out how many weeks are in a month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of bikes added each week (3) by the number of weeks in a month (4) to find out how many bikes were added in total: 3 bikes/week x 4 weeks/month = 12 bikes/month Next, we can subtract the number of bikes sold (18) from the number of bikes in stock after 1 month (45) to find out how many bikes were in stock before any were sold: 45 bikes - 18 bikes = 27 bikes Finally, we can add the number of bikes added in total (12) to the number of bikes in stock before any were sold (27) to find out how many bikes the shop owner originally had: 27 bikes + 12 bikes = 39 bikes Therefore, the shop owner originally had 39 bikes in stock. The answer is 39.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: Merry had 50 boxes of apples on Saturday and 25 boxes on Sunday. There were 10 apples in each box. If she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, how many boxes of apples are left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many apples Merry had in total. On Saturday, she had 50 boxes of apples, and each box had 10 apples, so she had 50 x 10 = 500 apples on Saturday. On Sunday, she had 25 boxes of apples, and each box had 10 apples, so she had 25 x 10 = 250 apples on Sunday. In total, she had 500 + 250 = 750 apples. Next, we need to find out how many apples she sold. We know that she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, so she must have had 750 - 720 = 30 apples left. Finally, we need to find out how many boxes of apples she has left. We know that there are 10 apples in each box, so she must have 30 / 10 = 3 boxes of apples left. Therefore, Merry has 3 boxes of apples left. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: There are 1250 pairs of shoes in the warehouse. There are 540 pairs that are blue. The rest are either green or purple. The number of green shoes is equal to the number of purple shoes. How many pairs of purple shoes are in the warehouse?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 1250 pairs of shoes in the warehouse. Next, we know that 540 pairs are blue. So, the number of shoes that are not blue is: 1250 - 540 = 710 We also know that the number of green shoes is equal to the number of purple shoes. Let's call the number of purple shoes \"x\". So, the number of green shoes is also \"x\". Therefore, the total number of non-blue shoes can be expressed as: x + x = 2x And we know that: 2x = 710 To solve for \"x\", we can divide both sides by 2: x = 355 So, there are 355 pairs of purple shoes in the warehouse. The answer is 355.\n\n\nQ: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Bertha started with two balls and gave one to her partner, so she has one ball left. Next, we need to figure out how many balls she loses and how many wear out. In 20 games, she loses 20/5 = 4 balls and 20/10 = 2 balls wear out. Finally, we need to figure out how many balls she buys. In 20 games, she buys 20/4 = 5 canisters of three balls, which is a total of 5*3 = 15 balls. So, in total, Bertha has 1 (starting ball) - 4 (lost balls) - 2 (worn out balls) + 15 (bought balls) = 10 tennis balls. The answer is 10.\n\n\n"
