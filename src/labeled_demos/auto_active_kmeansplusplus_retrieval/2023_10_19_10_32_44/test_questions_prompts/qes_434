  "test_question": "Q: Suzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each and 60 cupcakes for $4 each. She gave her two sisters $10 each for helping her. How much money does she have left from her earnings?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Brenda volunteered to make 3 trays of banana pudding for the family reunion.  Each tray of banana pudding would need 80 wafer cookies.  A box of wafer cookies only had 60 cookies per box.  Each box costs $3.50.  How much will it cost her to buy just enough boxes for 3 trays of banana pudding?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many wafer cookies Brenda needs in total. She needs 80 cookies per tray and she's making 3 trays, so she needs: 80 x 3 = 240 wafer cookies Next, we need to figure out how many boxes of cookies she needs to buy. Each box has 60 cookies, so we can divide the total number of cookies needed by the number of cookies per box: 240 \u00f7 60 = 4 boxes So Brenda needs to buy 4 boxes of cookies. Each box costs $3.50, so we can multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box: 4 x $3.50 = $14 Therefore, it will cost Brenda $14 to buy just enough boxes for 3 trays of banana pudding. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Carl has a goal of selling 96 cupcakes in 2 days. Carl needs to give 24 cupcakes to Bonnie as payment for using her storefront. How many cupcakes must Carl sell per day to reach his goal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to subtract the 24 cupcakes that Carl needs to give to Bonnie from his goal of selling 96 cupcakes. 96 - 24 = 72 So Carl needs to sell 72 cupcakes in 2 days. To find out how many cupcakes he needs to sell per day, we can divide 72 by 2: 72 \u00f7 2 = 36 Therefore, Carl needs to sell 36 cupcakes per day to reach his goal of selling 96 cupcakes in 2 days, after giving 24 cupcakes to Bonnie. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: At Penny\u2019s bakery, her famous blueberry cheesecakes are $7 a slice.  Each cheesecake pie is cut into 6 thick slices.  If she sells 7 cheesecake pies, how much money does she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of cheesecake Penny has in total. Since each cheesecake pie is cut into 6 slices, we can multiply 6 by the number of cheesecake pies she sold: 6 slices/pie x 7 pies = 42 slices So Penny sold 42 slices of blueberry cheesecake. Next, we need to find out how much money she made from selling those 42 slices. Each slice costs $7, so we can multiply 7 by the number of slices: $7/slice x 42 slices = $294 Therefore, Penny made $294 from selling 7 cheesecake pies. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Five people are planning a party. Sonja will buy a loaf of French bread ($3 a loaf) and a platter of cold cuts ($23). Barbara will buy the soda ($1 per person) and two boxes of crackers ($2 per box). Mario and Rick will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles ($3 per package). Danica will supply a package of paper plates for $4. How much more will Sonja spend than the rest of the office put together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of Barbara's contribution. She will buy soda for 5 people, which will cost $5 (1 dollar per person). She will also buy two boxes of crackers, which will cost $4 (2 dollars per box). Therefore, Barbara's total contribution will be $9. Next, let's calculate the total cost of Mario and Rick's contribution. They will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles, which will cost $6 in total (3 dollars per package). Now, let's add up the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's. Barbara's contribution is $9, Mario and Rick's contribution is $6, and Danica's contribution is $4. Therefore, the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's is $19. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of Sonja's contribution. She will buy a loaf of French bread for $3 and a platter of cold cuts for $23. Therefore, Sonja's total contribution will be $26. To find out how much more Sonja will spend than the rest of the office put together, we need to subtract the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's from Sonja's total contribution. $26 (Sonja's contribution) - $19 (total cost of everyone else's contribution) = $7 Therefore, Sonja will spend $7 more than the rest of the office put together. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Mary wants 144 cupcakes for her party. Mary has already made 36 cherry cupcakes, and 48 berry cupcakes. Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes for the rest. How much of each should she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Mary has already made: 36 cherry + 48 berry = 84 cupcakes Next, we need to figure out how many more cupcakes Mary needs to make: 144 total cupcakes - 84 cupcakes already made = 60 cupcakes Since Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, we can divide the remaining 60 cupcakes by 2: 60 cupcakes \u00f7 2 = 30 cupcakes of each flavor Therefore, Mary should make 30 chocolate cupcakes and 30 vanilla cupcakes to have a total of 144 cupcakes for her party. The answer is 144.\n\n\nQ: Francis and Kiera had breakfast at a cafe. Muffins cost $2 each, and fruit cups cost $3 each. Francis had 2 muffins and 2 fruit cups. Kiera had 2 muffins and 1 fruit cup. How much did their breakfast cost?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the cost of Francis's breakfast. 2 muffins cost 2 x $2 = $4 2 fruit cups cost 2 x $3 = $6 So Francis's breakfast cost $4 + $6 = $10 Now let's calculate the cost of Kiera's breakfast. 2 muffins cost 2 x $2 = $4 1 fruit cup costs $3 So Kiera's breakfast cost $4 + $3 = $7 Finally, let's add the cost of Francis's and Kiera's breakfast to find the total cost. $10 + $7 = $17 Therefore, their breakfast cost $17 in total. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Michael has $42. Michael gives away half the money to his brother. His brother then buys 3 dollars worth of candy. If his brother has $35 left, how much money, in dollars, did his brother have at first?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Michael had $42. Next, he gave away half of that money to his brother, which is $21. His brother then spent $3 on candy, leaving him with $35. To figure out how much money his brother had at first, we need to work backwards. If his brother had $35 after spending $3 on candy, then he had $38 before buying the candy. And if his brother received $21 from Michael, then he must have had $17 to begin with. Therefore, his brother had $17 at first. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how much money Carl will earn in four weeks. If he earns $0.50 every time, and he buys a candy bar each time, that means he's spending $0.50 each week. But he's also earning $0.75 each week for taking out his neighbor's trash. So his net earnings each week are $0.75 - $0.50 = $0.25. Over four weeks, that's a total of $0.25 x 4 = $1. So Carl will have $1 to spend on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.50, he can buy 2 candy bars with his earnings. The answer is 2.\n\n\n"
