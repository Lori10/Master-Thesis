  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Dylan's mother is throwing a baby shower for her best friend. She is expecting 40 guests, of whom she has cleared the parking lot to park in to, leaving only her car and her husband's jeep in the parking lot. The 40 guests, though, arrive in only 10 cars that they park in the parking lot.  If each car has 4 wheels, how many car wheels are there in the parking lot, including both of Dylan's parent's car wheels?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many wheels the 10 cars have in total. Since each car has 4 wheels, we can multiply 10 by 4 to get: 10 x 4 = 40 So, the 10 cars have a total of 40 wheels. Next, we need to add the wheels of Dylan's parent's cars. Since we know they have one car and one jeep, we can calculate the total number of wheels by adding the number of wheels for each vehicle. A car has 4 wheels and a jeep has 4 wheels, so we can add: 4 + 4 = 8 Therefore, there are a total of 40 + 8 = 48 wheels in the parking lot, including both of Dylan's parent's car wheels. The answer is 48.\n\n\nQ: There are 10 cars parked in a mall\u2019s parking lot, each with the same number of customers inside. Each customer only makes 1 purchase. If the sports store makes 20 sales and the music store makes 30 sales, how many customers are in each of the cars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of sales made in the parking lot. We can do this by adding the number of sales made by the sports store and the music store: 20 + 30 = 50 So, there were 50 purchases made in total. Next, we need to find out how many customers were in each car. We know that there are 10 cars, and each car has the same number of customers. Let's call the number of customers in each car \"x\". So, the total number of customers in all the cars is: 10x And we know that this is equal to the total number of purchases made: 10x = 50 To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 10: x = 5 So, there were 5 customers in each car. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: For homework, Juan's teacher asked everyone in the class, to write down the different types of transportation (cars, trucks, bicycles, skateboards etc) they saw on their way home that afternoon.  After school, Juan walked home and saw the following: 15 cars, 3 bicycles, 8 pickup trucks and 1 tricycle.  How many tires in total were there on the vehicles Juan saw?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine the number of tires on each type of vehicle. - Cars have 4 tires each, so 15 cars would have 15 x 4 = 60 tires. - Bicycles have 2 tires each, so 3 bicycles would have 3 x 2 = 6 tires. - Pickup trucks have 4 tires each, so 8 pickup trucks would have 8 x 4 = 32 tires. - A tricycle has 3 tires. To find the total number of tires, we add up the number of tires for each type of vehicle: 60 + 6 + 32 + 3 = 101 Therefore, Juan saw a total of 101 tires on the vehicles he saw on his way home. The answer is 101.\n\n\nQ: A train leaves its departure station with 6 coal cars, 12 iron cars, and 2 wood cars. Between each station, there are 6 miles, and it takes 25 minutes to travel between them. At each station, the train can deposit up to 2 coal cars, 3 iron cars, and 1 wood car. How many minutes will it take to deliver all the cars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find the total number of cars the train has: 6 coal cars + 12 iron cars + 2 wood cars = 20 cars Next, let's find the maximum number of cars the train can deposit at each station: 2 coal cars + 3 iron cars + 1 wood car = 6 cars To deliver all 20 cars, the train will need to make multiple trips between stations. For each trip, the train can deposit 6 cars. So, the number of trips the train will need to make is: 20 cars \u00f7 6 cars per trip = 3.33 trips Since the train cannot make a partial trip, it will need to make 4 trips. Each trip takes 25 minutes, so the total time it will take to deliver all the cars is: 4 trips x 25 minutes per trip = 100 minutes The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: A factory decides to stop making cars and start making motorcycles instead. When it made cars, per month, it cost $100 for materials, they could make 4 cars, and they sold each car for $50. Now that they make motorcycles it costs $250 for materials, but they sell 8 of them for $50 each. How much more profit do they make per month selling motorcycles instead of cars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the profit made per car: Revenue per car = $50 Cost per car = $100/4 = $25 Profit per car = Revenue per car - Cost per car = $50 - $25 = $25 Now, let's calculate the profit made per motorcycle: Revenue per motorcycle = $50 x 8 = $400 Cost per motorcycle = $250 Profit per motorcycle = Revenue per motorcycle - Cost per motorcycle = $400 - $250 = $150 Finally, let's calculate the difference in profit between making cars and making motorcycles: Profit difference = Profit per motorcycle - Profit per car = $150 - $25 = $125 Therefore, the factory makes $125 more profit per month by making motorcycles instead of cars. The answer is 125.\n\n\nQ: A library has a number of books. 35% of them are intended for children and 104 of them are for adults. How many books are in the library?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 35% of the books are intended for children. This means that 65% of the books are intended for adults. We also know that there are 104 books intended for adults. To find the total number of books in the library, we can set up a proportion: 65/100 = 104/x We can cross-multiply to solve for x: 65x = 10400 x = 160 Therefore, there are 160 books in the library. The answer is 160.\n\n\nQ: A car driving cross-country traveled 180 miles in 4 hours. At this rate of speed, how many miles further will the car travel in the next 3 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the car's speed in miles per hour (mph). To do this, we divide the distance traveled by the time taken: Speed = Distance \u00f7 Time Speed = 180 miles \u00f7 4 hours Speed = 45 mph Now that we know the car's speed, we can use it to calculate how far it will travel in the next 3 hours: Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time Distance = 45 mph \u00d7 3 hours Distance = 135 miles Therefore, the car will travel 135 miles further in the next 3 hours. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: John is working as an IT specialist. He repairs broken computers. One day he had to fix 20 computers. 20% of them were unfixable, and 40% of them needed to wait a few days for spare parts to come. The rest John was able to fix right away. How many computers John was able to fix right away?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many computers were unfixable. We know that 20% of 20 computers were unfixable, so we can calculate: 20% of 20 = 0.2 x 20 = 4 So, John couldn't fix 4 computers. Next, we need to find out how many computers needed to wait for spare parts. We know that 40% of 20 computers needed to wait, so we can calculate: 40% of 20 = 0.4 x 20 = 8 So, 8 computers needed to wait for spare parts. Now, we can subtract the unfixable and waiting computers from the total to find out how many John was able to fix right away: 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 Therefore, John was able to fix 8 computers right away. The answer is 8.\n\n\n"
