  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Last night Kannon had 3 apples, a banana, and 4 oranges for dinner. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, and twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today. How many fruits would she have eaten so far in the two meals?\nA: Let's think step by step. Last night Kannon had 3 apples, 1 banana, and 4 oranges, so she had a total of 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 fruits. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, which means she will have 3 + 4 = 7 apples today. She is also planning to have 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, which means she will have 1 x 10 = 10 bananas today. Finally, she is planning to have twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today, which means she will have 7 x 2 = 14 oranges today. Therefore, in total, Kannon will have eaten 7 + 10 + 14 = 31 fruits in the two meals. The answer is 31.\n\n\nQ: Sandra eats 3 beignets every morning.  How many beignets will she eat in 16 weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many beignets Sandra eats in one week. To do this, we can multiply the number of beignets she eats in one day (3) by the number of days in a week (7): 3 beignets/day x 7 days/week = 21 beignets/week So Sandra eats 21 beignets in one week. Next, we need to find out how many beignets she will eat in 16 weeks. To do this, we can multiply the number of beignets she eats in one week (21) by the number of weeks (16): 21 beignets/week x 16 weeks = 336 beignets Therefore, Sandra will eat 336 beignets in 16 weeks. The answer is 16.\n\n\nQ: In preparation for the church fundraiser, Julia bakes one less than 5 cakes per day for 6 days.  Unfortunately, every other day, Julia's brother, Clifford, sneaks into Julia's house and eats one of Julia's cakes.  At the end of 6 days, how many cakes does Julia have remaining?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cakes Julia bakes per day. We know that she bakes one less than 5 cakes per day, so that means she bakes 4 cakes per day. Next, we need to figure out how many cakes Julia bakes in total over the 6 days. To do this, we can multiply the number of cakes she bakes per day (4) by the number of days she bakes (6): 4 cakes/day x 6 days = 24 cakes So Julia bakes a total of 24 cakes over the 6 days. Now we need to figure out how many cakes Clifford eats. We know that he eats one of Julia's cakes every other day, so that means he eats 3 cakes over the 6 days (since there are 3 pairs of days where he eats a cake). Finally, we can subtract the number of cakes Clifford eats from the total number of cakes Julia bakes to find out how many cakes she has remaining: 24 cakes - 3 cakes = 21 cakes So Julia has 21 cakes remaining at the end of the 6 days. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: James takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces.  He splits the pieces between 4 people.  If an orange has 80 calories how many calories does each person get?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pieces James has in total. He takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces, so he has 5 x 8 = 40 pieces in total. Next, we need to divide the pieces between 4 people. To do this, we can divide the total number of pieces by 4: 40 \u00f7 4 = 10 pieces per person. Finally, we need to find out how many calories each person gets. We know that one orange has 80 calories, so each piece has 80 \u00f7 8 = 10 calories. Therefore, each person gets 10 x 10 = 100 calories. So each person gets 100 calories. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Lassie eats half of her bones on Saturday. On Sunday she received 10 more bones. She now has a total of 35 bones. How many bones did she start with before eating them on Saturday?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Lassie ate half of her bones on Saturday. Let's call the total number of bones she started with \"x\". Then, we can write an equation: x/2 This represents the number of bones Lassie had left after eating half of them on Saturday. Next, we know that on Sunday she received 10 more bones. So we can add 10 to the number of bones she had left: x/2 + 10 This represents the total number of bones she had on Sunday. Finally, we know that she now has a total of 35 bones. So we can set up another equation: x/2 + 10 = 35 Now we can solve for x: x/2 = 25 x = 50 Therefore, Lassie started with 50 bones before eating them on Saturday. The answer is 50.\n\n\nQ: Valerie\u2019s cookie recipe makes 16 dozen cookies and calls for 4 pounds of butter.  She only wants to make 4 dozen cookies for the weekend.  How many pounds of butter will she need?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cookies Valerie needs to make for the weekend. Since she only wants to make 4 dozen cookies, we can calculate that as: 4 dozen cookies = 4 x 12 = 48 cookies Next, we need to figure out how much butter is needed for 16 dozen cookies. If 16 dozen cookies require 4 pounds of butter, we can set up a proportion: 16 dozen cookies / 4 pounds of butter = 1 dozen cookies / x pounds of butter To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 16 dozen cookies * x pounds of butter = 4 pounds of butter * 1 dozen cookies 16x = 48 x = 3 Therefore, Valerie will need 3 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen cookies for the weekend. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Merry had 50 boxes of apples on Saturday and 25 boxes on Sunday. There were 10 apples in each box. If she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, how many boxes of apples are left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many apples Merry had in total. On Saturday, she had 50 boxes of apples, and each box had 10 apples, so she had 50 x 10 = 500 apples on Saturday. On Sunday, she had 25 boxes of apples, and each box had 10 apples, so she had 25 x 10 = 250 apples on Sunday. In total, she had 500 + 250 = 750 apples. Next, we need to find out how many apples she sold. We know that she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, so she must have had 750 - 720 = 30 apples left. Finally, we need to find out how many boxes of apples she has left. We know that there are 10 apples in each box, so she must have 30 / 10 = 3 boxes of apples left. Therefore, Merry has 3 boxes of apples left. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Brenda volunteered to make 3 trays of banana pudding for the family reunion.  Each tray of banana pudding would need 80 wafer cookies.  A box of wafer cookies only had 60 cookies per box.  Each box costs $3.50.  How much will it cost her to buy just enough boxes for 3 trays of banana pudding?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many wafer cookies Brenda needs in total. She needs 80 cookies per tray and she's making 3 trays, so she needs: 80 x 3 = 240 wafer cookies Next, we need to figure out how many boxes of cookies she needs to buy. Each box has 60 cookies, so we can divide the total number of cookies needed by the number of cookies per box: 240 \u00f7 60 = 4 boxes So Brenda needs to buy 4 boxes of cookies. Each box costs $3.50, so we can multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box: 4 x $3.50 = $14 Therefore, it will cost Brenda $14 to buy just enough boxes for 3 trays of banana pudding. The answer is 3.\n\n\n"
