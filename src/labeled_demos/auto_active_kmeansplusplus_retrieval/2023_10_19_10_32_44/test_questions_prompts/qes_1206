  "test_question": "Q: Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than can Brittany's phone.  The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.  If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Six more than twice as many ducks go to North Pond as go to Lake Michigan. If Lake Michigan has 100 ducks, how many ducks can you safely estimate there will be at North Pond?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many ducks go to North Pond. We know that \"Six more than twice as many ducks go to North Pond as go to Lake Michigan.\" So, we can start by finding twice as many ducks as Lake Michigan: 2 x 100 = 200 Now, we add six to that: 200 + 6 = 206 Therefore, we can safely estimate that there will be 206 ducks at North Pond. The answer is 206.\n\n\nQ: Alyssa took 100 photos on vacation. She wants to put them in a photo album with 30 pages. She can place 3 photos each on the first 10 pages. Then she can place 4 photos each on the next 10 pages. If she wants to put an equal number of photos on each of the remaining pages of the album, how many photos can she place on each page?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Alyssa can place 3 photos each on the first 10 pages, which means she has used 3 x 10 = 30 photos. Then, she can place 4 photos each on the next 10 pages, which means she has used 4 x 10 = 40 photos. So far, she has used 30 + 40 = 70 photos. She has 100 - 70 = 30 photos left to place in the remaining pages. Since she wants to put an equal number of photos on each of the remaining pages, she can divide the remaining photos by the number of remaining pages: 30 \u00f7 10 = 3. Therefore, Alyssa can place 3 photos on each of the remaining 10 pages. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Jill spends time every day talking to her boyfriend on the phone.  The first day of the week she spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend.  Each of the following days she spends twice as much time talking on the phone as the day before. After the 5th day her parents take the phone away from her because she was on it too long.  How much time did Jill spend talking to her boyfriend that week?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Jill spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend. On the second day, she spends twice as much time as the first day, which is 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 minutes. On the third day, she spends twice as much time as the second day, which is 2*10=<<2*10=20>>20 minutes. On the fourth day, she spends twice as much time as the third day, which is 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 minutes. On the fifth day, she spends twice as much time as the fourth day, which is 2*40=<<2*40=80>>80 minutes. Therefore, Jill spends a total of 5+10+20+40+80=<<5+10+20+40+80=155>>155 minutes talking to her boyfriend that week. The answer is 155.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Ivan has 20 dice. Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. How many dice do they have altogether?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Ivan has 20 dice. Next, we know that Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. So, we can multiply Ivan's number of dice by 2 to find Jerry's number of dice: 20 x 2 = 40 Therefore, Jerry has 40 dice. To find the total number of dice they have altogether, we can add Ivan's and Jerry's number of dice: 20 + 40 = 60 Therefore, they have 60 dice altogether. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Aubree saw 20 beavers and 40 chipmunks by a tree when going to school and scared them away when they saw her. While coming back from school, she realized the number of beavers had doubled and the number of chipmunks had decreased by 10. What's the total number of animals she saw that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Aubree saw 20 beavers and 40 chipmunks, so the total number of animals she saw was 20 + 40 = 60. Then, on her way back from school, the number of beavers doubled to 20 x 2 = 40. The number of chipmunks decreased by 10, so there were 40 - 10 = 30 chipmunks. Therefore, the total number of animals Aubree saw that day was 40 + 30 = 70. So, Aubree saw a total of 70 animals that day. The answer is 70.\n\n\nQ: Jaylen has 5 carrots and 2 cucumbers. Jaylen has twice as many bell peppers as Kristin. Jaylen has 3 less than half as many green beans as Kristin. If Kristin has 2 bell peppers and 20 green beans, how many vegetables does Jaylen have in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bell peppers Jaylen has. We know that Jaylen has twice as many bell peppers as Kristin, and Kristin has 2 bell peppers. So, Jaylen has 2 x 2 = 4 bell peppers. Next, we need to find out how many green beans Jaylen has. We know that Jaylen has 3 less than half as many green beans as Kristin, and Kristin has 20 green beans. So, half of 20 is 10, and 3 less than 10 is 7. Therefore, Jaylen has 7 green beans. Now, we can add up all the vegetables Jaylen has: 5 carrots + 2 cucumbers + 4 bell peppers + 7 green beans = 18 vegetables in total. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. If Mabel has 85 marbles, how many more marbles does Mabel have than Amanda?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Katrina has. We know that Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 85 marbles, so we can set up an equation: Mabel's marbles = 5 x Katrina's marbles 85 = 5 x Katrina's marbles Katrina's marbles = 17 Now we know that Katrina has 17 marbles. We also know that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. So we can set up another equation: Amanda's marbles = 2 x Katrina's marbles + 12 Amanda's marbles = 2 x 17 + 12 Amanda's marbles = 46 So Amanda has 46 marbles. Finally, we can figure out how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda: Mabel's marbles - Amanda's marbles = 85 - 46 Mabel's marbles - Amanda's marbles = 39 Therefore, Mabel has 39 more marbles than Amanda. The answer is 39.\n\n\n"
