  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Nine hundred tickets were sold to a concert. Three-fourths of those who bought the ticket came before the start of the concert. Five-ninths of the remaining came few minutes after the first song. Eighty people arrived during the middle part of the concert while the rest did not go. How many of those who bought the tickets did not go?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many people came before the start of the concert. Three-fourths of 900 tickets = (3/4) x 900 = 675 people came before the start of the concert. Step 2: Find out how many people were left after the first group came. 900 - 675 = 225 people were left. Step 3: Find out how many people came few minutes after the first song. Five-ninths of the remaining 225 people = (5/9) x 225 = 125 people came few minutes after the first song. Step 4: Find out how many people were left after the second group came. 225 - 125 = 100 people were left. Step 5: Subtract the number of people who arrived during the middle part of the concert from the number of people left. 100 - 80 = 20 people did not go to the concert. Therefore, 20 people who bought the tickets did not go to the concert. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Mark loves to see shows in theaters. He decided to visit the theater at least once a week. One performance lasts 3 hours. The price of the ticket depends on the time spent in the theater and stands at $5 for each hour. How much will Mark spend on visits to the theater in 6 weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many performances Mark will attend in 6 weeks. Since he wants to visit the theater at least once a week, we can multiply the number of weeks by 1: 6 weeks x 1 performance per week = 6 performances Next, we need to calculate the cost of each performance. We know that one performance lasts 3 hours, so the cost of one performance will be: 3 hours x $5 per hour = $15 Finally, we can calculate the total cost of all 6 performances by multiplying the cost of one performance by the number of performances: $15 per performance x 6 performances = $90 Therefore, Mark will spend $90 on visits to the theater in 6 weeks. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: A performing magician has a disappearing act where he makes a random member of his audience disappear and reappear. Unfortunately, one-tenth of the time, the audience member never reappears. However, one-fifth of the time, two people reappear instead of only one. If the magician has put on 100 performances of the act this year, how many people have reappeared?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people disappear in total. Since the magician chooses a random member of the audience each time, we can assume that one person disappears per performance. Therefore, 100 people have disappeared in total. Next, we need to find out how many times one person reappears. We know that one-tenth of the time, the person never reappears, so that means nine-tenths of the time, they do reappear. Therefore, 90 people have reappeared once. Finally, we need to find out how many times two people reappear. We know that one-fifth of the time, this happens. Since there were 100 performances in total, this means that 20 times, two people reappeared. Therefore, 40 people have reappeared twice. To find the total number of people who have reappeared, we add the number of people who have reappeared once to the number of people who have reappeared twice: 90 + 40 = 130 Therefore, 130 people have reappeared in total. The answer is 130.\n\n\nQ: A book has 8 chapters. Beth has read 2 chapters in 3 hours. If she continues reading at that rate, in how many hours will she be able to finish reading the remaining chapters?\nA: Let's think step by step. Beth has already read 2 chapters, so she needs to read the remaining 8 - 2 = 6 chapters. She can read 2 chapters in 3 hours, so she can read 1 chapter in 3/2 = 1.5 hours. Therefore, she will be able to finish reading the remaining 6 chapters in 6 x 1.5 = 9 hours. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: Stella and Twinkle are filling up a truck with a capacity of 6000 stone blocks at the rate of 250 blocks per hour per person. They work for four hours and are then joined by 6 other people who also work at the same rate. How many hours did filling the truck take?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many blocks Stella and Twinkle can fill in 4 hours. 250 blocks per hour per person x 2 people x 4 hours = 2000 blocks So, after 4 hours, Stella and Twinkle have filled 2000 blocks. Next, we need to find out how many blocks all 8 people can fill in one hour. 250 blocks per hour per person x 8 people = 2000 blocks So, all 8 people can fill 2000 blocks in one hour. Now, we need to find out how many more blocks they need to fill to reach the capacity of 6000 blocks. 6000 blocks - 2000 blocks = 4000 blocks Finally, we can use the rate of 2000 blocks per hour for all 8 people to find out how many hours it will take to fill the remaining 4000 blocks. 4000 blocks \u00f7 2000 blocks per hour = 2 hours Therefore, filling the truck took a total of 4 + 2 = 6 hours. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Betty and Dora started making some cupcakes at the same time. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour and Dora makes 8 every hour. If Betty took a two-hour break, what is the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Betty made in the first 3 hours before taking a break. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour, so in 3 hours, she would make: 10 cupcakes/hour x 3 hours = 30 cupcakes Next, we need to find out how many cupcakes Dora made in the same 5 hours. Dora makes 8 cupcakes every hour, so in 5 hours, she would make: 8 cupcakes/hour x 5 hours = 40 cupcakes Now we need to find the difference between the number of cupcakes they made. Betty made 30 cupcakes before taking a break, and Dora made 40 cupcakes in the same 5 hours. So the difference between the number of cupcakes they made is: 40 cupcakes - 30 cupcakes = 10 cupcakes Therefore, the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours is 10 cupcakes. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: At the zoo, there are 5 different types of animals. Seeing each animal type takes around 6 minutes. How much time would it take to see each animal type if the zoo decided to import 4 new species?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many animal types there will be in total after the zoo imports 4 new species. 5 (original animal types) + 4 (new species) = 9 (total animal types) Next, we need to find out how long it takes to see each animal type. 6 minutes per animal type x 9 animal types = 54 minutes Therefore, it would take 54 minutes to see each animal type if the zoo decided to import 4 new species. The answer is 4.\n\n\n"
