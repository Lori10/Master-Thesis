  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Randy walks his dog twice a day.  After each walk, he wipes his dog's paws off with a baby wipe.  The baby wipes come 120 wipes per pack.  How many packs will he need to make sure he has enough wipes for 360 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how many baby wipes Randy uses per day. Since he walks his dog twice a day and wipes his paws off after each walk, he uses 2 baby wipes per day. Next, we need to figure out how many baby wipes he will need for 360 days. To do this, we can multiply the number of baby wipes he uses per day by the number of days he needs them for: 2 baby wipes/day x 360 days = 720 baby wipes Finally, we need to figure out how many packs of baby wipes he will need to buy to get 720 baby wipes. Since there are 120 baby wipes per pack, we can divide 720 by 120: 720 baby wipes \u00f7 120 baby wipes/pack = 6 packs Therefore, Randy will need to buy 6 packs of baby wipes to make sure he has enough for 360 days. The answer is 360.\n\n\nQ: Eric sorted 150 colored pencils into 5 containers for his art class. Before class, another teacher brought him 30 more pencils. How many can he evenly distribute between the five containers now?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of pencils Eric has now. To do this, we add the original 150 pencils to the 30 pencils brought by the other teacher: 150 + 30 = 180 So Eric now has 180 colored pencils. Next, we need to find out how many pencils he can evenly distribute between the five containers. To do this, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of containers: 180 \u00f7 5 = 36 Therefore, Eric can evenly distribute 36 colored pencils between each of the five containers. The answer is 36.\n\n\nQ: John takes a pill every 6 hours.  How many pills does he take a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 24 hours in a day, so John takes 24/6 = 4 pills per day. In a week, there are 7 days, so John takes 4 x 7 = 28 pills per week. The answer is 28.\n\n\nQ: Jenny wants to read 3 books in the next 10 days. She can read 100 words per hour. If the first book has 200 words, the second book has 400 words, and the third book has 300 words, how many minutes per day, on average, should she spend reading?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find the total number of words in all three books: 200 + 400 + 300 = 900 words Next, let's find the total number of hours it will take Jenny to read all three books: 900 words \u00f7 100 words per hour = 9 hours Now, let's find the average number of minutes per day that Jenny should spend reading: 9 hours \u00f7 10 days = 0.9 hours per day 0.9 hours per day x 60 minutes per hour = 54 minutes per day Therefore, Jenny should spend an average of 54 minutes per day reading to finish all three books in 10 days. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Stacy bought two packs of printer paper for the office. Each pack has 240 sheets of paper. Her office prints 80 one-page documents per day. How many days will the printer paper last her office?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many sheets of paper Stacy bought in total. Since she bought two packs, each with 240 sheets, we can multiply 2 by 240 to get: 2 x 240 = 480 So Stacy bought 480 sheets of paper in total. Next, we need to figure out how many pages her office prints per day. We know they print 80 one-page documents per day, so that means they print: 80 x 1 = 80 pages per day Now we can use this information to figure out how many days the paper will last. We can divide the total number of sheets by the number of pages printed per day: 480 / 80 = 6 So the printer paper will last Stacy's office 6 days. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Monica way studying for an exam. She studied for 2 hours on Wednesday and three times as long on Thursday. On Friday Monica studied half of the time she studied on Thursday. During the weekend (two days) Monica studied as much again as Wednesday, Thursday and Friday combined. How much time did she spend studying in total during the five days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On Wednesday, Monica studied for 2 hours. On Thursday, she studied three times as long as Wednesday, which means she studied for 2 x 3 = 6 hours. On Friday, she studied half of the time she studied on Thursday, which means she studied for 6 / 2 = 3 hours. The total time Monica studied from Wednesday to Friday is 2 + 6 + 3 = 11 hours. During the weekend, Monica studied as much again as Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday combined, which means she studied for 11 x 2 = 22 hours. Therefore, Monica spent a total of 11 + 22 = 33 hours studying during the five days. The answer is 33.\n\n\nQ: Cleo and Ignacio placed 30 of their marbles in a jar on a Monday. They took 3/5 of the marbles from the jar the next day and divided them equally. On the third day, Cleo took 1/2 of the marbles remaining in the jars. How many marbles did Cleo have on the third day?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many marbles were taken from the jar on the second day. 3/5 of 30 marbles = (3/5) x 30 = 18 marbles So, 18 marbles were taken from the jar on the second day. Step 2: Find out how many marbles were left in the jar after the second day. 30 - 18 = 12 marbles So, 12 marbles were left in the jar after the second day. Step 3: Find out how many marbles Cleo took on the third day. 1/2 of 12 marbles = (1/2) x 12 = 6 marbles So, Cleo took 6 marbles on the third day. Step 4: Find out how many marbles Cleo had on the third day. Cleo had 6 marbles on the third day. Therefore, Cleo had 6 marbles on the third day. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\n"
