  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Marco has $24. Mary has $15. If Marco gives Mary half of what he has, Mary will have more than Marco. But Mary spends $5. How much more money does Mary have than Marco?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much money Marco gives to Mary. Since Marco has $24, half of that would be $12. So, Marco gives $12 to Mary. After receiving $12 from Marco, Mary will have $15 + $12 = $27. However, Mary spends $5, so we need to subtract that from her total. $27 - $5 = $22. Therefore, Mary has $22 more than Marco. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Five people are planning a party. Sonja will buy a loaf of French bread ($3 a loaf) and a platter of cold cuts ($23). Barbara will buy the soda ($1 per person) and two boxes of crackers ($2 per box). Mario and Rick will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles ($3 per package). Danica will supply a package of paper plates for $4. How much more will Sonja spend than the rest of the office put together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of Barbara's contribution. She will buy soda for 5 people, which will cost $5 (1 dollar per person). She will also buy two boxes of crackers, which will cost $4 (2 dollars per box). Therefore, Barbara's total contribution will be $9. Next, let's calculate the total cost of Mario and Rick's contribution. They will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles, which will cost $6 in total (3 dollars per package). Now, let's add up the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's. Barbara's contribution is $9, Mario and Rick's contribution is $6, and Danica's contribution is $4. Therefore, the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's is $19. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of Sonja's contribution. She will buy a loaf of French bread for $3 and a platter of cold cuts for $23. Therefore, Sonja's total contribution will be $26. To find out how much more Sonja will spend than the rest of the office put together, we need to subtract the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's from Sonja's total contribution. $26 (Sonja's contribution) - $19 (total cost of everyone else's contribution) = $7 Therefore, Sonja will spend $7 more than the rest of the office put together. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Kathleen saved $21 in June, $46 in July, and $45 in August. Then Kathleen spent $12 on school supplies and $54 on new clothes. Kathleen\u2019s aunt said she would give Kathleen $25 if Kathleen saves more than $125.  How much money does Kathleen have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total amount of money Kathleen saved in those three months. Total savings = $21 + $46 + $45 = $112 Next, we need to subtract the amount Kathleen spent on school supplies and new clothes. Total spent = $12 + $54 = $66 Kathleen's remaining savings = Total savings - Total spent = $112 - $66 = $46 Finally, we need to check if Kathleen saved more than $125 to see if she will receive the additional $25 from her aunt. Total savings + $25 > $125 $46 + $25 > $125 $71 > $125 (False) Since Kathleen did not save more than $125, she will not receive the additional $25 from her aunt. Therefore, Kathleen has $46 left. The answer is 46.\n\n\nQ: Oliver had $9, then he saved $5 from his allowance and spent $4 on a frisbee and $3 on a puzzle. His friend gives him another $8 as it's his birthday. How much money does Oliver have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. Oliver had $9. He saved $5 from his allowance, so he now has $9 + $5 = $14. He spent $4 on a frisbee, so he now has $14 - $4 = $10. He spent another $3 on a puzzle, so he now has $10 - $3 = $7. His friend gives him another $8, so he now has $7 + $8 = $15. Therefore, Oliver has $15 left. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Michael has $42. Michael gives away half the money to his brother. His brother then buys 3 dollars worth of candy. If his brother has $35 left, how much money, in dollars, did his brother have at first?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Michael had $42. Next, he gave away half of that money to his brother, which is $21. His brother then spent $3 on candy, leaving him with $35. To figure out how much money his brother had at first, we need to work backwards. If his brother had $35 after spending $3 on candy, then he had $38 before buying the candy. And if his brother received $21 from Michael, then he must have had $17 to begin with. Therefore, his brother had $17 at first. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Kendy made 2 online bank transactions. She transferred $60 to her mom and half that amount to her sister. As a result, her account now has $100 left in it. How much money was in the account before the transfer?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Kendy transferred $60 to her mom. So, before the transfer, her account had $60 + $100 = $160. Next, we know that Kendy transferred half of $60, which is $30, to her sister. So, before the second transfer, her account had $160 + $30 = $190. Finally, we know that after the second transfer, Kendy had $100 left in her account. So, before the second transfer, her account had $100 + $30 = $130. Therefore, the amount of money in Kendy's account before the transfers was $130. The answer is 130.\n\n\nQ: Ivan has 20 dice. Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. How many dice do they have altogether?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Ivan has 20 dice. Next, we know that Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. So, we can multiply Ivan's number of dice by 2 to find Jerry's number of dice: 20 x 2 = 40 Therefore, Jerry has 40 dice. To find the total number of dice they have altogether, we can add Ivan's and Jerry's number of dice: 20 + 40 = 60 Therefore, they have 60 dice altogether. The answer is 60.\n\n\n"
