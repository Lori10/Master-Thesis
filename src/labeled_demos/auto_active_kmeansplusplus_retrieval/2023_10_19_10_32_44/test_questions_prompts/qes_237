  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Bingo has two dogs. On average, they walk a total of 70 miles a week. The first dog walks an average of 2 miles a day. How many miles a day does the other dog average?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many miles the first dog walks in a week. We can do this by multiplying the number of miles the dog walks in a day by the number of days in a week: 2 miles/day x 7 days/week = 14 miles/week Now we can find out how many miles the second dog walks in a week by subtracting the first dog's weekly distance from the total weekly distance: 70 miles/week - 14 miles/week = 56 miles/week Finally, we can find out how many miles the second dog walks in a day by dividing its weekly distance by the number of days in a week: 56 miles/week \u00f7 7 days/week = 8 miles/day Therefore, the second dog averages 8 miles a day. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Paul has five dogs. For every 10 pounds they weigh, they need 1 pound of dog food per day. One weighs 20 pounds. One weighs 40. Another weighs 10. One weighs 30 and the final one weighs 50 pounds. How much dog food does he need each day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total weight of all five dogs. Total weight = 20 + 40 + 10 + 30 + 50 = 150 pounds Next, we need to calculate how much dog food is needed per day for every 10 pounds of weight. 1 pound of dog food is needed for every 10 pounds of weight So, for 150 pounds of weight, we need: 150/10 = 15 pounds of dog food per day Therefore, Paul needs 15 pounds of dog food each day to feed his five dogs. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Carlos and Diego are racing around the block. Carlos runs around the entire block in 3 minutes. Diego runs around half the block in 2.5 minutes and then is tripped by a dog and can't finish. Assuming he kept up the same speed the entire race, what would've been the average time in seconds for the racers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Diego to run the entire block. Since he runs half the block in 2.5 minutes, we can use proportion to find out: 2.5 minutes = 1/2 block x minutes = 1 block Cross-multiplying, we get: 2.5 * 2 = x * 1 5 = x So it would take Diego 5 minutes to run the entire block if he hadn't been tripped. Now we can find the average time for the racers. We add up the time it took Carlos and the time it would've taken Diego, and divide by the number of racers: (3 minutes + 5 minutes) / 2 racers = 4 minutes But the question asks for the answer in seconds, so we need to convert minutes to seconds: 4 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 240 seconds So the average time for the racers would've been 240 seconds. The answer is 240.\n\n\nQ: At the zoo, there are 5 different types of animals. Seeing each animal type takes around 6 minutes. How much time would it take to see each animal type if the zoo decided to import 4 new species?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many animal types there will be in total after the zoo imports 4 new species. 5 (original animal types) + 4 (new species) = 9 (total animal types) Next, we need to find out how long it takes to see each animal type. 6 minutes per animal type x 9 animal types = 54 minutes Therefore, it would take 54 minutes to see each animal type if the zoo decided to import 4 new species. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Brandon can catch 6 squirrels or two rabbits in 1 hour. Each squirrel has 300 calories and each rabbit has 800 calories. How many more calories will he get per hour if he catches squirrels instead of rabbits?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many calories Brandon can get from catching squirrels in one hour. We know that each squirrel has 300 calories, and he can catch 6 squirrels in one hour. So, the total number of calories he can get from catching squirrels in one hour is: 300 calories/squirrel x 6 squirrels = 1800 calories Next, we need to find out how many calories Brandon can get from catching rabbits in one hour. We know that each rabbit has 800 calories, and he can catch 2 rabbits in one hour. So, the total number of calories he can get from catching rabbits in one hour is: 800 calories/rabbit x 2 rabbits = 1600 calories Finally, we need to find out how many more calories Brandon will get per hour if he catches squirrels instead of rabbits. We can do this by subtracting the number of calories he can get from catching rabbits from the number of calories he can get from catching squirrels: 1800 calories - 1600 calories = 200 calories Therefore, Brandon will get 200 more calories per hour if he catches squirrels instead of rabbits. The answer is 200.\n\n\nQ: Jenny wants to read 3 books in the next 10 days. She can read 100 words per hour. If the first book has 200 words, the second book has 400 words, and the third book has 300 words, how many minutes per day, on average, should she spend reading?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find the total number of words in all three books: 200 + 400 + 300 = 900 words Next, let's find the total number of hours it will take Jenny to read all three books: 900 words \u00f7 100 words per hour = 9 hours Now, let's find the average number of minutes per day that Jenny should spend reading: 9 hours \u00f7 10 days = 0.9 hours per day 0.9 hours per day x 60 minutes per hour = 54 minutes per day Therefore, Jenny should spend an average of 54 minutes per day reading to finish all three books in 10 days. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Joy fosters dogs.  The mom foster dog eats 1.5 cups of food, three times a day.  The puppies each eat 1/2 cup of food, twice a day.  There are 5 puppies.  How much food will Joy need for the next 6 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much food the mom foster dog eats in one day: 1.5 cups x 3 = 4.5 cups/day Next, let's calculate how much food one puppy eats in one day: 0.5 cups x 2 = 1 cup/day Since there are 5 puppies, they eat a total of: 5 x 1 = 5 cups/day To calculate how much food Joy needs for 6 days, we need to multiply the daily amount of food by 6: Mom foster dog: 4.5 cups/day x 6 days = 27 cups Puppies: 5 cups/day x 6 days = 30 cups Therefore, Joy will need a total of 27 + 30 = 57 cups of food for the next 6 days. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: A snail kite is a kind of bird that eats apple snails. On the first day, a snail kite ate 3 snails. Then it eats 2 more snails than it did the day before. How many apple snails in all did a snail kite eat for 5 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, the snail kite ate 3 snails. On the second day, it ate 2 more snails than the day before, so it ate 3 + 2 = 5 snails. On the third day, it ate 2 more snails than the day before, so it ate 5 + 2 = 7 snails. On the fourth day, it ate 2 more snails than the day before, so it ate 7 + 2 = 9 snails. On the fifth day, it ate 2 more snails than the day before, so it ate 9 + 2 = 11 snails. To find the total number of snails the snail kite ate for 5 days, we add up the number of snails it ate each day: 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 35. Therefore, the snail kite ate 35 apple snails in all for 5 days. The answer is 5.\n\n\n"
