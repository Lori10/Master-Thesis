  "test_question": "Q: Bernie has 4 dogs. They each need a certain amount of exercise per day. The first needs to walk 1 mile. The second needs to walk 4 miles. The third needs to walk 3 miles. On average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. How many miles does the last dog need?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Bingo has two dogs. On average, they walk a total of 70 miles a week. The first dog walks an average of 2 miles a day. How many miles a day does the other dog average?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many miles the first dog walks in a week. We can do this by multiplying the number of miles the dog walks in a day by the number of days in a week: 2 miles/day x 7 days/week = 14 miles/week Now we can find out how many miles the second dog walks in a week by subtracting the first dog's weekly distance from the total weekly distance: 70 miles/week - 14 miles/week = 56 miles/week Finally, we can find out how many miles the second dog walks in a day by dividing its weekly distance by the number of days in a week: 56 miles/week \u00f7 7 days/week = 8 miles/day Therefore, the second dog averages 8 miles a day. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Paul has five dogs. For every 10 pounds they weigh, they need 1 pound of dog food per day. One weighs 20 pounds. One weighs 40. Another weighs 10. One weighs 30 and the final one weighs 50 pounds. How much dog food does he need each day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total weight of all five dogs. Total weight = 20 + 40 + 10 + 30 + 50 = 150 pounds Next, we need to calculate how much dog food is needed per day for every 10 pounds of weight. 1 pound of dog food is needed for every 10 pounds of weight So, for 150 pounds of weight, we need: 150/10 = 15 pounds of dog food per day Therefore, Paul needs 15 pounds of dog food each day to feed his five dogs. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Richard starts walking from Cincinnati to New York City, which is 70 miles. Richards walks 20 miles the first day. The next day he walks 6 miles less than half as much as he walked the first day. He walks 10 miles the third day. How many miles further does Richard have to walk to be in New York City?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Richard walks 20 miles. On the second day, he walks 6 miles less than half as much as he walked the first day. Half of what he walked on the first day is 20/2 = 10 miles. So, he walks 10 - 6 = 4 miles on the second day. On the third day, he walks 10 miles. Therefore, the total distance Richard has walked so far is 20 + 4 + 10 = 34 miles. To reach New York City, which is 70 miles away, Richard still has to walk 70 - 34 = 36 miles further. The answer is 36.\n\n\nQ: Every Monday to Friday morning, Alice walks 10 miles through a large grass field to get to school. To avoid the hot afternoon sun on her way home, she walks 12 miles through a forest. When she gets home on Friday, how many miles will she have walked that week?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. Alice walks 10 miles every morning from Monday to Friday. So, in total, she walks 10 x 5 = 50 miles during the weekdays. On her way back home, she walks 12 miles every afternoon from Monday to Friday. So, in total, she walks 12 x 5 = 60 miles during the weekdays. Therefore, the total distance Alice walks during the weekdays is 50 + 60 = 110 miles. Since the problem asks for the total distance Alice walks in a week, we need to add the distance she walks on Saturday and Sunday as well. Let's assume Alice doesn't walk to school on weekends. So, the total distance she walks on weekends is 0. Therefore, the total distance Alice walks in a week is 110 + 0 + 0 = 110 miles. The answer is 110.\n\n\nQ: Billy and Tiffany are having a contest to see how can run the most miles in a week. On Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, Billy runs 1 mile each day and Tiffany runs 2 miles each day. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, Billy runs 1 mile each day and Tiffany runs a 1/3 of a mile each day. On Saturday Tiffany assumes she's going to win and takes the day off. How many miles does Billy have to run on Saturday to tie Tiffany?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how many miles Billy and Tiffany run from Sunday to Friday: Billy: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 miles Tiffany: 2 + 2 + 2 + 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 6 2/3 miles So, by Friday, Tiffany is ahead by 2/3 of a mile. To tie Tiffany, Billy needs to run 2/3 of a mile on Saturday. Therefore, Billy needs to run 0.67 miles on Saturday to tie Tiffany. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Eliana walked 200 steps for her morning exercise, did some press-ups, then added some 300 more steps to her count for the first day. The next day, she walked twice the number of steps she walked on the first day.  And on the third day, Eliana walked an additional 100 steps. What's the total number of steps Eliana walked during these three days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Eliana walked 200 + 300 = 500 steps. On the second day, she walked twice the number of steps she walked on the first day, which is 2 * 500 = 1000 steps. On the third day, she walked an additional 100 steps. Therefore, the total number of steps Eliana walked during these three days is 500 + 1000 + 100 = 1600 steps. The answer is 1600.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Charlie can make 5350 steps while running on a 3-kilometer running field. If he can run around the field 2 1/2 times during a running session, how many steps was he able to make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many steps Charlie takes per kilometer. To do this, we can divide the total number of steps (5350) by the distance he runs (3 kilometers): 5350 steps \u00f7 3 kilometers = 1783.33 steps/kilometer Next, we need to find out how far Charlie runs during one lap around the field. We know that he runs around the field 2 1/2 times, which is the same as 2.5 laps. Since the field is 3 kilometers long, one lap around the field is: 3 kilometers/lap So, 2.5 laps around the field is: 2.5 laps x 3 kilometers/lap = 7.5 kilometers Finally, we can use the steps per kilometer ratio we found earlier to calculate how many steps Charlie takes during 7.5 kilometers: 1783.33 steps/kilometer x 7.5 kilometers = 13375 steps Therefore, Charlie was able to make 13375 steps during his running session. The answer is 13375.\n\n\n"
