  "test_question": "Q: Two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies. Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. How many cups of flour will Carla need to bake the cookies today and tomorrow?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Valerie\u2019s cookie recipe makes 16 dozen cookies and calls for 4 pounds of butter.  She only wants to make 4 dozen cookies for the weekend.  How many pounds of butter will she need?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cookies Valerie needs to make for the weekend. Since she only wants to make 4 dozen cookies, we can calculate that as: 4 dozen cookies = 4 x 12 = 48 cookies Next, we need to figure out how much butter is needed for 16 dozen cookies. If 16 dozen cookies require 4 pounds of butter, we can set up a proportion: 16 dozen cookies / 4 pounds of butter = 1 dozen cookies / x pounds of butter To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 16 dozen cookies * x pounds of butter = 4 pounds of butter * 1 dozen cookies 16x = 48 x = 3 Therefore, Valerie will need 3 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen cookies for the weekend. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Claire wants to make 2 cakes for her mother. Two packages of flour are required for making a cake. If 1 package of flour is $3, how much does she pay for the flour that is enough to make 2 cakes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine how many packages of flour Claire needs to make 2 cakes. Since 2 packages of flour are required for making 1 cake, Claire needs 2 x 2 = 4 packages of flour to make 2 cakes. Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the flour. Since 1 package of flour costs $3, 4 packages of flour will cost 4 x $3 = $12. Therefore, Claire will pay $12 for the flour that is enough to make 2 cakes. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Carl has a goal of selling 96 cupcakes in 2 days. Carl needs to give 24 cupcakes to Bonnie as payment for using her storefront. How many cupcakes must Carl sell per day to reach his goal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to subtract the 24 cupcakes that Carl needs to give to Bonnie from his goal of selling 96 cupcakes. 96 - 24 = 72 So Carl needs to sell 72 cupcakes in 2 days. To find out how many cupcakes he needs to sell per day, we can divide 72 by 2: 72 \u00f7 2 = 36 Therefore, Carl needs to sell 36 cupcakes per day to reach his goal of selling 96 cupcakes in 2 days, after giving 24 cupcakes to Bonnie. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Dante needs half as many cups of flour to bake his chocolate cake as he needs eggs. If he uses 60 eggs in his recipe, calculate the total number of cups of flour and eggs that he uses altogether.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cups of flour Dante needs. We know that he needs half as many cups of flour as he needs eggs. So, if he needs 60 eggs, he needs half as many cups of flour, which is 60/2 = 30 cups of flour. Next, we need to calculate the total number of cups of flour and eggs that Dante uses altogether. Dante uses 60 eggs and 30 cups of flour, so the total number of cups of flour and eggs that he uses altogether is 60 + 30 = 90. Therefore, Dante uses a total of 90 cups of flour and eggs altogether in his recipe. The answer is 90.\n\n\nQ: Traci and Harris are baking cakes together. Traci has brought flour from her own house and Harris has 400g of flour in his house. Each cake needs 100g of flour and Traci and Harris have created 9 cakes each. How much flour, in grams, did Traci bring from her own house?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much flour they have in total. Harris has 400g of flour and Traci brought some from her own house, so we can represent the total amount of flour as: Total flour = 400g + Traci's flour Next, we need to find out how much flour they used in total. They made 9 cakes each, and each cake needs 100g of flour, so the total amount of flour used is: Total flour used = 9 cakes x 100g/cake x 2 people = 1800g Now we can set up an equation to solve for Traci's flour: Total flour = 400g + Traci's flour Traci's flour = Total flour - 400g We know that the total flour used is 1800g, so we can substitute that in: Traci's flour = 1800g - 400g Traci's flour = 1400g Therefore, Traci brought 1400g of flour from her own house. The answer is 1400.\n\n\nQ: Mary wants 144 cupcakes for her party. Mary has already made 36 cherry cupcakes, and 48 berry cupcakes. Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes for the rest. How much of each should she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Mary has already made: 36 cherry + 48 berry = 84 cupcakes Next, we need to figure out how many more cupcakes Mary needs to make: 144 total cupcakes - 84 cupcakes already made = 60 cupcakes Since Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, we can divide the remaining 60 cupcakes by 2: 60 cupcakes \u00f7 2 = 30 cupcakes of each flavor Therefore, Mary should make 30 chocolate cupcakes and 30 vanilla cupcakes to have a total of 144 cupcakes for her party. The answer is 144.\n\n\nQ: Brenda volunteered to make 3 trays of banana pudding for the family reunion.  Each tray of banana pudding would need 80 wafer cookies.  A box of wafer cookies only had 60 cookies per box.  Each box costs $3.50.  How much will it cost her to buy just enough boxes for 3 trays of banana pudding?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many wafer cookies Brenda needs in total. She needs 80 cookies per tray and she's making 3 trays, so she needs: 80 x 3 = 240 wafer cookies Next, we need to figure out how many boxes of cookies she needs to buy. Each box has 60 cookies, so we can divide the total number of cookies needed by the number of cookies per box: 240 \u00f7 60 = 4 boxes So Brenda needs to buy 4 boxes of cookies. Each box costs $3.50, so we can multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box: 4 x $3.50 = $14 Therefore, it will cost Brenda $14 to buy just enough boxes for 3 trays of banana pudding. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: When Michelle makes fresh pasta, she first makes the dough, then she rolls it out and cuts it, and then she hangs it on racks to dry for cooking later. She needs a drying rack for each three pounds of pasta she makes, and it takes two cups of flour to make each pound of pasta dough. She owns three racks right now. How many more drying racks will Michelle need if she makes pasta using three 8-cup bags of flour?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pounds of pasta dough Michelle will make using three 8-cup bags of flour. Since it takes 2 cups of flour to make 1 pound of pasta dough, three 8-cup bags of flour will make: 3 x 8 = 24 cups of flour And since it takes 2 cups of flour to make 1 pound of pasta dough, 24 cups of flour will make: 24 / 2 = 12 pounds of pasta dough Next, we need to find out how many drying racks Michelle will need for 12 pounds of pasta dough. Michelle needs 1 drying rack for every 3 pounds of pasta dough, so for 12 pounds of pasta dough, she will need: 12 / 3 = 4 drying racks Michelle currently owns 3 drying racks, so she will need: 4 - 3 = 1 more drying rack Therefore, Michelle will need 1 more drying rack if she makes pasta using three 8-cup bags of flour. The answer is 8.\n\n\n"
