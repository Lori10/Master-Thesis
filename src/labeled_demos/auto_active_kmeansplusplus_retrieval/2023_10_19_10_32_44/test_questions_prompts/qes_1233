  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Betty bought 1 kg of oranges and 3 kg of apples. The total cost of oranges was $12. The apples were two times cheaper than the oranges. How much did Betty pay for 1 kg of apples?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the total cost of oranges was $12. We don't know the cost per kilogram of oranges, but we can figure it out by dividing the total cost by the amount of oranges Betty bought: Cost per kilogram of oranges = $12 \u00f7 1 kg = $12/kg Next, we know that the apples were two times cheaper than the oranges. This means that the cost per kilogram of apples is half the cost per kilogram of oranges: Cost per kilogram of apples = 1/2 \u00d7 $12/kg = $6/kg Therefore, Betty paid $6 for 1 kg of apples. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Joseph has a refrigerator, a water heater in his house, and an electric oven that consumes power at different rates. The total amount of money that Joseph pays for the energy used by the refrigerator is three times the amount he pays for the power used by the water heater. If the electric oven uses power worth $500 in a month, twice what Joseph pays for the power the water heater uses, calculate the total amount he pays for the power used by these gadgets.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much Joseph pays for the power used by the water heater. We know that the electric oven uses power worth $500 in a month, twice what Joseph pays for the power the water heater uses. So, if the power used by the water heater is x, then we can write: 2x = $500 Solving for x, we get: x = $250 Now we know that Joseph pays $250 for the power used by the water heater. We also know that the total amount of money that Joseph pays for the energy used by the refrigerator is three times the amount he pays for the power used by the water heater. So, if the power used by the water heater is x, then the power used by the refrigerator is 3x. Therefore, the total amount Joseph pays for the power used by these gadgets is: $250 + $500 + 3x Substituting x = $250, we get: $250 + $500 + 3($250) = $1,500 Therefore, Joseph pays a total of $1,500 for the power used by the refrigerator, water heater, and electric oven. The answer is 1500.\n\n\nQ: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of 18 watermelons. Since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, the total weight of 18 watermelons would be: 23 x 18 = 414 pounds Next, we need to find the total amount of money Farmer Kent would make by selling these watermelons. Since he sells them for $2 a pound, we can multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 414 x $2 = $828 Therefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: A charcoal grill burns fifteen coals to ash every twenty minutes of grilling. The grill ran for long enough to burn three bags of coals. Each bag of coal contains 60 coals. How long did the grill run?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many coals were burned in total. Since each bag contains 60 coals, and there were three bags, the total number of coals burned is: 60 coals/bag * 3 bags = 180 coals Next, we need to figure out how many sets of 15 coals were burned. We can do this by dividing the total number of coals burned by 15: 180 coals / 15 coals/set = 12 sets So, the grill burned 15 coals every 20 minutes, and it burned 12 sets of 15 coals, which means it ran for: 12 sets * 20 minutes/set = 240 minutes Therefore, the grill ran for 240 minutes or 4 hours. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Harris feeds his dog 1 large organic carrot over the course of 1 day.  There are 5 carrots in a 1 pound bag and each bag costs $2.00.  In one year, how much will Harris spend on carrots?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many pounds of carrots Harris will need in a year. Since he feeds his dog 1 carrot per day, he will need 365 carrots in a year. Next, we need to figure out how many bags of carrots he will need. If there are 5 carrots in a bag, then he will need 365/5 = 73 bags of carrots in a year. Finally, we can calculate the cost of the carrots. Each bag costs $2.00, so 73 bags will cost 73 x $2.00 = $146.00. Therefore, Harris will spend $146.00 on carrots in one year. The answer is 146.\n\n\nQ: To buy a book, you pay $20 for each of the first 5 books at the supermarket, and for each additional book you buy over $20, you receive a discount of $2. If Beatrice bought 20 books, how much did she pay at the supermarket?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the first 5 books, which is simply: $20 x 5 = $100 Next, we need to calculate the cost of the remaining 15 books. Since Beatrice gets a $2 discount for each book over $20, we can calculate the cost of each book as: $20 - $2 = $18 Therefore, the cost of the remaining 15 books is: $18 x 15 = $270 Finally, we can calculate the total cost by adding the cost of the first 5 books to the cost of the remaining 15 books: $100 + $270 = $370 Therefore, Beatrice paid $370 at the supermarket for 20 books. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: A bag of dozen apples costs $14 and Brian has already spent $10 on kiwis and half that much on bananas. What's the maximum number of apples Brian can buy if he left his house with only $50 and needs to pay the $3.50 subway fare each way?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much money Brian has left after paying for the subway fare. He needs to pay $3.50 each way, so that's a total of $7 for the round trip. Therefore, he has $50 - $7 = $43 left to spend on groceries. Next, we need to figure out how much money Brian has already spent on bananas. We know he spent half as much on bananas as he did on kiwis, and he spent $10 on kiwis. So he spent $10 / 2 = $5 on bananas. Now we can subtract the amount Brian has already spent on kiwis and bananas from the total amount he has left to spend on groceries: $43 - $10 - $5 = $28. Finally, we need to figure out how many bags of apples Brian can buy with $28. We know that one bag of apples costs $14, so we can divide $28 by $14 to get the maximum number of bags of apples Brian can buy: $28 / $14 = 2. Therefore, the maximum number of bags of apples Brian can buy is 2. Since each bag contains a dozen apples, he can buy a total of 2 x 12 = 24 apples. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Claire wants to make 2 cakes for her mother. Two packages of flour are required for making a cake. If 1 package of flour is $3, how much does she pay for the flour that is enough to make 2 cakes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine how many packages of flour Claire needs to make 2 cakes. Since 2 packages of flour are required for making 1 cake, Claire needs 2 x 2 = 4 packages of flour to make 2 cakes. Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the flour. Since 1 package of flour costs $3, 4 packages of flour will cost 4 x $3 = $12. Therefore, Claire will pay $12 for the flour that is enough to make 2 cakes. The answer is 2.\n\n\n"
