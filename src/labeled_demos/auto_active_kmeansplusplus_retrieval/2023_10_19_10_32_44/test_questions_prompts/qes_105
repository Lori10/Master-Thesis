  "formatted_prompt": "Q: June made a design with 20 equal tiles. Three tiles are yellow and the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles. Six tiles are purple and the remaining tiles are white.  How many white tiles are there?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 3 yellow tiles. Next, we know that the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles, so there are 3+1=4 blue tiles. Then, we know that there are 6 purple tiles. So far, we have accounted for 3+4+6=13 tiles. Since there are 20 tiles in total, we can subtract 13 from 20 to find the number of white tiles: 20-13=7 Therefore, there are 7 white tiles in June's design. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Don can paint 3 tiles a minute, Ken can paint 2 more tiles a minute than Don and Laura can paint twice as many tiles as Ken. Kim can paint 3 fewer tiles than Laura can in a minute. How many tiles can Don, Ken, Laura and Kim paint in 15 minutes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many tiles each person can paint in one minute. Don can paint 3 tiles a minute. Ken can paint 2 more tiles a minute than Don, so Ken can paint 3 + 2 = 5 tiles a minute. Laura can paint twice as many tiles as Ken, so Laura can paint 5 x 2 = 10 tiles a minute. Kim can paint 3 fewer tiles than Laura can in a minute, so Kim can paint 10 - 3 = 7 tiles a minute. Now that we know how many tiles each person can paint in one minute, we can multiply that by 15 to find out how many tiles they can paint in 15 minutes. Don can paint 3 x 15 = 45 tiles in 15 minutes. Ken can paint 5 x 15 = 75 tiles in 15 minutes. Laura can paint 10 x 15 = 150 tiles in 15 minutes. Kim can paint 7 x 15 = 105 tiles in 15 minutes. Therefore, Don can paint 45 tiles, Ken can paint 75 tiles, Laura can paint 150 tiles, and Kim can paint 105 tiles in 15 minutes. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Gerald is a furniture maker. He has 672 pieces of wood and he wants to make some tables and chairs. It takes 12 pieces of wood to make a table and 8 pieces of wood to make a chair. How many chairs can he make if he makes 24 tables?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many pieces of wood Gerald will use to make 24 tables. To make one table, he needs 12 pieces of wood. So to make 24 tables, he will need: 12 x 24 = 288 pieces of wood Now, let's subtract the pieces of wood used for the tables from the total number of pieces of wood Gerald has: 672 - 288 = 384 pieces of wood left Finally, let's find out how many chairs Gerald can make with the remaining pieces of wood. To make one chair, he needs 8 pieces of wood. So the number of chairs he can make is: 384 \u00f7 8 = 48 chairs Therefore, Gerald can make 48 chairs if he makes 24 tables. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Marla has a grid of squares that has 10 rows and 15 squares in each row. She colors 4 rows of 6 squares in the middle of the grid with red. She colors all squares on the first 2 and last 2 rows with blue. Then she colors the rest with green. How many squares does Marla color green?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of squares in the grid. We can do this by multiplying the number of rows by the number of squares in each row: 10 rows x 15 squares/row = 150 squares Next, we need to find the number of squares that Marla colors red. She colors 4 rows of 6 squares each, so: 4 rows x 6 squares/row = 24 squares Now we need to find the number of squares that Marla colors blue. She colors the first 2 and last 2 rows, which means she colors a total of: 2 rows x 15 squares/row + 2 rows x 15 squares/row = 60 squares Finally, we can subtract the number of red and blue squares from the total number of squares to find the number of green squares: 150 total squares - 24 red squares - 60 blue squares = 66 green squares Therefore, Marla colors 66 squares green. The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: Betsy is sewing a quilt.  The quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side.  Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together.  How many more squares does she need to sew together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many squares Betsy has already sewn together. If the quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side, then the total number of squares in the quilt is: 16 x 16 = 256 squares If Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together, then she has sewn: 0.25 x 256 = 64 squares Now we need to find out how many more squares she needs to sew together. To do this, we can subtract the number of squares she has already sewn from the total number of squares in the quilt: 256 - 64 = 192 squares So Betsy still needs to sew together 192 squares to complete the quilt. The answer is 192.\n\n\nQ: If a rectangle has a width of 42 inches and an area of 1638, how many rectangles of the same size would reach a length of 390 inches?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length of the rectangle with a width of 42 inches and an area of 1638. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width. Area = length x width 1638 = length x 42 Dividing both sides by 42: length = 1638/42 length = 39 So the length of the rectangle is 39 inches. Next, we need to find how many of these rectangles with a length of 39 inches can fit into a length of 390 inches. We can divide the total length by the length of one rectangle: 390/39 = 10 So 10 rectangles of the same size would reach a length of 390 inches. The answer is 390.\n\n\nQ: John takes a 10-minute shower every other day for 4 weeks. If his shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute.  How much water does he use in those 4 weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many showers John takes in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks is 4 x 7 = 28 days. Since John takes a shower every other day, he takes 28/2 = 14 showers in 4 weeks. Next, we need to find out how much water he uses per shower. John takes a 10-minute shower, and his shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute. So, he uses 10 x 2 = 20 gallons of water per shower. Finally, we can find out how much water he uses in 4 weeks by multiplying the amount of water per shower by the number of showers he takes: 20 gallons per shower x 14 showers = 280 gallons of water in 4 weeks. Therefore, John uses 280 gallons of water in those 4 weeks. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Jerry is sweeping up pieces of broken glass in the parking lot. He sweeps up 20 amber pieces, 35 green pieces, and some clear pieces. If the green pieces are 25% of the total glass he sweeps up, how many pieces were clear?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the green pieces are 25% of the total glass, so we can set up an equation: 35 = 0.25x where x is the total number of pieces of glass Jerry sweeps up. We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.25: x = 140 So Jerry sweeps up a total of 140 pieces of glass. We also know that he sweeps up 20 amber pieces and 35 green pieces, so the number of clear pieces must be: 140 - 20 - 35 = 85 Therefore, Jerry swept up 85 clear pieces of glass. The answer is 85.\n\n\n"
