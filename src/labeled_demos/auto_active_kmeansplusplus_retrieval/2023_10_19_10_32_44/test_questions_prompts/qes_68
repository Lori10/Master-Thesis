  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Carson runs a carpool for five of his friends. The five of them cover all the gas expenses to compensate Carson for his time. Their total commute is 21 miles one way, gas costs $2.50/gallon, Carson's car gets 30 miles/gallon, and they commute to work 5 days a week, 4 weeks a month. How much does each person pay toward gas monthly?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per day. Since they commute 21 miles one way, their round trip is 21 x 2 = 42 miles. Next, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per week. They commute 42 miles per day, and they commute 5 days a week, so they commute 42 x 5 = 210 miles per week. Then, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per month. They commute 210 miles per week, and they commute 4 weeks a month, so they commute 210 x 4 = 840 miles per month. Now, we need to find out how many gallons of gas they need per month. Carson's car gets 30 miles per gallon, and they commute 840 miles per month, so they need 840/30 = 28 gallons of gas per month. Finally, we need to find out how much each person pays toward gas monthly. The total cost of gas is $2.50 per gallon, and they need 28 gallons of gas per month, so the total cost of gas is 2.5 x 28 = $70 per month. Since there are 6 people in the carpool (Carson and his 5 friends), each person pays 70/6 = $11.67 toward gas monthly. The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: James gets paid $0.50/mile to drive a truck carrying hazardous waste. He has to pay $4.00/gallon for gas and his truck gets 20 miles per gallon. How much profit does he make from a 600 mile trip?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how many gallons of gas James will need for the trip. To do this, we divide the total distance by the truck's gas mileage: 600 miles \u00f7 20 miles per gallon = 30 gallons of gas Next, we need to calculate how much James will spend on gas: 30 gallons x $4.00 per gallon = $120.00 Now we can calculate how much James will earn from the trip: 600 miles x $0.50 per mile = $300.00 Finally, we can calculate James' profit by subtracting the cost of gas from his earnings: $300.00 - $120.00 = $180.00 Therefore, James will make a profit of $180.00 from a 600 mile trip. The answer is 600.\n\n\nQ: Tara's taking a road trip for the weekend.  She drives for two days, stopping to fill up her gas tank each time from empty to full when she needs it.  She visits 4 different gas stations in total, with the price of gas being $3, $3.50, $4, and $4.50 respectively at each.  If Tara's car has a 12-gallon tank, how much does she spend on gas for her road trip?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how much gas Tara needs to fill up her 12-gallon tank each time. To do this, we can simply multiply 12 by 1, since she is filling up from empty to full each time. So, Tara needs 12 gallons of gas at each of the 4 gas stations she visits. Next, we need to calculate how much she spends at each gas station. At the first gas station, where gas is $3 per gallon, Tara spends 12 x 3 = $36. At the second gas station, where gas is $3.50 per gallon, Tara spends 12 x 3.5 = $42. At the third gas station, where gas is $4 per gallon, Tara spends 12 x 4 = $48. And finally, at the fourth gas station, where gas is $4.50 per gallon, Tara spends 12 x 4.5 = $54. To find the total amount Tara spends on gas for her road trip, we simply add up the amounts she spent at each gas station: $36 + $42 + $48 + $54 = $180 Therefore, Tara spends $180 on gas for her road trip. The answer is 180.\n\n\nQ: Mr. Maxwell takes 1 hr to drive to work in the morning but 1 and half hours to drive back home in the evening. If the morning and evening traffic is similar and he drives at an average speed of 30mph in the morning, what is the average speed of his return journey?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time Since Mr. Maxwell drives at an average speed of 30mph in the morning and takes 1 hour to drive to work, we can calculate the distance he travels in the morning as: distance = 30 x 1 = 30 miles Now, we know that the distance he travels in the evening is the same as the distance he travels in the morning (assuming he takes the same route). So, we can use the formula again to find his average speed in the evening: speed = distance / time We know the distance is 30 miles, but we need to find the time it takes him to drive back home. We're told that it takes him 1 and a half hours, which we can also write as 1.5 hours. Therefore, his average speed in the evening is: speed = 30 / 1.5 = 20 mph So, the average speed of his return journey is 20 mph. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Maddie wants to see how much her mom spends on coffee each week. She makes herself 2 cups of coffee per day. Each cup has 1.5 ounces of coffee beans. A bag of coffee costs $8 and contains 10.5 ounces of beans. She uses 1/2 a gallon of milk per week. A gallon of milk costs $4. She doesn't add any sugar to the coffee. How much does she spend on her coffee per week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many ounces of coffee beans Maddie uses per week. She makes 2 cups of coffee per day, so that's 2 x 7 = 14 cups per week. Each cup has 1.5 ounces of coffee beans, so she uses 1.5 x 14 = 21 ounces of coffee beans per week. Next, we need to figure out how many bags of coffee she needs to buy. Each bag of coffee has 10.5 ounces of beans, so she needs 21 / 10.5 = 2 bags of coffee per week. Two bags of coffee cost $8 each, so she spends 2 x $8 = $16 on coffee per week. Finally, we need to calculate the cost of milk. She uses 1/2 a gallon of milk per week, which costs $4 per gallon. So, she spends 1/2 x $4 = $2 on milk per week. Adding the cost of coffee and milk, Maddie spends $16 + $2 = $18 on her coffee per week. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Every Monday to Friday morning, Alice walks 10 miles through a large grass field to get to school. To avoid the hot afternoon sun on her way home, she walks 12 miles through a forest. When she gets home on Friday, how many miles will she have walked that week?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. Alice walks 10 miles every morning from Monday to Friday. So, in total, she walks 10 x 5 = 50 miles during the weekdays. On her way back home, she walks 12 miles every afternoon from Monday to Friday. So, in total, she walks 12 x 5 = 60 miles during the weekdays. Therefore, the total distance Alice walks during the weekdays is 50 + 60 = 110 miles. Since the problem asks for the total distance Alice walks in a week, we need to add the distance she walks on Saturday and Sunday as well. Let's assume Alice doesn't walk to school on weekends. So, the total distance she walks on weekends is 0. Therefore, the total distance Alice walks in a week is 110 + 0 + 0 = 110 miles. The answer is 110.\n\n\nQ: Briar is attending a one-week community empowerment event and has to take a cab ride to the event and back home every day. A cab ride costs $2.5 per mile. If the event is 200 miles away from Briar's home, calculate the total amount of money the cab rides cost would be at the end of the event?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total distance Briar will travel during the event. Since Briar has to travel to the event and back home every day, the total distance he will travel in a day is 2 times the distance between his home and the event, which is 2*200 = 400 miles. Next, we need to calculate the total distance Briar will travel during the entire event, which is 400 miles per day multiplied by the number of days in the event. If the event is one week long, then the number of days is 7. Therefore, the total distance Briar will travel during the event is 400*7 = 2800 miles. Finally, we can calculate the total cost of the cab rides by multiplying the total distance by the cost per mile. The cost per mile is $2.5, so the total cost of the cab rides is 2800*$2.5 = $7000. Therefore, the total amount of money the cab rides cost would be at the end of the event is $7000. The answer is 7000.\n\n\nQ: Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how much money Carl will earn in four weeks. If he earns $0.50 every time, and he buys a candy bar each time, that means he's spending $0.50 each week. But he's also earning $0.75 each week for taking out his neighbor's trash. So his net earnings each week are $0.75 - $0.50 = $0.25. Over four weeks, that's a total of $0.25 x 4 = $1. So Carl will have $1 to spend on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.50, he can buy 2 candy bars with his earnings. The answer is 2.\n\n\n"
