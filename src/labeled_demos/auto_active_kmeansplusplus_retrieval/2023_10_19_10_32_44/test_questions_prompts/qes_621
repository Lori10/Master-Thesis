  "test_question": "Q: The book is printed on paper that, when stacked, is 100 pages to the inch. Each paper is printed on both sides, with one page of the book printed on each side. How many pages are in the book, if it is 1.5 inches thick?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Stacy bought two packs of printer paper for the office. Each pack has 240 sheets of paper. Her office prints 80 one-page documents per day. How many days will the printer paper last her office?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many sheets of paper Stacy bought in total. Since she bought two packs, each with 240 sheets, we can multiply 2 by 240 to get: 2 x 240 = 480 So Stacy bought 480 sheets of paper in total. Next, we need to figure out how many pages her office prints per day. We know they print 80 one-page documents per day, so that means they print: 80 x 1 = 80 pages per day Now we can use this information to figure out how many days the paper will last. We can divide the total number of sheets by the number of pages printed per day: 480 / 80 = 6 So the printer paper will last Stacy's office 6 days. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour. Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour.  Oliver can read 40 pages.  How many pages can Carter read in 1 hour?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Oliver can read 40 pages in 1 hour. Next, we know that Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour, so Lucy can read 40 + 20 = 60 pages in 1 hour. Finally, we know that Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour, so Carter can read 60 / 2 = 30 pages in 1 hour. Therefore, Carter can read 30 pages in 1 hour. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: A library has a number of books. 35% of them are intended for children and 104 of them are for adults. How many books are in the library?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 35% of the books are intended for children. This means that 65% of the books are intended for adults. We also know that there are 104 books intended for adults. To find the total number of books in the library, we can set up a proportion: 65/100 = 104/x We can cross-multiply to solve for x: 65x = 10400 x = 160 Therefore, there are 160 books in the library. The answer is 160.\n\n\nQ: Adam has just bought some new books so he has decided to clean up his bookcase. After he adds his new books to his bookshelf he realizes that he has bought enough books to finish completely filling his bookcase with 2 books left over. Before his shopping trip, Adam had 56 books in his bookcase. If his bookcase has 4 shelves and averages 20 books per shelf, how many books did Adam buy on his shopping trip?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many books can fit on Adam's bookcase. We know that he has 4 shelves and each shelf can hold an average of 20 books, so the total capacity of his bookcase is: 4 shelves x 20 books per shelf = 80 books Next, we need to figure out how many books Adam had before his shopping trip. We know that he had 56 books in his bookcase before he bought any new books. Now, we can use the information given in the problem to figure out how many books Adam bought on his shopping trip. We know that he bought enough books to completely fill his bookcase with 2 books left over. This means that he bought: 80 books - 2 books left over = 78 books Therefore, Adam bought 78 books on his shopping trip. The answer is 78.\n\n\nQ: Billy has 8 hours of free time on each day of the weekend. He wants to spend 75% of his time playing video games and the rest of his time reading. He can read 60 pages an hour and his books all contain 80 pages. How many books does he read?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts. First, we need to find out how much time Billy spends playing video games and how much time he spends reading. He has 8 hours of free time on each day of the weekend, so that's a total of 16 hours for the entire weekend. If he wants to spend 75% of his time playing video games, that means he will spend 0.75 x 16 = 12 hours playing video games. The rest of his time will be spent reading, which is 16 - 12 = 4 hours. Next, we need to find out how many pages he can read in 1 hour. We know that he can read 60 pages an hour, so that's 60 pages/hour. Finally, we need to find out how many books he can read in 4 hours. Each book contains 80 pages, so he can read 60/80 = 0.75 of a book in 1 hour. In 4 hours, he can read 4 x 0.75 = 3 books. Therefore, Billy can read 3 books during his free time on the weekend. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Enrique has 2 132 contracts that he needs to shred.  His paper shredder will only allow him to shred 6 pages at a time.  How many times will he shred 6 units of paper until all of the contracts are shredded?\nA: Let's think step by step. Enrique has 2 contracts, each with 132 pages. So, he has a total of 2 x 132 = 264 pages to shred. Enrique can shred 6 pages at a time. To find out how many times he needs to shred 6 pages to shred all 264 pages, we can divide 264 by 6: 264 \u00f7 6 = 44 So, Enrique will need to shred 6 pages 44 times to shred all 264 pages. The answer is 264.\n\n\nQ: Alyssa took 100 photos on vacation. She wants to put them in a photo album with 30 pages. She can place 3 photos each on the first 10 pages. Then she can place 4 photos each on the next 10 pages. If she wants to put an equal number of photos on each of the remaining pages of the album, how many photos can she place on each page?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Alyssa can place 3 photos each on the first 10 pages, which means she has used 3 x 10 = 30 photos. Then, she can place 4 photos each on the next 10 pages, which means she has used 4 x 10 = 40 photos. So far, she has used 30 + 40 = 70 photos. She has 100 - 70 = 30 photos left to place in the remaining pages. Since she wants to put an equal number of photos on each of the remaining pages, she can divide the remaining photos by the number of remaining pages: 30 \u00f7 10 = 3. Therefore, Alyssa can place 3 photos on each of the remaining 10 pages. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Jenny wants to read 3 books in the next 10 days. She can read 100 words per hour. If the first book has 200 words, the second book has 400 words, and the third book has 300 words, how many minutes per day, on average, should she spend reading?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find the total number of words in all three books: 200 + 400 + 300 = 900 words Next, let's find the total number of hours it will take Jenny to read all three books: 900 words \u00f7 100 words per hour = 9 hours Now, let's find the average number of minutes per day that Jenny should spend reading: 9 hours \u00f7 10 days = 0.9 hours per day 0.9 hours per day x 60 minutes per hour = 54 minutes per day Therefore, Jenny should spend an average of 54 minutes per day reading to finish all three books in 10 days. The answer is 10.\n\n\n"
