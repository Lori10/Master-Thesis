  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Stephanie is decorating 24 cupcakes for a birthday party, but she needs more candles. She currently has a total of 30 candles. She wants to decorate half of the cupcakes with 1 candle each and the other half of the cupcakes with 2 candles each. How many additional candles does Stephanie need to complete the cupcakes?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that Stephanie is decorating 24 cupcakes in total. Step 2: She wants to decorate half of the cupcakes with 1 candle each, which means she needs 12 candles for those cupcakes (12 cupcakes x 1 candle each = 12 candles). Step 3: She wants to decorate the other half of the cupcakes with 2 candles each, which means she needs 24 candles for those cupcakes (12 cupcakes x 2 candles each = 24 candles). Step 4: In total, she needs 36 candles (30 candles she already has + 12 candles for the first half of cupcakes + 24 candles for the second half of cupcakes = 66 candles). Step 5: To complete the cupcakes, Stephanie needs 6 more candles (36 candles needed - 30 candles she already has = 6 candles). The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Five people are planning a party. Sonja will buy a loaf of French bread ($3 a loaf) and a platter of cold cuts ($23). Barbara will buy the soda ($1 per person) and two boxes of crackers ($2 per box). Mario and Rick will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles ($3 per package). Danica will supply a package of paper plates for $4. How much more will Sonja spend than the rest of the office put together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of Barbara's contribution. She will buy soda for 5 people, which will cost $5 (1 dollar per person). She will also buy two boxes of crackers, which will cost $4 (2 dollars per box). Therefore, Barbara's total contribution will be $9. Next, let's calculate the total cost of Mario and Rick's contribution. They will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles, which will cost $6 in total (3 dollars per package). Now, let's add up the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's. Barbara's contribution is $9, Mario and Rick's contribution is $6, and Danica's contribution is $4. Therefore, the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's is $19. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of Sonja's contribution. She will buy a loaf of French bread for $3 and a platter of cold cuts for $23. Therefore, Sonja's total contribution will be $26. To find out how much more Sonja will spend than the rest of the office put together, we need to subtract the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's from Sonja's total contribution. $26 (Sonja's contribution) - $19 (total cost of everyone else's contribution) = $7 Therefore, Sonja will spend $7 more than the rest of the office put together. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Tonya is buying Christmas gifts for her sisters. She has 2 sisters and wants to spend the exact same amount on each. She buys her younger sister 4 dolls that cost $15 each. She plans to buy lego sets for her older sister. They cost $20 each. How many lego sets does she buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much Tonya spent on dolls for her younger sister. She bought 4 dolls that cost $15 each, so she spent: 4 x $15 = $60 Since Tonya wants to spend the same amount on each sister, she needs to spend $60 on lego sets for her older sister as well. Each lego set costs $20, so she needs to buy: $60 \u00f7 $20 = 3 lego sets Therefore, Tonya needs to buy 3 lego sets for her older sister. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Jamie and Oliver are planning to go on a vacation. A plane ticket costs $24 for each person and a hotel stay costs $12 for each person per day. How much money will they spend on the vacation if they stay for 3 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets for both Jamie and Oliver. Since each ticket costs $24, the total cost of the tickets will be: $24 x 2 = $48 Next, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel stay. Since the cost is $12 per person per day, and they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel stay will be: $12 x 2 x 3 = $72 Finally, we need to add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay to get the total cost of the vacation: $48 + $72 = $120 Therefore, Jamie and Oliver will spend $120 on their vacation. The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: Michael has $42. Michael gives away half the money to his brother. His brother then buys 3 dollars worth of candy. If his brother has $35 left, how much money, in dollars, did his brother have at first?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Michael had $42. Next, he gave away half of that money to his brother, which is $21. His brother then spent $3 on candy, leaving him with $35. To figure out how much money his brother had at first, we need to work backwards. If his brother had $35 after spending $3 on candy, then he had $38 before buying the candy. And if his brother received $21 from Michael, then he must have had $17 to begin with. Therefore, his brother had $17 at first. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Claire wants to make 2 cakes for her mother. Two packages of flour are required for making a cake. If 1 package of flour is $3, how much does she pay for the flour that is enough to make 2 cakes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine how many packages of flour Claire needs to make 2 cakes. Since 2 packages of flour are required for making 1 cake, Claire needs 2 x 2 = 4 packages of flour to make 2 cakes. Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the flour. Since 1 package of flour costs $3, 4 packages of flour will cost 4 x $3 = $12. Therefore, Claire will pay $12 for the flour that is enough to make 2 cakes. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Samuel is going to the cinema with his brother, Kevin. They both have a total budget of $20 for their outing. Samuel buys his $14 ticket, then spends $6 on drinks and food. Kevin buys his ticket, then spends $2 on drinks. They have both used their entire budget. How much did Kevin spend on food?\nA: Let's think step by step. Samuel spent $14 on his ticket and $6 on food and drinks, which means he spent a total of $20. This means that Kevin must have spent $0 on food and drinks, since they both used their entire budget of $20. Therefore, Kevin spent $6 on his ticket and $2 on drinks, which means he spent a total of $8. Since he didn't spend any money on food, the answer is $0. The answer is 0.\n\n\nQ: Francis and Kiera had breakfast at a cafe. Muffins cost $2 each, and fruit cups cost $3 each. Francis had 2 muffins and 2 fruit cups. Kiera had 2 muffins and 1 fruit cup. How much did their breakfast cost?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the cost of Francis's breakfast. 2 muffins cost 2 x $2 = $4 2 fruit cups cost 2 x $3 = $6 So Francis's breakfast cost $4 + $6 = $10 Now let's calculate the cost of Kiera's breakfast. 2 muffins cost 2 x $2 = $4 1 fruit cup costs $3 So Kiera's breakfast cost $4 + $3 = $7 Finally, let's add the cost of Francis's and Kiera's breakfast to find the total cost. $10 + $7 = $17 Therefore, their breakfast cost $17 in total. The answer is 17.\n\n\n"
