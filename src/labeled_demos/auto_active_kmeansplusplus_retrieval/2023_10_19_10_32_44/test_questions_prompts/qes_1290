  "test_question": "Q: Ava and Emma want to know who is better at the new video game Ava got for her birthday. They are each going to play one level and whoever has the highest score wins. They receive 10 points for every enemy they jump on, 5 points for each berry they collect, and 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level. If Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries, but finishes the level 4 seconds slower, what is the difference between their two scores?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Ryan started with 36 tokens at the arcade. Ryan wasted a third of his tokens on Pac-Man, a fourth of his tokens on Candy Crush, and 7 on Ski-ball. Then, his parents bought him seven times as many tokens as he spent on Ski-ball. How many tokens did Ryan end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many tokens Ryan spent on Pac-Man and Candy Crush combined. Ryan spent 1/3 of his tokens on Pac-Man, which is (1/3) x 36 = 12 tokens. Ryan also spent 1/4 of his tokens on Candy Crush, which is (1/4) x 36 = 9 tokens. So, Ryan spent a total of 12 + 9 = 21 tokens on Pac-Man and Candy Crush. Next, we need to subtract the 7 tokens Ryan spent on Ski-ball from the total tokens he started with: 36 - 7 = 29 tokens Now, we know that Ryan's parents bought him seven times as many tokens as he spent on Ski-ball, which is 7 x 7 = 49 tokens. Finally, we can add up all the tokens Ryan has left: 29 - 21 + 49 = 57 tokens Therefore, Ryan ended up with 57 tokens. The answer is 57.\n\n\nQ: Tatuya, Ivanna, and Dorothy took a quiz together. Tatuya scored twice as much as Ivanna, and Ivanna scored 3/5 times as many marks as Dorothy. If Dorothy scored 90 marks, calculate the average marks scored by the three.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many marks Ivanna scored. We know that Ivanna scored 3/5 times as many marks as Dorothy, who scored 90 marks. So Ivanna scored: 3/5 * 90 = 54 marks Next, we need to find out how many marks Tatuya scored. We know that Tatuya scored twice as much as Ivanna, who scored 54 marks. So Tatuya scored: 2 * 54 = 108 marks Now we can find the total marks scored by the three of them: 90 + 54 + 108 = 252 marks Finally, we can calculate the average marks scored by the three: 252 / 3 = 84 marks Therefore, the average marks scored by Tatuya, Ivanna, and Dorothy is 84 marks. The answer is 84.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Last night Kannon had 3 apples, a banana, and 4 oranges for dinner. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, and twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today. How many fruits would she have eaten so far in the two meals?\nA: Let's think step by step. Last night Kannon had 3 apples, 1 banana, and 4 oranges, so she had a total of 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 fruits. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, which means she will have 3 + 4 = 7 apples today. She is also planning to have 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, which means she will have 1 x 10 = 10 bananas today. Finally, she is planning to have twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today, which means she will have 7 x 2 = 14 oranges today. Therefore, in total, Kannon will have eaten 7 + 10 + 14 = 31 fruits in the two meals. The answer is 31.\n\n\nQ: Oliver has 4 friends that he is inviting to a party at the arcade. Game tokens cost 30 for $1. Each game costs 2 tokens. If he wants all his friends to get to play 60 games each, how much will it cost?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how many games in total Oliver's friends will play. Since each friend will play 60 games, and Oliver has 4 friends, the total number of games played will be: 60 games/friend * 4 friends = 240 games Next, we need to calculate how many tokens are needed for 240 games. Since each game costs 2 tokens, the total number of tokens needed will be: 240 games * 2 tokens/game = 480 tokens Finally, we need to calculate how much it will cost to buy 480 tokens. Since 30 tokens cost $1, we can calculate the cost of 480 tokens as follows: 480 tokens / 30 tokens/$1 = $16 Therefore, it will cost $16 to buy enough tokens for Oliver and his friends to play 60 games each at the arcade. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Jan enters a double dutch competition.  After training she doubles her speed which used to be 70 skips per minute.  How many skips does she do in 5 minutes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out Jan's new speed after doubling it. 70 skips per minute x 2 = 140 skips per minute Now that we know Jan's new speed, we can find out how many skips she does in 5 minutes. 140 skips per minute x 5 minutes = 700 skips Therefore, Jan does 700 skips in 5 minutes after doubling her speed. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Mona plays a multiplayer video game on the weekends. She joins groups with four other players to complete objectives in the game. The past weekend, she joined 9 groups. One of the groups included two players she had grouped with before that weekend, and another group included one person she had grouped with before. How many unique players did Mona group with on the video game that weekend?\nA: Let's think step by step. Mona joined 9 groups in total. Out of these 9 groups, one group included two players she had grouped with before. So, we can count these two players only once. Similarly, another group included one person she had grouped with before. So, we can count this person only once as well. Therefore, the number of unique players Mona grouped with on the video game that weekend would be: 9 groups - 1 group with 2 repeat players - 1 group with 1 repeat player = 7 unique players. So, Mona grouped with 7 unique players on the video game that weekend. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Kwame studied for the history test for 2.5 hours. Connor studied for 1.5 hours and Lexia studied for 97 minutes. How many minutes more did Kwame and Connor study than Lexia?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert Kwame's study time from hours to minutes. We know that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, so: Kwame = 2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes Next, we need to convert Connor's study time from hours to minutes as well: Connor = 1.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 90 minutes Finally, we can add Kwame and Connor's study times together and subtract Lexia's study time to find the difference: Total study time = Kwame + Connor = 150 minutes + 90 minutes = 240 minutes Difference = Total study time - Lexia's study time = 240 minutes - 97 minutes = 143 minutes Therefore, Kwame and Connor studied 143 minutes more than Lexia. The answer is 143.\n\n\n"
