  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour. Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour.  Oliver can read 40 pages.  How many pages can Carter read in 1 hour?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Oliver can read 40 pages in 1 hour. Next, we know that Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour, so Lucy can read 40 + 20 = 60 pages in 1 hour. Finally, we know that Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour, so Carter can read 60 / 2 = 30 pages in 1 hour. Therefore, Carter can read 30 pages in 1 hour. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: A book has 8 chapters. Beth has read 2 chapters in 3 hours. If she continues reading at that rate, in how many hours will she be able to finish reading the remaining chapters?\nA: Let's think step by step. Beth has already read 2 chapters, so she needs to read the remaining 8 - 2 = 6 chapters. She can read 2 chapters in 3 hours, so she can read 1 chapter in 3/2 = 1.5 hours. Therefore, she will be able to finish reading the remaining 6 chapters in 6 x 1.5 = 9 hours. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Peter and Kristin are to read 20 fantasy novels each in a week. Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin. If Peter reads one book in 18 hours, how long will Kristin read half of her books?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Peter to read one book. We know that he can read one book in 18 hours, so we can write: Peter's reading speed = 1 book / 18 hours Next, we need to find out how long it takes Kristin to read one book. We know that Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin, so we can write: Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * Peter's reading speed Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * (1 book / 18 hours) Kristin's reading speed = 1 book / 54 hours Now we can use Kristin's reading speed to find out how long it takes her to read half of her books. We know that she needs to read 20 books in a week, so she needs to read 10 books in half a week (3.5 days). We can write: Time to read 10 books = 10 books * (1 book / 54 hours) * (24 hours / 1 day) * (3.5 days) Time to read 10 books = 14 hours and 27 minutes Therefore, it will take Kristin 14 hours and 27 minutes to read half of her books. The answer is 27.\n\n\nQ: Billy has 8 hours of free time on each day of the weekend. He wants to spend 75% of his time playing video games and the rest of his time reading. He can read 60 pages an hour and his books all contain 80 pages. How many books does he read?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts. First, we need to find out how much time Billy spends playing video games and how much time he spends reading. He has 8 hours of free time on each day of the weekend, so that's a total of 16 hours for the entire weekend. If he wants to spend 75% of his time playing video games, that means he will spend 0.75 x 16 = 12 hours playing video games. The rest of his time will be spent reading, which is 16 - 12 = 4 hours. Next, we need to find out how many pages he can read in 1 hour. We know that he can read 60 pages an hour, so that's 60 pages/hour. Finally, we need to find out how many books he can read in 4 hours. Each book contains 80 pages, so he can read 60/80 = 0.75 of a book in 1 hour. In 4 hours, he can read 4 x 0.75 = 3 books. Therefore, Billy can read 3 books during his free time on the weekend. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Jenny wants to read 3 books in the next 10 days. She can read 100 words per hour. If the first book has 200 words, the second book has 400 words, and the third book has 300 words, how many minutes per day, on average, should she spend reading?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find the total number of words in all three books: 200 + 400 + 300 = 900 words Next, let's find the total number of hours it will take Jenny to read all three books: 900 words \u00f7 100 words per hour = 9 hours Now, let's find the average number of minutes per day that Jenny should spend reading: 9 hours \u00f7 10 days = 0.9 hours per day 0.9 hours per day x 60 minutes per hour = 54 minutes per day Therefore, Jenny should spend an average of 54 minutes per day reading to finish all three books in 10 days. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many students are in Alice's class. We know that there are 40 students and 10 instructors, so the total number of people in the class is 40 + 10 = 50. Next, we need to figure out how many students are bringing their own life vests. We know that 20% of the students are bringing life vests, so we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of students by 0.2: 40 x 0.2 = 8. So 8 students are bringing their own life vests. Now we need to figure out how many life vests we still need. We have 20 life vests on hand, and we need one for each of the 50 people in the class. So we need 50 - 20 = 30 more life vests. However, we already know that 8 students are bringing their own life vests, so we can subtract those from the total number we need: 30 - 8 = 22. Therefore, Alice needs to get 22 more life vests so that the entire class has one. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Ron is part of a book club that allows each member to take a turn picking a new book every week. The club is made up of three couples and five single people along with Ron and his wife. How many times a year does Ron get to pick a new book?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of people in the book club. There are three couples, which means six people. There are also five single people. Adding Ron and his wife, we get: 6 (couples) + 5 (singles) + 2 (Ron and his wife) = 13 people in the book club Since each member gets to pick a new book every week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, we can calculate the number of times Ron gets to pick a new book: Ron gets to pick a new book once every 13 weeks (since there are 13 people in the club) 52 weeks in a year \u00f7 13 weeks per pick = 4 times a year Therefore, Ron gets to pick a new book 4 times a year. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Kwame studied for the history test for 2.5 hours. Connor studied for 1.5 hours and Lexia studied for 97 minutes. How many minutes more did Kwame and Connor study than Lexia?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert Kwame's study time from hours to minutes. We know that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, so: Kwame = 2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes Next, we need to convert Connor's study time from hours to minutes as well: Connor = 1.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 90 minutes Finally, we can add Kwame and Connor's study times together and subtract Lexia's study time to find the difference: Total study time = Kwame + Connor = 150 minutes + 90 minutes = 240 minutes Difference = Total study time - Lexia's study time = 240 minutes - 97 minutes = 143 minutes Therefore, Kwame and Connor studied 143 minutes more than Lexia. The answer is 143.\n\n\n"
