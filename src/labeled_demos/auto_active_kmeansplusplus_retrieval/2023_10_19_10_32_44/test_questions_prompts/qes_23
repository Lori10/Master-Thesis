  "formatted_prompt": "Q: John is working as an IT specialist. He repairs broken computers. One day he had to fix 20 computers. 20% of them were unfixable, and 40% of them needed to wait a few days for spare parts to come. The rest John was able to fix right away. How many computers John was able to fix right away?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many computers were unfixable. We know that 20% of 20 computers were unfixable, so we can calculate: 20% of 20 = 0.2 x 20 = 4 So, John couldn't fix 4 computers. Next, we need to find out how many computers needed to wait for spare parts. We know that 40% of 20 computers needed to wait, so we can calculate: 40% of 20 = 0.4 x 20 = 8 So, 8 computers needed to wait for spare parts. Now, we can subtract the unfixable and waiting computers from the total to find out how many John was able to fix right away: 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 Therefore, John was able to fix 8 computers right away. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Six more than twice as many ducks go to North Pond as go to Lake Michigan. If Lake Michigan has 100 ducks, how many ducks can you safely estimate there will be at North Pond?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many ducks go to North Pond. We know that \"Six more than twice as many ducks go to North Pond as go to Lake Michigan.\" So, we can start by finding twice as many ducks as Lake Michigan: 2 x 100 = 200 Now, we add six to that: 200 + 6 = 206 Therefore, we can safely estimate that there will be 206 ducks at North Pond. The answer is 206.\n\n\nQ: Luke started working on a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle. The first day he worked on it, he put together 10% of the pieces. On the second day, he put together another 20% of the remaining pieces from the first day. On the third day, he put together 30% of the remaining pieces from the previous day. How many pieces does he have left to complete after the third day?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Luke put together 10% of the 1000 pieces, which is 100 pieces. So he has 900 pieces left. On the second day, he put together 20% of the remaining 900 pieces, which is 180 pieces. So he has 720 pieces left. On the third day, he put together 30% of the remaining 720 pieces, which is 216 pieces. So he has 504 pieces left. Therefore, after the third day, Luke has 504 pieces left to complete the puzzle. The answer is 504.\n\n\nQ: A library has a number of books. 35% of them are intended for children and 104 of them are for adults. How many books are in the library?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 35% of the books are intended for children. This means that 65% of the books are intended for adults. We also know that there are 104 books intended for adults. To find the total number of books in the library, we can set up a proportion: 65/100 = 104/x We can cross-multiply to solve for x: 65x = 10400 x = 160 Therefore, there are 160 books in the library. The answer is 160.\n\n\nQ: A group of 30 tourists sets out on a walking tour of the rainforest. Two tourists are eaten by anacondas, then half the remaining tourists try to pet poisonous dart frogs and get poisoned. If only 1/7 of the poisoned tourists recovered, how many tourists are left at the end of the tour?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Start with 30 tourists. Step 2: Two tourists are eaten by anacondas, so we subtract 2 from 30 to get 28 tourists remaining. Step 3: Half of the remaining tourists try to pet poisonous dart frogs and get poisoned. Half of 28 is 14, so we subtract 14 from 28 to get 14 tourists remaining. Step 4: Only 1/7 of the poisoned tourists recovered. 1/7 of 14 is 2, so we add 2 to the 14 tourists remaining to get 16 tourists at the end of the tour. Therefore, there are 16 tourists left at the end of the tour. The answer is 16.\n\n\nQ: Mr. Maximilian is a dairy animal farmer and has 140 cows on his farm. Forty percent of the cows on his farm have a red spot, 25 percent of the cows without a red spot have a blue spot and the remaining cows do not have any spot. How many cows on the farm have no spot?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cows have a red spot. We can do this by multiplying the total number of cows (140) by the percentage that have a red spot (40% or 0.4): 140 x 0.4 = 56 cows with a red spot Next, we need to find out how many cows without a red spot have a blue spot. We can do this by subtracting the number of cows with a red spot from the total number of cows and then multiplying that by the percentage that have a blue spot (25% or 0.25): (140 - 56) x 0.25 = 21 cows without a red spot but with a blue spot Now we can find out how many cows have no spot by subtracting the number of cows with a red spot and the number of cows without a red spot but with a blue spot from the total number of cows: 140 - 56 - 21 = 63 cows with no spot Therefore, there are 63 cows on the farm with no spot. The answer is 63.\n\n\nQ: A performing magician has a disappearing act where he makes a random member of his audience disappear and reappear. Unfortunately, one-tenth of the time, the audience member never reappears. However, one-fifth of the time, two people reappear instead of only one. If the magician has put on 100 performances of the act this year, how many people have reappeared?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people disappear in total. Since the magician chooses a random member of the audience each time, we can assume that one person disappears per performance. Therefore, 100 people have disappeared in total. Next, we need to find out how many times one person reappears. We know that one-tenth of the time, the person never reappears, so that means nine-tenths of the time, they do reappear. Therefore, 90 people have reappeared once. Finally, we need to find out how many times two people reappear. We know that one-fifth of the time, this happens. Since there were 100 performances in total, this means that 20 times, two people reappeared. Therefore, 40 people have reappeared twice. To find the total number of people who have reappeared, we add the number of people who have reappeared once to the number of people who have reappeared twice: 90 + 40 = 130 Therefore, 130 people have reappeared in total. The answer is 130.\n\n\nQ: Forty percent of the students have elected to learn from home during the pandemic. The remaining students are divided into two equal groups, only one of which is physically in school on any day. What percent of students are present in school?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Let's assume that there are 100 students in total. Step 2: 40% of the students have elected to learn from home during the pandemic. So, the number of students learning from home is 40% of 100, which is 40. Step 3: The remaining students are 60 (100 - 40). Step 4: The remaining students are divided into two equal groups, so each group has 30 students. Step 5: Only one of the two groups is physically in school on any day. So, the number of students present in school is 30. Step 6: To find the percentage of students present in school, we need to divide the number of students present in school by the total number of students and multiply by 100. 30/100 x 100 = 30% Therefore, 30% of students are present in school. The answer is 30.\n\n\n"
