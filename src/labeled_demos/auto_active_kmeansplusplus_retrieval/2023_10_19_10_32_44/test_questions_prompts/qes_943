  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Merry had 50 boxes of apples on Saturday and 25 boxes on Sunday. There were 10 apples in each box. If she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, how many boxes of apples are left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many apples Merry had in total. On Saturday, she had 50 boxes of apples, and each box had 10 apples, so she had 50 x 10 = 500 apples on Saturday. On Sunday, she had 25 boxes of apples, and each box had 10 apples, so she had 25 x 10 = 250 apples on Sunday. In total, she had 500 + 250 = 750 apples. Next, we need to find out how many apples she sold. We know that she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, so she must have had 750 - 720 = 30 apples left. Finally, we need to find out how many boxes of apples she has left. We know that there are 10 apples in each box, so she must have 30 / 10 = 3 boxes of apples left. Therefore, Merry has 3 boxes of apples left. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Every Monday to Friday morning, Alice walks 10 miles through a large grass field to get to school. To avoid the hot afternoon sun on her way home, she walks 12 miles through a forest. When she gets home on Friday, how many miles will she have walked that week?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. Alice walks 10 miles every morning from Monday to Friday. So, in total, she walks 10 x 5 = 50 miles during the weekdays. On her way back home, she walks 12 miles every afternoon from Monday to Friday. So, in total, she walks 12 x 5 = 60 miles during the weekdays. Therefore, the total distance Alice walks during the weekdays is 50 + 60 = 110 miles. Since the problem asks for the total distance Alice walks in a week, we need to add the distance she walks on Saturday and Sunday as well. Let's assume Alice doesn't walk to school on weekends. So, the total distance she walks on weekends is 0. Therefore, the total distance Alice walks in a week is 110 + 0 + 0 = 110 miles. The answer is 110.\n\n\nQ: Monica way studying for an exam. She studied for 2 hours on Wednesday and three times as long on Thursday. On Friday Monica studied half of the time she studied on Thursday. During the weekend (two days) Monica studied as much again as Wednesday, Thursday and Friday combined. How much time did she spend studying in total during the five days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On Wednesday, Monica studied for 2 hours. On Thursday, she studied three times as long as Wednesday, which means she studied for 2 x 3 = 6 hours. On Friday, she studied half of the time she studied on Thursday, which means she studied for 6 / 2 = 3 hours. The total time Monica studied from Wednesday to Friday is 2 + 6 + 3 = 11 hours. During the weekend, Monica studied as much again as Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday combined, which means she studied for 11 x 2 = 22 hours. Therefore, Monica spent a total of 11 + 22 = 33 hours studying during the five days. The answer is 33.\n\n\nQ: On Friday, Hank opened his used-bicycle store with a stock of bicycles, all fixed-up and ready to ride. Over the course of the day, he sold 10 bicycles and bought an additional 15 to fix up. On Saturday, he sold 12 bicycles and bought 8 more. And on Sunday, he sold 9 bicycles and bought 11 more. What was the net increase in the number of bicycles in stock in Hank's store over the three days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On Friday, Hank sold 10 bicycles and bought 15 more, so the net increase in the number of bicycles in stock was 15 - 10 = 5. On Saturday, he sold 12 bicycles and bought 8 more, so the net decrease in the number of bicycles in stock was 12 - 8 = 4. On Sunday, he sold 9 bicycles and bought 11 more, so the net increase in the number of bicycles in stock was 11 - 9 = 2. To find the overall net increase in the number of bicycles in stock over the three days, we need to add up the net increases and net decreases: Net increase on Friday = 5 Net decrease on Saturday = -4 Net increase on Sunday = 2 Overall net increase = 5 - 4 + 2 = 3 Therefore, the net increase in the number of bicycles in stock in Hank's store over the three days was 3. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: A bicycle shop owner adds 3 bikes to her stock every week. After 1 month, she had sold 18 bikes but still had 45 bikes in stock. How many bikes did she have originally?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's figure out how many weeks are in a month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of bikes added each week (3) by the number of weeks in a month (4) to find out how many bikes were added in total: 3 bikes/week x 4 weeks/month = 12 bikes/month Next, we can subtract the number of bikes sold (18) from the number of bikes in stock after 1 month (45) to find out how many bikes were in stock before any were sold: 45 bikes - 18 bikes = 27 bikes Finally, we can add the number of bikes added in total (12) to the number of bikes in stock before any were sold (27) to find out how many bikes the shop owner originally had: 27 bikes + 12 bikes = 39 bikes Therefore, the shop owner originally had 39 bikes in stock. The answer is 39.\n\n\nQ: John takes a pill every 6 hours.  How many pills does he take a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 24 hours in a day, so John takes 24/6 = 4 pills per day. In a week, there are 7 days, so John takes 4 x 7 = 28 pills per week. The answer is 28.\n\n\nQ: Tracy has been collecting novels from her friends to donate to the Children For The Future charity organization. In the first week she collects a certain number of books. In the next five weeks, she collects ten times as many books as she did in the first week. How many books did she collect in the first week if she has 99 books now?\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that Tracy collected x number of books in the first week. According to the problem, in the next five weeks, she collected ten times as many books as she did in the first week. So, in the next five weeks, she collected 10x books. Therefore, the total number of books she collected is x + 10x = 11x. We also know that she has 99 books now. So, we can set up an equation: 11x = 99 To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 11: x = 9 Therefore, Tracy collected 9 books in the first week. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Jill spends time every day talking to her boyfriend on the phone.  The first day of the week she spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend.  Each of the following days she spends twice as much time talking on the phone as the day before. After the 5th day her parents take the phone away from her because she was on it too long.  How much time did Jill spend talking to her boyfriend that week?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Jill spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend. On the second day, she spends twice as much time as the first day, which is 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 minutes. On the third day, she spends twice as much time as the second day, which is 2*10=<<2*10=20>>20 minutes. On the fourth day, she spends twice as much time as the third day, which is 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 minutes. On the fifth day, she spends twice as much time as the fourth day, which is 2*40=<<2*40=80>>80 minutes. Therefore, Jill spends a total of 5+10+20+40+80=<<5+10+20+40+80=155>>155 minutes talking to her boyfriend that week. The answer is 155.\n\n\n"
