  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Ann can skate 6 miles an hour. Her friend Glenda can skate 8 miles an hour. If they start in the same place and skate in straight lines in opposite directions for 3 hours, how many miles apart do they end up?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how far Ann and Glenda each skate in 3 hours. Ann: 6 miles/hour x 3 hours = 18 miles Glenda: 8 miles/hour x 3 hours = 24 miles Step 2: Add the distances they each skated to find the total distance between them. 18 miles + 24 miles = 42 miles Therefore, Ann and Glenda end up 42 miles apart after skating in opposite directions for 3 hours. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Richard starts walking from Cincinnati to New York City, which is 70 miles. Richards walks 20 miles the first day. The next day he walks 6 miles less than half as much as he walked the first day. He walks 10 miles the third day. How many miles further does Richard have to walk to be in New York City?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Richard walks 20 miles. On the second day, he walks 6 miles less than half as much as he walked the first day. Half of what he walked on the first day is 20/2 = 10 miles. So, he walks 10 - 6 = 4 miles on the second day. On the third day, he walks 10 miles. Therefore, the total distance Richard has walked so far is 20 + 4 + 10 = 34 miles. To reach New York City, which is 70 miles away, Richard still has to walk 70 - 34 = 36 miles further. The answer is 36.\n\n\nQ: A car driving cross-country traveled 180 miles in 4 hours. At this rate of speed, how many miles further will the car travel in the next 3 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the car's speed in miles per hour (mph). To do this, we divide the distance traveled by the time taken: Speed = Distance \u00f7 Time Speed = 180 miles \u00f7 4 hours Speed = 45 mph Now that we know the car's speed, we can use it to calculate how far it will travel in the next 3 hours: Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time Distance = 45 mph \u00d7 3 hours Distance = 135 miles Therefore, the car will travel 135 miles further in the next 3 hours. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Mr. Maxwell takes 1 hr to drive to work in the morning but 1 and half hours to drive back home in the evening. If the morning and evening traffic is similar and he drives at an average speed of 30mph in the morning, what is the average speed of his return journey?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time Since Mr. Maxwell drives at an average speed of 30mph in the morning and takes 1 hour to drive to work, we can calculate the distance he travels in the morning as: distance = 30 x 1 = 30 miles Now, we know that the distance he travels in the evening is the same as the distance he travels in the morning (assuming he takes the same route). So, we can use the formula again to find his average speed in the evening: speed = distance / time We know the distance is 30 miles, but we need to find the time it takes him to drive back home. We're told that it takes him 1 and a half hours, which we can also write as 1.5 hours. Therefore, his average speed in the evening is: speed = 30 / 1.5 = 20 mph So, the average speed of his return journey is 20 mph. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Colin ran his first mile in 6 minutes.  He ran his next two miles in 5 minutes each and finished his 4th mile in 4 minutes.  What was the average time it took him to run a mile?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total time it took Colin to run all four miles. - Colin's first mile took 6 minutes. - His next two miles took 5 minutes each, so that's a total of 10 minutes. - His fourth mile took 4 minutes. To find the total time, we add these up: 6 + 10 + 4 = 20 So Colin ran four miles in a total of 20 minutes. To find the average time it took him to run a mile, we divide the total time by the number of miles: 20 / 4 = 5 So Colin's average time to run a mile was 5 minutes. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Yvonne swims 10 laps in 5 minutes.  Her younger sister can swim half as many laps as Yvonne in the same time frame.  Their brother Joel can swim three times the number of laps as the youngest sister.  How many laps can Joel swim?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many laps Yvonne's younger sister can swim in 5 minutes. Since she can swim half as many laps as Yvonne, we can divide Yvonne's number of laps by 2: Yvonne's sister = 10 laps / 2 = 5 laps Next, we need to figure out how many laps Joel can swim. We know that he can swim three times the number of laps as the youngest sister, so we can multiply her number of laps by 3: Joel = 5 laps * 3 = 15 laps Therefore, Joel can swim 15 laps in 5 minutes. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Charlie can make 5350 steps while running on a 3-kilometer running field. If he can run around the field 2 1/2 times during a running session, how many steps was he able to make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many steps Charlie takes per kilometer. To do this, we can divide the total number of steps (5350) by the distance he runs (3 kilometers): 5350 steps \u00f7 3 kilometers = 1783.33 steps/kilometer Next, we need to find out how far Charlie runs during one lap around the field. We know that he runs around the field 2 1/2 times, which is the same as 2.5 laps. Since the field is 3 kilometers long, one lap around the field is: 3 kilometers/lap So, 2.5 laps around the field is: 2.5 laps x 3 kilometers/lap = 7.5 kilometers Finally, we can use the steps per kilometer ratio we found earlier to calculate how many steps Charlie takes during 7.5 kilometers: 1783.33 steps/kilometer x 7.5 kilometers = 13375 steps Therefore, Charlie was able to make 13375 steps during his running session. The answer is 13375.\n\n\nQ: In mid-May, the depth of a river in Moreland is measured. By mid-June, the river is 10 feet deeper than mid-May. By mid-July, the river is three times deeper than mid-June. If the river is 45 feet deep in mid-July, how many feet deep was the river in mid-May?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that in mid-June, the river is 10 feet deeper than mid-May. So, if we let x be the depth of the river in mid-May, then the depth of the river in mid-June is x + 10. Next, we know that in mid-July, the river is three times deeper than mid-June. So, if we let y be the depth of the river in mid-July, then we can write: y = 3(x + 10) We also know that the river is 45 feet deep in mid-July, so we can substitute that into the equation: 45 = 3(x + 10) Simplifying the equation, we get: 15 = x + 10 Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 5 = x Therefore, the river was 5 feet deep in mid-May. The answer is 5.\n\n\n"
