  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Sandra eats 3 beignets every morning.  How many beignets will she eat in 16 weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many beignets Sandra eats in one week. To do this, we can multiply the number of beignets she eats in one day (3) by the number of days in a week (7): 3 beignets/day x 7 days/week = 21 beignets/week So Sandra eats 21 beignets in one week. Next, we need to find out how many beignets she will eat in 16 weeks. To do this, we can multiply the number of beignets she eats in one week (21) by the number of weeks (16): 21 beignets/week x 16 weeks = 336 beignets Therefore, Sandra will eat 336 beignets in 16 weeks. The answer is 16.\n\n\nQ: Paul has five dogs. For every 10 pounds they weigh, they need 1 pound of dog food per day. One weighs 20 pounds. One weighs 40. Another weighs 10. One weighs 30 and the final one weighs 50 pounds. How much dog food does he need each day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total weight of all five dogs. Total weight = 20 + 40 + 10 + 30 + 50 = 150 pounds Next, we need to calculate how much dog food is needed per day for every 10 pounds of weight. 1 pound of dog food is needed for every 10 pounds of weight So, for 150 pounds of weight, we need: 150/10 = 15 pounds of dog food per day Therefore, Paul needs 15 pounds of dog food each day to feed his five dogs. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how much money Carl will earn in four weeks. If he earns $0.50 every time, and he buys a candy bar each time, that means he's spending $0.50 each week. But he's also earning $0.75 each week for taking out his neighbor's trash. So his net earnings each week are $0.75 - $0.50 = $0.25. Over four weeks, that's a total of $0.25 x 4 = $1. So Carl will have $1 to spend on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.50, he can buy 2 candy bars with his earnings. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: A cake of 400 grams is divided into eight equal parts. Nathalie eats one-eighth of the cake, and Pierre eats double what Nathalie ate. How much did Pierre eat, in grams?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much one-eighth of the cake weighs. We can do this by dividing the weight of the cake (400 grams) by 8: 400 \u00f7 8 = 50 So one-eighth of the cake weighs 50 grams. Next, we need to find out how much Pierre ate, which is double what Nathalie ate. We can do this by multiplying Nathalie's portion (50 grams) by 2: 50 \u00d7 2 = 100 Therefore, Pierre ate 100 grams of the cake. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: There are four members in one household. Each member consumes 3 slices of bread during breakfast and 2 slices of bread for snacks. A loaf of bread has 12 slices. How many days will five loaves of bread last in this family?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of bread each member consumes per day. For breakfast, each member consumes 3 slices of bread. For snacks, each member consumes 2 slices of bread. So, in total, each member consumes 3 + 2 = 5 slices of bread per day. Since there are four members in the household, the total number of slices of bread consumed per day is 4 x 5 = 20 slices. Now, we need to find out how many days five loaves of bread will last. One loaf of bread has 12 slices, so five loaves of bread have 5 x 12 = 60 slices. If the family consumes 20 slices of bread per day, then 60 slices will last for 60/20 = 3 days. Therefore, five loaves of bread will last for 3 days in this family. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Seth lost 17.5 pounds. Jerome lost three times that many pounds and Veronica lost 1.5 pounds more than Seth. How many pounds did the 3 people lose in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Seth lost 17.5 pounds. Next, we need to find out how much weight Jerome lost. We are told that Jerome lost three times as much weight as Seth, so we can multiply Seth's weight loss by 3: 17.5 x 3 = 52.5 So Jerome lost 52.5 pounds. Finally, we need to find out how much weight Veronica lost. We are told that she lost 1.5 pounds more than Seth, so we can add 1.5 to Seth's weight loss: 17.5 + 1.5 = 19 So Veronica lost 19 pounds. To find the total weight loss for all three people, we can add up their individual weight losses: 17.5 + 52.5 + 19 = 89 Therefore, the three people lost a total of 89 pounds. The answer is 89.\n\n\nQ: In preparation for the church fundraiser, Julia bakes one less than 5 cakes per day for 6 days.  Unfortunately, every other day, Julia's brother, Clifford, sneaks into Julia's house and eats one of Julia's cakes.  At the end of 6 days, how many cakes does Julia have remaining?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cakes Julia bakes per day. We know that she bakes one less than 5 cakes per day, so that means she bakes 4 cakes per day. Next, we need to figure out how many cakes Julia bakes in total over the 6 days. To do this, we can multiply the number of cakes she bakes per day (4) by the number of days she bakes (6): 4 cakes/day x 6 days = 24 cakes So Julia bakes a total of 24 cakes over the 6 days. Now we need to figure out how many cakes Clifford eats. We know that he eats one of Julia's cakes every other day, so that means he eats 3 cakes over the 6 days (since there are 3 pairs of days where he eats a cake). Finally, we can subtract the number of cakes Clifford eats from the total number of cakes Julia bakes to find out how many cakes she has remaining: 24 cakes - 3 cakes = 21 cakes So Julia has 21 cakes remaining at the end of the 6 days. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Last night Kannon had 3 apples, a banana, and 4 oranges for dinner. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, and twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today. How many fruits would she have eaten so far in the two meals?\nA: Let's think step by step. Last night Kannon had 3 apples, 1 banana, and 4 oranges, so she had a total of 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 fruits. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, which means she will have 3 + 4 = 7 apples today. She is also planning to have 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, which means she will have 1 x 10 = 10 bananas today. Finally, she is planning to have twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today, which means she will have 7 x 2 = 14 oranges today. Therefore, in total, Kannon will have eaten 7 + 10 + 14 = 31 fruits in the two meals. The answer is 31.\n\n\n"
