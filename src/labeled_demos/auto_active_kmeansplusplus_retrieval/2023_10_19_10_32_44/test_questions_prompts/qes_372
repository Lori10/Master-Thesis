  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A soccer team had 24 players prepared for a soccer game. The first half saw 11 players start the game with 2 substitutions made. In the second half, the team made twice as many substitutions as it made in the first half. How many players on the team did not play that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many players played in the first half. We know that 11 players started the game, and 2 substitutions were made, so a total of 13 players played in the first half. Next, we need to find out how many substitutions were made in the second half. We know that the team made twice as many substitutions as it made in the first half, so that means 2 x 2 = 4 substitutions were made in the second half. Now we can calculate how many players played in the second half. We know that there were 13 players who played in the first half, and 4 substitutions were made, so a total of 17 players played in the second half. Finally, we can calculate how many players did not play that day. We know that the team had 24 players prepared for the game, and 13 players played in the first half, and 17 players played in the second half. So, 24 - 13 - 17 = 4 players did not play that day. Therefore, there were 4 players on the team who did not play that day. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Mona plays a multiplayer video game on the weekends. She joins groups with four other players to complete objectives in the game. The past weekend, she joined 9 groups. One of the groups included two players she had grouped with before that weekend, and another group included one person she had grouped with before. How many unique players did Mona group with on the video game that weekend?\nA: Let's think step by step. Mona joined 9 groups in total. Out of these 9 groups, one group included two players she had grouped with before. So, we can count these two players only once. Similarly, another group included one person she had grouped with before. So, we can count this person only once as well. Therefore, the number of unique players Mona grouped with on the video game that weekend would be: 9 groups - 1 group with 2 repeat players - 1 group with 1 repeat player = 7 unique players. So, Mona grouped with 7 unique players on the video game that weekend. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Monica way studying for an exam. She studied for 2 hours on Wednesday and three times as long on Thursday. On Friday Monica studied half of the time she studied on Thursday. During the weekend (two days) Monica studied as much again as Wednesday, Thursday and Friday combined. How much time did she spend studying in total during the five days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On Wednesday, Monica studied for 2 hours. On Thursday, she studied three times as long as Wednesday, which means she studied for 2 x 3 = 6 hours. On Friday, she studied half of the time she studied on Thursday, which means she studied for 6 / 2 = 3 hours. The total time Monica studied from Wednesday to Friday is 2 + 6 + 3 = 11 hours. During the weekend, Monica studied as much again as Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday combined, which means she studied for 11 x 2 = 22 hours. Therefore, Monica spent a total of 11 + 22 = 33 hours studying during the five days. The answer is 33.\n\n\nQ: John takes a pill every 6 hours.  How many pills does he take a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 24 hours in a day, so John takes 24/6 = 4 pills per day. In a week, there are 7 days, so John takes 4 x 7 = 28 pills per week. The answer is 28.\n\n\nQ: John can play 200 beats per minute.  If he plays 2 hours a day for 3 days how many beats does he play?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many minutes John plays in total. Since he plays for 2 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, he plays for 2 x 60 = 120 minutes per day. Therefore, over 3 days, he plays for a total of 120 x 3 = 360 minutes. Now we need to find out how many beats he plays in total. If he plays 200 beats per minute, then in 360 minutes he plays 200 x 360 = 72,000 beats. So John plays 72,000 beats over the course of 3 days. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Every Monday to Friday morning, Alice walks 10 miles through a large grass field to get to school. To avoid the hot afternoon sun on her way home, she walks 12 miles through a forest. When she gets home on Friday, how many miles will she have walked that week?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. Alice walks 10 miles every morning from Monday to Friday. So, in total, she walks 10 x 5 = 50 miles during the weekdays. On her way back home, she walks 12 miles every afternoon from Monday to Friday. So, in total, she walks 12 x 5 = 60 miles during the weekdays. Therefore, the total distance Alice walks during the weekdays is 50 + 60 = 110 miles. Since the problem asks for the total distance Alice walks in a week, we need to add the distance she walks on Saturday and Sunday as well. Let's assume Alice doesn't walk to school on weekends. So, the total distance she walks on weekends is 0. Therefore, the total distance Alice walks in a week is 110 + 0 + 0 = 110 miles. The answer is 110.\n\n\nQ: Billy and Tiffany are having a contest to see how can run the most miles in a week. On Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, Billy runs 1 mile each day and Tiffany runs 2 miles each day. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, Billy runs 1 mile each day and Tiffany runs a 1/3 of a mile each day. On Saturday Tiffany assumes she's going to win and takes the day off. How many miles does Billy have to run on Saturday to tie Tiffany?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how many miles Billy and Tiffany run from Sunday to Friday: Billy: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 miles Tiffany: 2 + 2 + 2 + 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 6 2/3 miles So, by Friday, Tiffany is ahead by 2/3 of a mile. To tie Tiffany, Billy needs to run 2/3 of a mile on Saturday. Therefore, Billy needs to run 0.67 miles on Saturday to tie Tiffany. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Billy has 8 hours of free time on each day of the weekend. He wants to spend 75% of his time playing video games and the rest of his time reading. He can read 60 pages an hour and his books all contain 80 pages. How many books does he read?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts. First, we need to find out how much time Billy spends playing video games and how much time he spends reading. He has 8 hours of free time on each day of the weekend, so that's a total of 16 hours for the entire weekend. If he wants to spend 75% of his time playing video games, that means he will spend 0.75 x 16 = 12 hours playing video games. The rest of his time will be spent reading, which is 16 - 12 = 4 hours. Next, we need to find out how many pages he can read in 1 hour. We know that he can read 60 pages an hour, so that's 60 pages/hour. Finally, we need to find out how many books he can read in 4 hours. Each book contains 80 pages, so he can read 60/80 = 0.75 of a book in 1 hour. In 4 hours, he can read 4 x 0.75 = 3 books. Therefore, Billy can read 3 books during his free time on the weekend. The answer is 3.\n\n\n"
