  "test_question": "Q: Candy has a chair rental business. During the weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day; but during weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day. If this continues, how many chairs in total will Candy be able to rent out in two 4-week months?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how much money Carl will earn in four weeks. If he earns $0.50 every time, and he buys a candy bar each time, that means he's spending $0.50 each week. But he's also earning $0.75 each week for taking out his neighbor's trash. So his net earnings each week are $0.75 - $0.50 = $0.25. Over four weeks, that's a total of $0.25 x 4 = $1. So Carl will have $1 to spend on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.50, he can buy 2 candy bars with his earnings. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Gerald is a furniture maker. He has 672 pieces of wood and he wants to make some tables and chairs. It takes 12 pieces of wood to make a table and 8 pieces of wood to make a chair. How many chairs can he make if he makes 24 tables?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many pieces of wood Gerald will use to make 24 tables. To make one table, he needs 12 pieces of wood. So to make 24 tables, he will need: 12 x 24 = 288 pieces of wood Now, let's subtract the pieces of wood used for the tables from the total number of pieces of wood Gerald has: 672 - 288 = 384 pieces of wood left Finally, let's find out how many chairs Gerald can make with the remaining pieces of wood. To make one chair, he needs 8 pieces of wood. So the number of chairs he can make is: 384 \u00f7 8 = 48 chairs Therefore, Gerald can make 48 chairs if he makes 24 tables. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Carl has a goal of selling 96 cupcakes in 2 days. Carl needs to give 24 cupcakes to Bonnie as payment for using her storefront. How many cupcakes must Carl sell per day to reach his goal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to subtract the 24 cupcakes that Carl needs to give to Bonnie from his goal of selling 96 cupcakes. 96 - 24 = 72 So Carl needs to sell 72 cupcakes in 2 days. To find out how many cupcakes he needs to sell per day, we can divide 72 by 2: 72 \u00f7 2 = 36 Therefore, Carl needs to sell 36 cupcakes per day to reach his goal of selling 96 cupcakes in 2 days, after giving 24 cupcakes to Bonnie. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: A bicycle shop owner adds 3 bikes to her stock every week. After 1 month, she had sold 18 bikes but still had 45 bikes in stock. How many bikes did she have originally?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's figure out how many weeks are in a month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of bikes added each week (3) by the number of weeks in a month (4) to find out how many bikes were added in total: 3 bikes/week x 4 weeks/month = 12 bikes/month Next, we can subtract the number of bikes sold (18) from the number of bikes in stock after 1 month (45) to find out how many bikes were in stock before any were sold: 45 bikes - 18 bikes = 27 bikes Finally, we can add the number of bikes added in total (12) to the number of bikes in stock before any were sold (27) to find out how many bikes the shop owner originally had: 27 bikes + 12 bikes = 39 bikes Therefore, the shop owner originally had 39 bikes in stock. The answer is 39.\n\n\nQ: A big box store sees 175 people enter their store every hour.  This number doubles during the holiday season.  During the holiday season, how many customers will this big box store see in 8 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers the store sees in one hour during the holiday season. To do this, we can double the number of customers the store sees in a regular hour: 175 x 2 = 350 So during the holiday season, the store sees 350 customers per hour. Next, we need to find out how many customers the store will see in 8 hours during the holiday season. To do this, we can multiply the number of customers per hour by the number of hours: 350 x 8 = 2800 Therefore, during the holiday season, the big box store will see 2800 customers in 8 hours. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Merry had 50 boxes of apples on Saturday and 25 boxes on Sunday. There were 10 apples in each box. If she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, how many boxes of apples are left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many apples Merry had in total. On Saturday, she had 50 boxes of apples, and each box had 10 apples, so she had 50 x 10 = 500 apples on Saturday. On Sunday, she had 25 boxes of apples, and each box had 10 apples, so she had 25 x 10 = 250 apples on Sunday. In total, she had 500 + 250 = 750 apples. Next, we need to find out how many apples she sold. We know that she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, so she must have had 750 - 720 = 30 apples left. Finally, we need to find out how many boxes of apples she has left. We know that there are 10 apples in each box, so she must have 30 / 10 = 3 boxes of apples left. Therefore, Merry has 3 boxes of apples left. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Doris earns $20 per hour by babysitting. She needs to earn at least $1200 for her monthly expenses. She can babysit for 3 hours every weekday and 5 hours on a Saturday.  How many weeks does it take for Doris to earn enough to cover her monthly expenses?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much Doris earns per week by babysitting. She babysits for 3 hours every weekday, which is a total of 15 hours per week (3 hours x 5 days). She also babysits for 5 hours on a Saturday, which adds another 5 hours to her weekly total. So, in total, she babysits for 20 hours per week. If she earns $20 per hour, then she earns 20 x 20 = $400 per week. To cover her monthly expenses of $1200, she needs to earn 1200 / 400 = 3 weeks of babysitting. Therefore, it takes Doris 3 weeks to earn enough to cover her monthly expenses. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Mary wants 144 cupcakes for her party. Mary has already made 36 cherry cupcakes, and 48 berry cupcakes. Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes for the rest. How much of each should she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Mary has already made: 36 cherry + 48 berry = 84 cupcakes Next, we need to figure out how many more cupcakes Mary needs to make: 144 total cupcakes - 84 cupcakes already made = 60 cupcakes Since Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, we can divide the remaining 60 cupcakes by 2: 60 cupcakes \u00f7 2 = 30 cupcakes of each flavor Therefore, Mary should make 30 chocolate cupcakes and 30 vanilla cupcakes to have a total of 144 cupcakes for her party. The answer is 144.\n\n\n"
