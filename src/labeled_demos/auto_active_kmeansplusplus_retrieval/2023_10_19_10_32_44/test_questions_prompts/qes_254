  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Cody has an insurance plan that will give him a discount if he logs a total of 100,000 steps. For the first week, he logs 1,000 steps a day.  He increases his daily number of steps by 1,000 every week.  After 4 weeks how far away from his step goal will he be?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how many steps Cody logs in the first week: 1,000 steps/day x 7 days = 7,000 steps Next, let's calculate how many steps Cody logs in the second week: 2,000 steps/day x 7 days = 14,000 steps We can continue this pattern for the third and fourth weeks: 3,000 steps/day x 7 days = 21,000 steps 4,000 steps/day x 7 days = 28,000 steps Now, let's add up all the steps Cody has logged in the four weeks: 7,000 + 14,000 + 21,000 + 28,000 = 70,000 steps Cody is 30,000 steps away from his step goal of 100,000. The answer is 100000.\n\n\nQ: Paul has five dogs. For every 10 pounds they weigh, they need 1 pound of dog food per day. One weighs 20 pounds. One weighs 40. Another weighs 10. One weighs 30 and the final one weighs 50 pounds. How much dog food does he need each day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total weight of all five dogs. Total weight = 20 + 40 + 10 + 30 + 50 = 150 pounds Next, we need to calculate how much dog food is needed per day for every 10 pounds of weight. 1 pound of dog food is needed for every 10 pounds of weight So, for 150 pounds of weight, we need: 150/10 = 15 pounds of dog food per day Therefore, Paul needs 15 pounds of dog food each day to feed his five dogs. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Brandon can catch 6 squirrels or two rabbits in 1 hour. Each squirrel has 300 calories and each rabbit has 800 calories. How many more calories will he get per hour if he catches squirrels instead of rabbits?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many calories Brandon can get from catching squirrels in one hour. We know that each squirrel has 300 calories, and he can catch 6 squirrels in one hour. So, the total number of calories he can get from catching squirrels in one hour is: 300 calories/squirrel x 6 squirrels = 1800 calories Next, we need to find out how many calories Brandon can get from catching rabbits in one hour. We know that each rabbit has 800 calories, and he can catch 2 rabbits in one hour. So, the total number of calories he can get from catching rabbits in one hour is: 800 calories/rabbit x 2 rabbits = 1600 calories Finally, we need to find out how many more calories Brandon will get per hour if he catches squirrels instead of rabbits. We can do this by subtracting the number of calories he can get from catching rabbits from the number of calories he can get from catching squirrels: 1800 calories - 1600 calories = 200 calories Therefore, Brandon will get 200 more calories per hour if he catches squirrels instead of rabbits. The answer is 200.\n\n\nQ: Logan makes $65,000 a year. He spends $20,000 on rent every year, $5000 on groceries every year, and $8000 on gas every year. If he wants to have at least $42000 left, how much more money must he make each year?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how much Logan spends in total each year: $20,000 (rent) + $5,000 (groceries) + $8,000 (gas) = $33,000 Next, we need to subtract that amount from his annual income: $65,000 (income) - $33,000 (expenses) = $32,000 So Logan currently has $32,000 left after paying his expenses. However, he wants to have at least $42,000 left. Therefore, we need to calculate how much more money he needs to make each year: $42,000 (desired savings) - $32,000 (current savings) = $10,000 Therefore, Logan needs to make at least $10,000 more each year to reach his desired savings goal. The answer is 10000.\n\n\nQ: Seth lost 17.5 pounds. Jerome lost three times that many pounds and Veronica lost 1.5 pounds more than Seth. How many pounds did the 3 people lose in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Seth lost 17.5 pounds. Next, we need to find out how much weight Jerome lost. We are told that Jerome lost three times as much weight as Seth, so we can multiply Seth's weight loss by 3: 17.5 x 3 = 52.5 So Jerome lost 52.5 pounds. Finally, we need to find out how much weight Veronica lost. We are told that she lost 1.5 pounds more than Seth, so we can add 1.5 to Seth's weight loss: 17.5 + 1.5 = 19 So Veronica lost 19 pounds. To find the total weight loss for all three people, we can add up their individual weight losses: 17.5 + 52.5 + 19 = 89 Therefore, the three people lost a total of 89 pounds. The answer is 89.\n\n\nQ: James takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces.  He splits the pieces between 4 people.  If an orange has 80 calories how many calories does each person get?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pieces James has in total. He takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces, so he has 5 x 8 = 40 pieces in total. Next, we need to divide the pieces between 4 people. To do this, we can divide the total number of pieces by 4: 40 \u00f7 4 = 10 pieces per person. Finally, we need to find out how many calories each person gets. We know that one orange has 80 calories, so each piece has 80 \u00f7 8 = 10 calories. Therefore, each person gets 10 x 10 = 100 calories. So each person gets 100 calories. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Richard starts walking from Cincinnati to New York City, which is 70 miles. Richards walks 20 miles the first day. The next day he walks 6 miles less than half as much as he walked the first day. He walks 10 miles the third day. How many miles further does Richard have to walk to be in New York City?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Richard walks 20 miles. On the second day, he walks 6 miles less than half as much as he walked the first day. Half of what he walked on the first day is 20/2 = 10 miles. So, he walks 10 - 6 = 4 miles on the second day. On the third day, he walks 10 miles. Therefore, the total distance Richard has walked so far is 20 + 4 + 10 = 34 miles. To reach New York City, which is 70 miles away, Richard still has to walk 70 - 34 = 36 miles further. The answer is 36.\n\n\nQ: Herman likes to feed the birds in December, January and February.  He feeds them 1/2 cup in the morning and 1/2 cup in the afternoon.  How many cups of food will he need for all three months?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days there are in December, January, and February. December has 31 days, January has 31 days, and February has 28 days (or 29 in a leap year). Next, we need to find out how many times Herman feeds the birds in a day. He feeds them 1/2 cup in the morning and 1/2 cup in the afternoon, so he feeds them a total of 1 cup per day. Now we can calculate how much food he needs for all three months. In one month, he feeds the birds for 31 days, so he needs 31 cups of food (1 cup per day). For all three months, he needs 31 cups x 3 months = 93 cups of food. The answer is 93.\n\n\n"
