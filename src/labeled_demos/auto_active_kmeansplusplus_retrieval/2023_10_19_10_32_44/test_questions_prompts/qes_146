  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Kendra made 4 more than five times as many decorated buttons as Mari. Sue made half as many as Kendra. Mari made 8 buttons. How many did Sue make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many buttons Kendra made. We know that Kendra made 4 more than five times as many decorated buttons as Mari, and Mari made 8 buttons. So, we can write an equation: Kendra's buttons = 4 + 5 x Mari's buttons Kendra's buttons = 4 + 5 x 8 Kendra's buttons = 44 Therefore, Kendra made 44 buttons. Next, we need to find out how many buttons Sue made. We know that Sue made half as many as Kendra, so we can write another equation: Sue's buttons = 1/2 x Kendra's buttons Sue's buttons = 1/2 x 44 Sue's buttons = 22 Therefore, Sue made 22 buttons. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Dani brings two and half dozen cupcakes for her 2nd-grade class.  There are 27 students (including Dani), 1 teacher, and 1 teacher\u2019s aid.  If 3 students called in sick that day, how many cupcakes are left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Dani brought in total. Two and a half dozen cupcakes is equal to 30 cupcakes (since a dozen is 12). Next, we need to figure out how many people will be receiving cupcakes. There are 27 students, 1 teacher, and 1 teacher's aid, for a total of 29 people. However, 3 students called in sick, so we need to subtract them from the total. 29 - 3 = 26 people receiving cupcakes. Now, we need to subtract 26 cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes Dani brought. 30 - 26 = 4 cupcakes left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: MIlle is making snack packs for her kindergarten class. She's going to divide 64 pretzels, four times as many goldfish, and 32 suckers into baggies for the 16 kids in the class. How many items does each baggie have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many goldfish there are. We know that there are four times as many goldfish as pretzels, so: 64 pretzels x 4 = 256 goldfish Next, we need to add up the total number of items: 64 pretzels + 256 goldfish + 32 suckers = 352 items Now we can divide the total number of items by the number of baggies: 352 items \u00f7 16 baggies = 22 items per baggie Therefore, each baggie will have 22 items, which includes pretzels, goldfish, and suckers. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Eric sorted 150 colored pencils into 5 containers for his art class. Before class, another teacher brought him 30 more pencils. How many can he evenly distribute between the five containers now?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of pencils Eric has now. To do this, we add the original 150 pencils to the 30 pencils brought by the other teacher: 150 + 30 = 180 So Eric now has 180 colored pencils. Next, we need to find out how many pencils he can evenly distribute between the five containers. To do this, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of containers: 180 \u00f7 5 = 36 Therefore, Eric can evenly distribute 36 colored pencils between each of the five containers. The answer is 36.\n\n\nQ: Gerald is a furniture maker. He has 672 pieces of wood and he wants to make some tables and chairs. It takes 12 pieces of wood to make a table and 8 pieces of wood to make a chair. How many chairs can he make if he makes 24 tables?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many pieces of wood Gerald will use to make 24 tables. To make one table, he needs 12 pieces of wood. So to make 24 tables, he will need: 12 x 24 = 288 pieces of wood Now, let's subtract the pieces of wood used for the tables from the total number of pieces of wood Gerald has: 672 - 288 = 384 pieces of wood left Finally, let's find out how many chairs Gerald can make with the remaining pieces of wood. To make one chair, he needs 8 pieces of wood. So the number of chairs he can make is: 384 \u00f7 8 = 48 chairs Therefore, Gerald can make 48 chairs if he makes 24 tables. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Ivan has 20 dice. Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. How many dice do they have altogether?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Ivan has 20 dice. Next, we know that Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. So, we can multiply Ivan's number of dice by 2 to find Jerry's number of dice: 20 x 2 = 40 Therefore, Jerry has 40 dice. To find the total number of dice they have altogether, we can add Ivan's and Jerry's number of dice: 20 + 40 = 60 Therefore, they have 60 dice altogether. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: There are 50 marbles in a box which has a mixture of white, red and blue marbles. There were originally 20 white marbles and an equal number of red and blue marbles. Jack removes a number of marbles equal to double the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles. How many marbles are left in the box?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 20 white marbles and an equal number of red and blue marbles. So, we can say that there are 20 white, 15 red, and 15 blue marbles in the box. Next, we need to find the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles. In this case, the difference is 20 - 15 = 5. Then, we need to double that difference, which gives us 5 x 2 = 10. Jack removes 10 marbles from the box. So, the number of marbles left in the box is 50 - 10 = 40 marbles. The answer is 40.\n\n\n"
