  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Jamie and Oliver are planning to go on a vacation. A plane ticket costs $24 for each person and a hotel stay costs $12 for each person per day. How much money will they spend on the vacation if they stay for 3 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets for both Jamie and Oliver. Since each ticket costs $24, the total cost of the tickets will be: $24 x 2 = $48 Next, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel stay. Since the cost is $12 per person per day, and they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel stay will be: $12 x 2 x 3 = $72 Finally, we need to add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay to get the total cost of the vacation: $48 + $72 = $120 Therefore, Jamie and Oliver will spend $120 on their vacation. The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: Samuel is going to the cinema with his brother, Kevin. They both have a total budget of $20 for their outing. Samuel buys his $14 ticket, then spends $6 on drinks and food. Kevin buys his ticket, then spends $2 on drinks. They have both used their entire budget. How much did Kevin spend on food?\nA: Let's think step by step. Samuel spent $14 on his ticket and $6 on food and drinks, which means he spent a total of $20. This means that Kevin must have spent $0 on food and drinks, since they both used their entire budget of $20. Therefore, Kevin spent $6 on his ticket and $2 on drinks, which means he spent a total of $8. Since he didn't spend any money on food, the answer is $0. The answer is 0.\n\n\nQ: Twenty people pre-bought plane tickets at a price of $155 per ticket. Thirty people bought their plane tickets at the gate and they each paid $200 for their ticket. How many more dollars did the people at the gate pay for their tickets than those passengers that pre-bought their tickets?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total cost of pre-bought tickets Twenty people pre-bought tickets at $155 per ticket, so the total cost is: 20 x $155 = $3100 Step 2: Find the total cost of tickets bought at the gate Thirty people bought tickets at $200 per ticket, so the total cost is: 30 x $200 = $6000 Step 3: Find the difference in cost between the two groups To find the difference, we subtract the total cost of pre-bought tickets from the total cost of tickets bought at the gate: $6000 - $3100 = $2900 Therefore, the people at the gate paid $2900 more for their tickets than those passengers that pre-bought their tickets. The answer is 2900.\n\n\nQ: Five people are planning a party. Sonja will buy a loaf of French bread ($3 a loaf) and a platter of cold cuts ($23). Barbara will buy the soda ($1 per person) and two boxes of crackers ($2 per box). Mario and Rick will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles ($3 per package). Danica will supply a package of paper plates for $4. How much more will Sonja spend than the rest of the office put together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of Barbara's contribution. She will buy soda for 5 people, which will cost $5 (1 dollar per person). She will also buy two boxes of crackers, which will cost $4 (2 dollars per box). Therefore, Barbara's total contribution will be $9. Next, let's calculate the total cost of Mario and Rick's contribution. They will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles, which will cost $6 in total (3 dollars per package). Now, let's add up the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's. Barbara's contribution is $9, Mario and Rick's contribution is $6, and Danica's contribution is $4. Therefore, the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's is $19. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of Sonja's contribution. She will buy a loaf of French bread for $3 and a platter of cold cuts for $23. Therefore, Sonja's total contribution will be $26. To find out how much more Sonja will spend than the rest of the office put together, we need to subtract the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's from Sonja's total contribution. $26 (Sonja's contribution) - $19 (total cost of everyone else's contribution) = $7 Therefore, Sonja will spend $7 more than the rest of the office put together. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: A bag of dozen apples costs $14 and Brian has already spent $10 on kiwis and half that much on bananas. What's the maximum number of apples Brian can buy if he left his house with only $50 and needs to pay the $3.50 subway fare each way?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much money Brian has left after paying for the subway fare. He needs to pay $3.50 each way, so that's a total of $7 for the round trip. Therefore, he has $50 - $7 = $43 left to spend on groceries. Next, we need to figure out how much money Brian has already spent on bananas. We know he spent half as much on bananas as he did on kiwis, and he spent $10 on kiwis. So he spent $10 / 2 = $5 on bananas. Now we can subtract the amount Brian has already spent on kiwis and bananas from the total amount he has left to spend on groceries: $43 - $10 - $5 = $28. Finally, we need to figure out how many bags of apples Brian can buy with $28. We know that one bag of apples costs $14, so we can divide $28 by $14 to get the maximum number of bags of apples Brian can buy: $28 / $14 = 2. Therefore, the maximum number of bags of apples Brian can buy is 2. Since each bag contains a dozen apples, he can buy a total of 2 x 12 = 24 apples. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Logan makes $65,000 a year. He spends $20,000 on rent every year, $5000 on groceries every year, and $8000 on gas every year. If he wants to have at least $42000 left, how much more money must he make each year?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how much Logan spends in total each year: $20,000 (rent) + $5,000 (groceries) + $8,000 (gas) = $33,000 Next, we need to subtract that amount from his annual income: $65,000 (income) - $33,000 (expenses) = $32,000 So Logan currently has $32,000 left after paying his expenses. However, he wants to have at least $42,000 left. Therefore, we need to calculate how much more money he needs to make each year: $42,000 (desired savings) - $32,000 (current savings) = $10,000 Therefore, Logan needs to make at least $10,000 more each year to reach his desired savings goal. The answer is 10000.\n\n\nQ: Mrs. Thomson received an incentive worth $240. She spent 1/3 of the money on food and 1/5 of it on clothes. Then, she put in her savings account 3/4 of the remaining money. How much money did Mrs. Thomson save?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Mrs. Thomson spent on food. We know that she spent 1/3 of the $240 incentive on food, so we can calculate: 1/3 x $240 = $80 Next, we need to find out how much money she spent on clothes. We know that she spent 1/5 of the $240 incentive on clothes, so we can calculate: 1/5 x $240 = $48 To find out how much money she had left after spending on food and clothes, we need to subtract the amounts she spent from the total incentive: $240 - $80 - $48 = $112 Now we know that Mrs. Thomson had $112 left. She put 3/4 of this amount into her savings account, so we can calculate: 3/4 x $112 = $84 Therefore, Mrs. Thomson saved $84. The answer is 84.\n\n\nQ: Kathleen saved $21 in June, $46 in July, and $45 in August. Then Kathleen spent $12 on school supplies and $54 on new clothes. Kathleen\u2019s aunt said she would give Kathleen $25 if Kathleen saves more than $125.  How much money does Kathleen have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total amount of money Kathleen saved in those three months. Total savings = $21 + $46 + $45 = $112 Next, we need to subtract the amount Kathleen spent on school supplies and new clothes. Total spent = $12 + $54 = $66 Kathleen's remaining savings = Total savings - Total spent = $112 - $66 = $46 Finally, we need to check if Kathleen saved more than $125 to see if she will receive the additional $25 from her aunt. Total savings + $25 > $125 $46 + $25 > $125 $71 > $125 (False) Since Kathleen did not save more than $125, she will not receive the additional $25 from her aunt. Therefore, Kathleen has $46 left. The answer is 46.\n\n\n"
