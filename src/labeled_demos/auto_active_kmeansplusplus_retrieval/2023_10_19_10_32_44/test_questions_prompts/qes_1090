  "test_question": "Q: A man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. How many sandwiches does this family eat in one week?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: There are four members in one household. Each member consumes 3 slices of bread during breakfast and 2 slices of bread for snacks. A loaf of bread has 12 slices. How many days will five loaves of bread last in this family?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of bread each member consumes per day. For breakfast, each member consumes 3 slices of bread. For snacks, each member consumes 2 slices of bread. So, in total, each member consumes 3 + 2 = 5 slices of bread per day. Since there are four members in the household, the total number of slices of bread consumed per day is 4 x 5 = 20 slices. Now, we need to find out how many days five loaves of bread will last. One loaf of bread has 12 slices, so five loaves of bread have 5 x 12 = 60 slices. If the family consumes 20 slices of bread per day, then 60 slices will last for 60/20 = 3 days. Therefore, five loaves of bread will last for 3 days in this family. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Shane prepares sandwiches for the Boy Scouts. He buys 2 packages of sliced bread containing 20 slices each, and he also buys 2 packages of sliced ham containing 8 slices each. Shane will make as many sandwiches as he can according to the ham he has. How many slices of bread will he have leftover?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of ham Shane has in total. 2 packages of sliced ham containing 8 slices each = 2 x 8 = 16 slices of ham Now, we know that Shane will make as many sandwiches as he can according to the ham he has. Since each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread, we can calculate the maximum number of sandwiches he can make: 16 slices of ham / 2 slices of bread per sandwich = 8 sandwiches So, Shane will make 8 sandwiches. Each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread, so he will use: 8 sandwiches x 2 slices of bread per sandwich = 16 slices of bread Shane has 2 packages of sliced bread containing 20 slices each, so he has: 2 packages x 20 slices per package = 40 slices of bread Therefore, he will have: 40 slices of bread - 16 slices of bread used = 24 slices of bread leftover. So, Shane will have 24 slices of bread leftover. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Sandra eats 3 beignets every morning.  How many beignets will she eat in 16 weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many beignets Sandra eats in one week. To do this, we can multiply the number of beignets she eats in one day (3) by the number of days in a week (7): 3 beignets/day x 7 days/week = 21 beignets/week So Sandra eats 21 beignets in one week. Next, we need to find out how many beignets she will eat in 16 weeks. To do this, we can multiply the number of beignets she eats in one week (21) by the number of weeks (16): 21 beignets/week x 16 weeks = 336 beignets Therefore, Sandra will eat 336 beignets in 16 weeks. The answer is 16.\n\n\nQ: In preparation for the church fundraiser, Julia bakes one less than 5 cakes per day for 6 days.  Unfortunately, every other day, Julia's brother, Clifford, sneaks into Julia's house and eats one of Julia's cakes.  At the end of 6 days, how many cakes does Julia have remaining?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cakes Julia bakes per day. We know that she bakes one less than 5 cakes per day, so that means she bakes 4 cakes per day. Next, we need to figure out how many cakes Julia bakes in total over the 6 days. To do this, we can multiply the number of cakes she bakes per day (4) by the number of days she bakes (6): 4 cakes/day x 6 days = 24 cakes So Julia bakes a total of 24 cakes over the 6 days. Now we need to figure out how many cakes Clifford eats. We know that he eats one of Julia's cakes every other day, so that means he eats 3 cakes over the 6 days (since there are 3 pairs of days where he eats a cake). Finally, we can subtract the number of cakes Clifford eats from the total number of cakes Julia bakes to find out how many cakes she has remaining: 24 cakes - 3 cakes = 21 cakes So Julia has 21 cakes remaining at the end of the 6 days. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Jeremy buys 30 watermelons. He eats 3 watermelons per week. Each week he gives 2 to his dad. How many weeks will the watermelons last?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many watermelons Jeremy eats per week and how many he gives to his dad. Jeremy eats 3 watermelons per week and gives 2 to his dad, so he uses a total of 5 watermelons per week. Next, we need to divide the total number of watermelons by the number of watermelons used per week to find out how many weeks the watermelons will last. 30 watermelons \u00f7 5 watermelons per week = 6 weeks Therefore, the watermelons will last for 6 weeks. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Alex was having a cookout Friday night and planned to serve burgers to his guests.  He planned to cook 3 burgers for each guest and had invited 10 friends over.  1 of his friends didn't eat meat and said they would bring their own food.  Another one of his friends didn't eat bread and would not need the buns.  The burger buns came 8 to a pack.  How many packs of buns did Alex need to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many guests will be eating burgers. Alex invited 10 friends, but one won't be eating meat, so there will be 9 guests eating burgers. Next, we need to figure out how many burgers Alex will need to cook. He plans to cook 3 burgers for each guest, so he will need to cook 3 x 9 = 27 burgers. Now we need to figure out how many buns Alex will need. Each burger needs 2 buns, but one of his friends won't be eating the buns, so he will only need 2 x 26 = 52 buns. Since the buns come 8 to a pack, we need to divide 52 by 8 to find out how many packs of buns Alex needs to buy. 52 \u00f7 8 = 6.5 Since we can't buy half a pack of buns, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So Alex needs to buy 7 packs of buns. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: John takes a pill every 6 hours.  How many pills does he take a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 24 hours in a day, so John takes 24/6 = 4 pills per day. In a week, there are 7 days, so John takes 4 x 7 = 28 pills per week. The answer is 28.\n\n\nQ: Each week Jaime saves $50. Every two weeks she spends $46 of her savings on a nice lunch with her mum. How long will it take her to save $135?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much money Jaime saves in a week after spending $46 every two weeks on lunch with her mom. In two weeks, Jaime spends $46 on lunch, so in one week, she spends $23 on lunch. Therefore, Jaime saves $50 - $23 = $27 per week. Next, we need to figure out how many weeks it will take Jaime to save $135. We can set up an equation: $27 per week x number of weeks = $135 To solve for the number of weeks, we can divide both sides by $27: number of weeks = $135 / $27 number of weeks = 5 Therefore, it will take Jaime 5 weeks to save $135. The answer is 135.\n\n\n"
