  "test_question": "Q: Although Soledad works in a windowless office, she loves the outdoors. She will be on vacation for the entire month of June and cannot wait to hike 9,300 miles within that month. She is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time.

  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Every Monday to Friday morning, Alice walks 10 miles through a large grass field to get to school. To avoid the hot afternoon sun on her way home, she walks 12 miles through a forest. When she gets home on Friday, how many miles will she have walked that week?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. Alice walks 10 miles every morning from Monday to Friday. So, in total, she walks 10 x 5 = 50 miles during the weekdays. On her way back home, she walks 12 miles every afternoon from Monday to Friday. So, in total, she walks 12 x 5 = 60 miles during the weekdays. Therefore, the total distance Alice walks during the weekdays is 50 + 60 = 110 miles. Since the problem asks for the total distance Alice walks in a week, we need to add the distance she walks on Saturday and Sunday as well. Let's assume Alice doesn't walk to school on weekends. So, the total distance she walks on weekends is 0. Therefore, the total distance Alice walks in a week is 110 + 0 + 0 = 110 miles. The answer is 110.\n\n\nQ: Eliana walked 200 steps for her morning exercise, did some press-ups, then added some 300 more steps to her count for the first day. The next day, she walked twice the number of steps she walked on the first day.  And on the third day, Eliana walked an additional 100 steps. What's the total number of steps Eliana walked during these three days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Eliana walked 200 + 300 = 500 steps. On the second day, she walked twice the number of steps she walked on the first day, which is 2 * 500 = 1000 steps. On the third day, she walked an additional 100 steps. Therefore, the total number of steps Eliana walked during these three days is 500 + 1000 + 100 = 1600 steps. The answer is 1600.\n\n\nQ: Richard starts walking from Cincinnati to New York City, which is 70 miles. Richards walks 20 miles the first day. The next day he walks 6 miles less than half as much as he walked the first day. He walks 10 miles the third day. How many miles further does Richard have to walk to be in New York City?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Richard walks 20 miles. On the second day, he walks 6 miles less than half as much as he walked the first day. Half of what he walked on the first day is 20/2 = 10 miles. So, he walks 10 - 6 = 4 miles on the second day. On the third day, he walks 10 miles. Therefore, the total distance Richard has walked so far is 20 + 4 + 10 = 34 miles. To reach New York City, which is 70 miles away, Richard still has to walk 70 - 34 = 36 miles further. The answer is 36.\n\n\nQ: Talia is playing football with her friends. The park they're playing at is 5 miles from Talia's house. After their game, Talia is planning to go to the grocery store 3 miles away from the park and 8 miles from her home. Starting and ending at Talia's house, how many miles does Talia drive that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Talia drives 5 miles from her house to the park. Then, she drives 3 miles from the park to the grocery store. Finally, she drives 8 miles from the grocery store back to her house. To find the total distance Talia drives that day, we can add up these three distances: 5 miles + 3 miles + 8 miles = 16 miles Therefore, Talia drives a total of 16 miles that day. The answer is 16.\n\n\nQ: Francine drives 140km to work each day. If she does not go to work 3 days every week, find the total distance she drives to work for 4 weeks in kilometers.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days Francine goes to work in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 x 7 = 28 days. If Francine does not go to work 3 days every week, then she goes to work 7 - 3 = 4 days every week. So in 4 weeks, she goes to work 4 x 4 = 16 days. Now we can find the total distance she drives to work in 4 weeks by multiplying the distance she drives to work each day by the number of days she goes to work in 4 weeks. Total distance = 140 km/day x 16 days = 2240 km Therefore, Francine drives a total of 2240 kilometers to work in 4 weeks. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Stephen made 10 round trips up and down a 40,000 foot tall mountain. If he reached 3/4 of the mountain's height on each of his trips, calculate the total distance he covered.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much of the mountain Stephen climbed on each trip. If he reached 3/4 of the mountain's height on each trip, we can calculate this by multiplying the mountain's height by 3/4: 3/4 * 40,000 = 30,000 feet So Stephen climbed 30,000 feet on each trip. Since he made 10 round trips, we can multiply this by 20 to find out how much he climbed in total: 30,000 * 20 = 600,000 feet Therefore, Stephen covered a total distance of 600,000 feet. The answer is 600000.\n\n\nQ: Billy and Tiffany are having a contest to see how can run the most miles in a week. On Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, Billy runs 1 mile each day and Tiffany runs 2 miles each day. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, Billy runs 1 mile each day and Tiffany runs a 1/3 of a mile each day. On Saturday Tiffany assumes she's going to win and takes the day off. How many miles does Billy have to run on Saturday to tie Tiffany?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how many miles Billy and Tiffany run from Sunday to Friday: Billy: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 miles Tiffany: 2 + 2 + 2 + 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 6 2/3 miles So, by Friday, Tiffany is ahead by 2/3 of a mile. To tie Tiffany, Billy needs to run 2/3 of a mile on Saturday. Therefore, Billy needs to run 0.67 miles on Saturday to tie Tiffany. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Ann can skate 6 miles an hour. Her friend Glenda can skate 8 miles an hour. If they start in the same place and skate in straight lines in opposite directions for 3 hours, how many miles apart do they end up?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how far Ann and Glenda each skate in 3 hours. Ann: 6 miles/hour x 3 hours = 18 miles Glenda: 8 miles/hour x 3 hours = 24 miles Step 2: Add the distances they each skated to find the total distance between them. 18 miles + 24 miles = 42 miles Therefore, Ann and Glenda end up 42 miles apart after skating in opposite directions for 3 hours. The answer is 3.\n\n\n"
