Answer Choices: (A) 7+15+9 (B) 6+15+9 (C) 6+14+9 (D) 6+15+8 (E) 8+15+9\nA: Let's think step by step. Correct Answer : B 3x+15+9=30 3x =3*2*1 =6 therefore :- 6+15+9= 30 The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If the LCM of 9, 7, 2, and q is 504, which of the following could be q? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 6 (D) 9 (E) 5\nA: Let's think step by step. Using elimination method, eliminate the option to arrive at 8 if x is replaced by 8 and the LCM is calculated you arrive at 504 B The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In a certain country \u00bd of 5 = 3. Assuming the same proportion, what would be the value of 1/3 of 10 ? Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 8 (D) 7 (E) 9\nA: Let's think step by step.
