  "test_question": "Q: What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729. Answer Choices: (A) 37 (B) 38 (C) 36 (D) 30 (E) 39",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: what is the smallest number should be added to 5377 so that the sum is completely divisible by 7? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 4 (C) 6 (D) 2 (E) 1\nA: Let's think step by step. Solution: Divide 5377 with 7 we get remainder as 1. so, add 6 to the given number so that it will divisible by 7. Answer C The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: How many positive integers less than 5,000 are evenly divisible by neither 17 nor 21? Answer Choices: (A) 4,514 (B) 4,480 (C) 4,521 (D) 4,428 (E) 4,349\nA: Let's think step by step. integers less than 5000 divisible by 17 5000/17 =333.something , so 333 integers less than 5000 divisible by 21 5000/21 = 238.## , so 238 we have double counted some, so take LCM of 17 and 21 =105 and divide by 5000, we get 47. so all numbers divisible by 17 and 21 = 333 +238 -47 =524 now subtract that from 4999. 4999- 524 = 4480 answer B. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: you need to pict any number from 1, 3,5,7,9,11,13 and 15 to make below equation true.\n()+()+()=30\ncan you solve it? Answer Choices: (A) 7+15+9 (B) 6+15+9 (C) 6+14+9 (D) 6+15+8 (E) 8+15+9\nA: Let's think step by step. Correct Answer : B 3x+15+9=30 3x =3*2*1 =6 therefore :- 6+15+9= 30 The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: How many two-element subsets of <1, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9> are there that do not contain the pair of elements 2 and 4? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 22 (C) 24 (D) 35 (E) 36\nA: Let's think step by step. 9C2 - 1 = 35 Answer is D The answer is D.\n\n\n"
