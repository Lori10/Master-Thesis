Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Three friends-whose walking rates are 1 ft./sec., 3ft./sec.,and 6ft./sec. start together walking in the same direction around a circular track that is 420 feet in circumference.After how many minutes are the three of them together again? Answer Choices: (A) 5 mins (B) 10 mins (C) 15 mins (D) 3 mins (E) 7 mins\nA: Let's think step by step. The time they take will be what the 1st friend takes to complete one circumference as he is the slowest and that is the point all 3 of them will be together at the end of 7 mins. E The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A train 440 meters long is running with a speed of 50 kmph. The time taken by it to cross a tunnel 180 meters long is? Answer Choices: (A) 40.33 sec (B) 41.33 sec (C) 42.33 sec (D) 40 sec (E) 44.64 sec\nA: Let's think step by step. D = 440 + 180 =620 S = 50 * 5/18 = 13.88889 mps T = 620/13.88889 = 44.64 E The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Five drainage pipes, each draining water from a pool at the same constant rate, together can drain a certain pool in 12 days. How many additional pipes, each draining water at the same constant rate, will be needed to drain the pool in 6 days? Answer Choices: (A)  5 (B)  9 (C)  10 (D)  12 (E)  15\nA: Let's think step by step. This is an inverse proportional problem...... 5 pipes in 12 days; So for 6 days, it will be = 12 x 5 / 6 = 10 So, 10-5 = 5 Answer A The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Two taps can separately fill a cistern 10 minutes and 15 minutes respectively and when the waste pipe is open, they can together fill it in 18 minutes. The waste pipe can empty the full cistern in? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 6 (C) 7 (D) 9 (E) 1\nA: Let's think step by step. 1/10 + 1/15 - 1/x = 1/18 x = 9 Answer: D The answer is D.\n\n\n"
