  "test_question": "Q: There is a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. If five registered voters are chosen at random, what is the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted in the last election? Answer Choices: (A) 26.2% (B) 32.8% (C) 43.7% (D) 59.0% (E) 65.6%",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A box contains five bulbs out of which 3 are defective. If four bulbs are chosen at random, find the probability that atleast one bulb is good. Answer Choices: (A) 39/10 (B) 29/10 (C) 19/10 (D) 9/10 (E) 125/128\nA: Let's think step by step. Required probability = 1 - 1/10 = 9/10 Answer: D The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: In a certain country \u00bd of 5 = 3. Assuming the same proportion, what would be the value of 1/3 of 10 ? Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 8 (D) 7 (E) 9\nA: Let's think step by step. B 4 The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Given a bag with 2 red balls and 3 yellow balls, you randomly select one of them, in order. If the second ball you take is yellow, what is the probability that the first one was also yellow? Answer Choices: (A) 1/2 (B) 1/5 (C) 3/4 (D) 1/3 (E) 3/5\nA: Let's think step by step. This is a conditional probability question. Basically we are told that out of 2 balls picked one is yellow and are asked to find the probability of the other one also to be yellow. So, possible options for this other ball would be: W, W, B, B (as one yellow is already picked) So the probability for that ball to be yellow too is 2/4=1/2. Option A The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The average of 20 numbers is zero. Of them, at the most, how many may be greater than zero? Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 10 (D) 19 (E) None of the above\nA: Let's think step by step. Average of 20 numbers = 0. \u2234 Sum of 20 numbers = (0 \u00d7 20) = 0. It is quite possible that 19 of these numbers may be positive and if their sum is a, then 20th number is (\u2013a). Answer D The answer is D.\n\n\n"
