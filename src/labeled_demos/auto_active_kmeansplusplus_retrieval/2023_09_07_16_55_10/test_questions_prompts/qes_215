Answer Choices: (A) 4,514 (B) 4,480 (C) 4,521 (D) 4,428 (E) 4,349\nA: Let's think step by step. integers less than 5000 divisible by 17 5000/17 =333.something , so 333 integers less than 5000 divisible by 21 5000/21 = 238.## , so 238 we have double counted some, so take LCM of 17 and 21 =105 and divide by 5000, we get 47. so all numbers divisible by 17 and 21 = 333 +238 -47 =524 now subtract that from 4999. 4999- 524 = 4480 answer B. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: what is the smallest number should be added to 5377 so that the sum is completely divisible by 7? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 4 (C) 6 (D) 2 (E) 1\nA: Let's think step by step. Solution: Divide 5377 with 7 we get remainder as 1. so, add 6 to the given number so that it will divisible by 7. Answer C The answer is C.\n\n\n"
