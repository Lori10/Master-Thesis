  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Three friends-whose walking rates are 1 ft./sec., 3ft./sec.,and 6ft./sec. start together walking in the same direction around a circular track that is 420 feet in circumference.After how many minutes are the three of them together again? Answer Choices: (A) 5 mins (B) 10 mins (C) 15 mins (D) 3 mins (E) 7 mins\nA: Let's think step by step. The time they take will be what the 1st friend takes to complete one circumference as he is the slowest and that is the point all 3 of them will be together at the end of 7 mins. E The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A train 440 meters long is running with a speed of 50 kmph. The time taken by it to cross a tunnel 180 meters long is? Answer Choices: (A) 40.33 sec (B) 41.33 sec (C) 42.33 sec (D) 40 sec (E) 44.64 sec\nA: Let's think step by step. D = 440 + 180 =620 S = 50 * 5/18 = 13.88889 mps T = 620/13.88889 = 44.64 E The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: One fill pipe A is 3 times faster than second fill pipe B and takes 10 minutes less time to fill a cistern than B takes.

Let B can fill the cistern in x min. Then, then A can fill the cistern in x\u20443 min Given x - x\u20443 = 10 \u21d2 x = 15 min Answer C The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The average of temperatures at noontime from Monday to Friday is 40; the lowest one is 30, what is the possible maximum range of the temperatures? Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 25 (C) 50 (D) 45 (E) 75\nA: Let's think step by step. Average=40, Sum of temperatures=40*5=200 As the min temperature is 30, max would be 200-4*30=80 --> The range=80(max)-30(min)=50 Answer: C The answer is C.\n\n\n"
