  "test_question": "Q: If 6x - y = 24 and y = 3x, what is the value of x? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 9 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: One half of a two digit number exceeds its one third by 6. What is the sum of the digits of the number? Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 5 (C) 7 (D) 9 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. x/2 \u2013 x/3 = 6 => x =6 3 + 6 = 9 ANSWER:D The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: y = 248 - 198x\nWhich of the following values of x gives the greatest value of y in the equation above? Answer Choices: (A)  200 (B)  100 (C)  0.5 (D)  -5 (E)  4\nA: Let's think step by step. Clearly, the negative value of x will result in maximum value of y. Don't even look at the rest of the answer choices as only one negative value is being present. Answer is D The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If (x^2 + 1)y=8, which of the following is not a possible value for y? Answer Choices: (A) 8/2 (B) 2/5 (C) 18/3 (D) 3 (E) 17/2\nA: Let's think step by step. Its simple equation is (x^2 +1)y = 8 ===> x^2 = (8/y) - 1 . As , in LHS, it is x^2 the value has to be positive or zero in RHS. Hence, (8/y) - 1>= 0 ===> y =< 8. Now only option E has greater value of 'y' than 8. Thus, correct ans is E The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: If x is an odd integer and y = 3x + 2, which of the following CANNOT be a divisor of y? Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 5 (C) 14 (D) 17 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. x takes odd values as 1,3,5,7., y=3x+2 x is an odd term so 3x must be an odd term when it adds with 2 so it must be a odd integer 14 didn't follows this condition ans is C The answer is C.\n\n\n"
