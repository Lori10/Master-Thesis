  "test_question": "Q: The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers? Answer Choices: (A) 47 (B) 91 (C) 41 (D) 67 (E) 44",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If x is an odd integer and y = 3x + 2, which of the following CANNOT be a divisor of y? Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 5 (C) 14 (D) 17 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. x takes odd values as 1,3,5,7., y=3x+2 x is an odd term so 3x must be an odd term when it adds with 2 so it must be a odd integer 14 didn't follows this condition ans is C The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Which of the following number will completely divide (49^15)-1? Answer Choices: (A) 8 is the number (B) 6 (C) 22 (D) 12 (E) 14\nA: Let's think step by step. x^n - 1 will be divisible by x+1 only when n is even. 49^15 - 1 = (7^2)^15 - 1 = 7^30 - 1 which is divisible by 7+1 i.e. 8 Answer is A The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: what is the smallest number should be added to 5377 so that the sum is completely divisible by 7? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 4 (C) 6 (D) 2 (E) 1\nA: Let's think step by step. Solution: Divide 5377 with 7 we get remainder as 1. so, add 6 to the given number so that it will divisible by 7. Answer C The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: How many positive integers less than 5,000 are evenly divisible by neither 17 nor 21? Answer Choices: (A) 4,514 (B) 4,480 (C) 4,521 (D) 4,428 (E) 4,349\nA: Let's think step by step. integers less than 5000 divisible by 17 5000/17 =333.something , so 333 integers less than 5000 divisible by 21 5000/21 = 238.## , so 238 we have double counted some, so take LCM of 17 and 21 =105 and divide by 5000, we get 47. so all numbers divisible by 17 and 21 = 333 +238 -47 =524 now subtract that from 4999. 4999- 524 = 4480 answer B. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
