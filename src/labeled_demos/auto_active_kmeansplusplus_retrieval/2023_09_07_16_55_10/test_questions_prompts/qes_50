  "test_question": "Q: If one of the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 is 1.5, then what is the value of m? Answer Choices: (A) -23.5 (B) -17.5 (C) -10.5 (D) -16.2 (E) Cannot be determined",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If (x^2 + 1)y=8, which of the following is not a possible value for y? Answer Choices: (A) 8/2 (B) 2/5 (C) 18/3 (D) 3 (E) 17/2\nA: Let's think step by step. Its simple equation is (x^2 +1)y = 8 ===> x^2 = (8/y) - 1 . As , in LHS, it is x^2 the value has to be positive or zero in RHS. Hence, (8/y) - 1>= 0 ===> y =< 8. Now only option E has greater value of 'y' than 8. Thus, correct ans is E The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: (ab)x\u22122=(ba)x\u22127. What is the value of x ? Answer Choices: (A) 1.5 (B) 4.5 (C) 7.5 (D) 9.5 (E) 8.7\nA: Let's think step by step. Explanation: (a/b)x\u22122=(b/a)x\u22127\u21d2(a/b)x\u22122=(a/b)\u2212(x\u22127)\u21d2x\u22122=\u2212(x\u22127)\u21d2x\u22122=\u2212x+7\u21d2x\u22122=\u2212x+7\u21d22x=9\u21d2x=92=4.5 Option B The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Which of the following number will completely divide (49^15)-1? Answer Choices: (A) 8 is the number (B) 6 (C) 22 (D) 12 (E) 14\nA: Let's think step by step. x^n - 1 will be divisible by x+1 only when n is even. 49^15 - 1 = (7^2)^15 - 1 = 7^30 - 1 which is divisible by 7+1 i.e. 8 Answer is A The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: y = 248 - 198x\nWhich of the following values of x gives the greatest value of y in the equation above? Answer Choices: (A)  200 (B)  100 (C)  0.5 (D)  -5 (E)  4\nA: Let's think step by step. Clearly, the negative value of x will result in maximum value of y. Don't even look at the rest of the answer choices as only one negative value is being present. Answer is D The answer is D.\n\n\n"
