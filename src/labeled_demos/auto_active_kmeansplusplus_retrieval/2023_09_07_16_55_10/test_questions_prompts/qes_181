  "test_question": "Q: The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000 and the sum of the numbers is 1000. The numbers are Answer Choices: (A) 600, 400 (B) 628, 372 (C) 640, 360 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: 108 \u00c3\u2014 108 + 92 \u00c3\u2014 92 = ? Answer Choices: (A) 20120 (B) 11500 (C) 20128 (D) 20660 (E) 20228\nA: Let's think step by step. Explanation : (a + b)2 + (a \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 b)2 = 2(a2 + b2) (Reference : Basic Algebraic Formulas) 1082 + 922 = (100 + 8)2 + (100 \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 8)2 = 2(1002 + 82) = 2(10000 + 64) = 20128. Answer : Option C The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: How many positive integers less than 5,000 are evenly divisible by neither 17 nor 21? Answer Choices: (A) 4,514 (B) 4,480 (C) 4,521 (D) 4,428 (E) 4,349\nA: Let's think step by step. integers less than 5000 divisible by 17 5000/17 =333.something , so 333 integers less than 5000 divisible by 21 5000/21 = 238.## , so 238 we have double counted some, so take LCM of 17 and 21 =105 and divide by 5000, we get 47. so all numbers divisible by 17 and 21 = 333 +238 -47 =524 now subtract that from 4999. 4999- 524 = 4480 answer B. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Which of these expressions has the greatest value? Answer Choices: (A) 1532672/1532676 (B) 1423765/1423769 (C) 1215672/1205679 (D) 1823561/1823566 (E) 1237842/1788545\nA: Let's think step by step. Using elimination method on options 1215672/1205679 = 1.00828827574... ANSWER:B The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: One half of a two digit number exceeds its one third by 6. What is the sum of the digits of the number? Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 5 (C) 7 (D) 9 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. x/2 \u2013 x/3 = 6 => x =6 3 + 6 = 9 ANSWER:D The answer is D.\n\n\n"
