  "test_question": "Q: Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: One fill pipe A is 3 times faster than second fill pipe B and takes 10 minutes less time to fill a cistern than B takes. Find when the cistern will be full if fill pipe B is only opened. Answer Choices: (A) 20 min (B) 18 min (C) 15 min (D) 10 min (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Let B can fill the cistern in x min. Then, then A can fill the cistern in x\u20443 min Given x - x\u20443 = 10 \u21d2 x = 15 min Answer C The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Five drainage pipes, each draining water from a pool at the same constant rate, together can drain a certain pool in 12 days. How many additional pipes, each draining water at the same constant rate, will be needed to drain the pool in 6 days? Answer Choices: (A)  5 (B)  9 (C)  10 (D)  12 (E)  15\nA: Let's think step by step. This is an inverse proportional problem...... 5 pipes in 12 days; So for 6 days, it will be = 12 x 5 / 6 = 10 So, 10-5 = 5 Answer A The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Two taps can separately fill a cistern 10 minutes and 15 minutes respectively and when the waste pipe is open, they can together fill it in 18 minutes. The waste pipe can empty the full cistern in? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 6 (C) 7 (D) 9 (E) 1\nA: Let's think step by step. 1/10 + 1/15 - 1/x = 1/18 x = 9 Answer: D The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Three friends-whose walking rates are 1 ft./sec., 3ft./sec.,and 6ft./sec. start together walking in the same direction around a circular track that is 420 feet in circumference.After how many minutes are the three of them together again? Answer Choices: (A) 5 mins (B) 10 mins (C) 15 mins (D) 3 mins (E) 7 mins\nA: Let's think step by step. The time they take will be what the 1st friend takes to complete one circumference as he is the slowest and that is the point all 3 of them will be together at the end of 7 mins. E The answer is E.\n\n\n"
