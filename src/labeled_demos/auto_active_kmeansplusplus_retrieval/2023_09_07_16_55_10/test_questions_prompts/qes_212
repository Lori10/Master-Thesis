  "formatted_prompt": "Q: you need to pict any number from 1, 3,5,7,9,11,13 and 15 to make below equation true.\n()+()+()=30\ncan you solve it? Answer Choices: (A) 7+15+9 (B) 6+15+9 (C) 6+14+9 (D) 6+15+8 (E) 8+15+9\nA: Let's think step by step. Correct Answer : B 3x+15+9=30 3x =3*2*1 =6 therefore :- 6+15+9= 30 The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If the LCM of 9, 7, 2, and q is 504, which of the following could be q? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 6 (D) 9 (E) 5\nA: Let's think step by step. Using elimination method, eliminate the option to arrive at 8 if x is replaced by 8 and the LCM is calculated you arrive at 504 B The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: One half of a two digit number exceeds its one third by 6. What is the sum of the digits of the number? Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 5 (C) 7 (D) 9 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. x/2 \u2013 x/3 = 6 => x =6 3 + 6 = 9 ANSWER:D The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Which of the following number will completely divide (49^15)-1? Answer Choices: (A) 8 is the number (B) 6 (C) 22 (D) 12 (E) 14\nA: Let's think step by step. x^n - 1 will be divisible by x+1 only when n is even. 49^15 - 1 = (7^2)^15 - 1 = 7^30 - 1 which is divisible by 7+1 i.e. 8 Answer is A The answer is A.\n\n\n"
