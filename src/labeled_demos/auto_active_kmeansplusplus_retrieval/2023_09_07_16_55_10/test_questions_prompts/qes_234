  "test_question": "Q: If Q, a positive integer, has 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q?\nI. Q is the square of a prime number.\nII. Q is the fourth power of a prime number.\nIII. Q is the product of two prime numbers. Answer Choices: (A) I only (B) III only (C) II only (D) I and II only (E) I and III only",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Which of the following number will completely divide (49^15)-1? Answer Choices: (A) 8 is the number (B) 6 (C) 22 (D) 12 (E) 14\nA: Let's think step by step. x^n - 1 will be divisible by x+1 only when n is even. 49^15 - 1 = (7^2)^15 - 1 = 7^30 - 1 which is divisible by 7+1 i.e. 8 Answer is A The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: If x is an odd integer and y = 3x + 2, which of the following CANNOT be a divisor of y? Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 5 (C) 14 (D) 17 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. x takes odd values as 1,3,5,7., y=3x+2 x is an odd term so 3x must be an odd term when it adds with 2 so it must be a odd integer 14 didn't follows this condition ans is C The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In a certain country \u00bd of 5 = 3. Assuming the same proportion, what would be the value of 1/3 of 10 ? Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 8 (D) 7 (E) 9\nA: Let's think step by step. B 4 The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If the LCM of 9, 7, 2, and q is 504, which of the following could be q? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 6 (D) 9 (E) 5\nA: Let's think step by step. Using elimination method, eliminate the option to arrive at 8 if x is replaced by 8 and the LCM is calculated you arrive at 504 B The answer is B.\n\n\n"
