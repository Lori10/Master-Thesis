Answer Choices: (A) 1532672/1532676 (B) 1423765/1423769 (C) 1215672/1205679 (D) 1823561/1823566 (E) 1237842/1788545\nA: Let's think step by step. Using elimination method on options 1215672/1205679 = 1.00828827574... ANSWER:B The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: How many positive integers less than 5,000 are evenly divisible by neither 17 nor 21? Answer Choices: (A) 4,514 (B) 4,480 (C) 4,521 (D) 4,428 (E) 4,349\nA: Let's think step by step. integers less than 5000 divisible by 17 5000/17 =333.something , so 333 integers less than 5000 divisible by 21 5000/21 = 238.## , so 238 we have double counted some, so take LCM of 17 and 21 =105 and divide by 5000, we get 47. so all numbers divisible by 17 and 21 = 333 +238 -47 =524 now subtract that from 4999. 4999- 524 = 4480 answer B. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Rahul can do a work in 3 days while Rajesh can do the same work in 2days. Both of them finish the work together and get $250. What is the share of Rahul?
