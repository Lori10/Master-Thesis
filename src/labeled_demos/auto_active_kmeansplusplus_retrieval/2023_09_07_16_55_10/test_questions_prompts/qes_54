  "test_question": "Q: A bag contains 11 candy bars: three cost 50 cents each, four cost $1 each and four cost $2\neach. How many ways can 3 candy bars be selected from the 11 candy bars so that the total cost is more than $4? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 28 (C) 46 (D) 66 (E) 70",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In a certain country \u00bd of 5 = 3. Assuming the same proportion, what would be the value of 1/3 of 10 ? Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 8 (D) 7 (E) 9\nA: Let's think step by step. B 4 The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Given a bag with 2 red balls and 3 yellow balls, you randomly select one of them, in order. If the second ball you take is yellow, what is the probability that the first one was also yellow? Answer Choices: (A) 1/2 (B) 1/5 (C) 3/4 (D) 1/3 (E) 3/5\nA: Let's think step by step. This is a conditional probability question. Basically we are told that out of 2 balls picked one is yellow and are asked to find the probability of the other one also to be yellow. So, possible options for this other ball would be: W, W, B, B (as one yellow is already picked) So the probability for that ball to be yellow too is 2/4=1/2. Option A The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A box contains five bulbs out of which 3 are defective. If four bulbs are chosen at random, find the probability that atleast one bulb is good. Answer Choices: (A) 39/10 (B) 29/10 (C) 19/10 (D) 9/10 (E) 125/128\nA: Let's think step by step. Required probability = 1 - 1/10 = 9/10 Answer: D The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Certain number of worms are placed in a container. The number of worms increases by three times every day and the container is completely filled with worms in 12 days. On what day, the worms were\n1/3rd of the container ? Answer Choices: (A) 9 days (B) 3 days (C) 4 days (D) 11 days (E) 14 days\nA: Let's think step by step. As every day the worms increases by 3 times 1/3 \u00d7 3 = 1 [full] Therefore on 11th day Option D The answer is D.\n\n\n"
