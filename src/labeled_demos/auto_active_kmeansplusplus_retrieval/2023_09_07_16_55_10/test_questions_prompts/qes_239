  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Certain number of worms are placed in a container. The number of worms increases by three times every day and the container is completely filled with worms in 12 days. On what day, the worms were\n1/3rd of the container ? Answer Choices: (A) 9 days (B) 3 days (C) 4 days (D) 11 days (E) 14 days\nA: Let's think step by step. As every day the worms increases by 3 times 1/3 \u00d7 3 = 1 [full] Therefore on 11th day Option D The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A box contains five bulbs out of which 3 are defective.

Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 10 (D) 19 (E) None of the above\nA: Let's think step by step. Average of 20 numbers = 0. \u2234 Sum of 20 numbers = (0 \u00d7 20) = 0. It is quite possible that 19 of these numbers may be positive and if their sum is a, then 20th number is (\u2013a). Answer D The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: In a certain country \u00bd of 5 = 3. Assuming the same proportion, what would be the value of 1/3 of 10 ? Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 8 (D) 7 (E) 9\nA: Let's think step by step. B 4 The answer is B.\n\n\n"
