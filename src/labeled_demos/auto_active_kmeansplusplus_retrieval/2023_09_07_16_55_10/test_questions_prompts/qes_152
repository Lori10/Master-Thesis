  "test_question": "Q: The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number. Answer Choices: (A) 368 (B) 377 (C) 288 (D) 997 (E) 112",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: what is the smallest number should be added to 5377 so that the sum is completely divisible by 7? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 4 (C) 6 (D) 2 (E) 1\nA: Let's think step by step. Solution: Divide 5377 with 7 we get remainder as 1. so, add 6 to the given number so that it will divisible by 7. Answer C The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: How many positive integers less than 5,000 are evenly divisible by neither 17 nor 21? Answer Choices: (A) 4,514 (B) 4,480 (C) 4,521 (D) 4,428 (E) 4,349\nA: Let's think step by step. integers less than 5000 divisible by 17 5000/17 =333.something , so 333 integers less than 5000 divisible by 21 5000/21 = 238.## , so 238 we have double counted some, so take LCM of 17 and 21 =105 and divide by 5000, we get 47. so all numbers divisible by 17 and 21 = 333 +238 -47 =524 now subtract that from 4999. 4999- 524 = 4480 answer B. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: 56: 65 :: 68 :? Answer Choices: (A) 49 (B) 84 (C) 86 (D) 64 (E) 56\nA: Let's think step by step. Ans 86 Reverse of 68 ANSWER:C The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: One half of a two digit number exceeds its one third by 6. What is the sum of the digits of the number? Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 5 (C) 7 (D) 9 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. x/2 \u2013 x/3 = 6 => x =6 3 + 6 = 9 ANSWER:D The answer is D.\n\n\n"
