  "test_question": "Q: What is the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 7 (C) 3 (D) 8 (E) 12",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If k is an integer and 0.0010101 x 10^k is greater than 100, what is the least possible value of k? Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 4 (D) 5 (E) 6\nA: Let's think step by step. 0.0010101 * 10^k > 100 We need to move the decimal point to the right 5 places to get 101.01 This is equivalent to multiplying by 10^5. The answer is D. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If x is an odd integer and y = 3x + 2, which of the following CANNOT be a divisor of y? Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 5 (C) 14 (D) 17 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. x takes odd values as 1,3,5,7., y=3x+2 x is an odd term so 3x must be an odd term when it adds with 2 so it must be a odd integer 14 didn't follows this condition ans is C The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The sides of a rectangular region measured to the nearest centimeter are 8 cm and 5 cm. Out of the following which is the largest possible value of actual area of rectangle ? Answer Choices: (A) 48 (B) 55.25 (C) 52.29 (D) 44 (E) 41.25\nA: Let's think step by step. acan be anywhere between 7.5 and 8.4 andbcan be anywhere between 4.5 and 5.4. Hence max area can be 8.4*5.4 eq 45.36. largest value which is near to 45.36 is 44. Hence D. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Which of the following inequalities has a solution set, when graphed on the number line, is a single line segment of finite length? Answer Choices: (A) 2 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (B) 3 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (C) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (D) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (E) 4 <= 3x+4 <= 6\nA: Let's think step by step. The key words in the stem are:a singleline segment offinite length Now, answer choices A, B, and C can not be correct answers as solutions sets for these exponential functions are not limited at all (>= for even powers and <= for odd power) and thus can not be finite (x can go to + or -infinity for A and C and x can got to -infinity for B). As for D: we have thatabsolute valueof x is between two positive values, thus the solution set for x (because of absolute value) will be two line segments which will be mirror images of each other. Answer: A. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
