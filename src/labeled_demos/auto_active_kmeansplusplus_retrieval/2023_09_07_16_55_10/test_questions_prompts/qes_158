  "test_question": "Q: A man walks at 5 kmph for 6 hrs and at 4 kmph for 12 hrs. His average speed is Answer Choices: (A) 4 1/3 km/h (B) 7 2/3 km/h (C) 9 \u00bd km/h (D) 8 km/h (E) 81 km/h",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A train 440 meters long is running with a speed of 50 kmph. The time taken by it to cross a tunnel 180 meters long is? Answer Choices: (A) 40.33 sec (B) 41.33 sec (C) 42.33 sec (D) 40 sec (E) 44.64 sec\nA: Let's think step by step. D = 440 + 180 =620 S = 50 * 5/18 = 13.88889 mps T = 620/13.88889 = 44.64 E The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Three friends-whose walking rates are 1 ft./sec., 3ft./sec.,and 6ft./sec. start together walking in the same direction around a circular track that is 420 feet in circumference.After how many minutes are the three of them together again? Answer Choices: (A) 5 mins (B) 10 mins (C) 15 mins (D) 3 mins (E) 7 mins\nA: Let's think step by step. The time they take will be what the 1st friend takes to complete one circumference as he is the slowest and that is the point all 3 of them will be together at the end of 7 mins. E The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Five drainage pipes, each draining water from a pool at the same constant rate, together can drain a certain pool in 12 days. How many additional pipes, each draining water at the same constant rate, will be needed to drain the pool in 6 days? Answer Choices: (A)  5 (B)  9 (C)  10 (D)  12 (E)  15\nA: Let's think step by step. This is an inverse proportional problem...... 5 pipes in 12 days; So for 6 days, it will be = 12 x 5 / 6 = 10 So, 10-5 = 5 Answer A The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The sides of a rectangular region measured to the nearest centimeter are 8 cm and 5 cm. Out of the following which is the largest possible value of actual area of rectangle ? Answer Choices: (A) 48 (B) 55.25 (C) 52.29 (D) 44 (E) 41.25\nA: Let's think step by step. acan be anywhere between 7.5 and 8.4 andbcan be anywhere between 4.5 and 5.4. Hence max area can be 8.4*5.4 eq 45.36. largest value which is near to 45.36 is 44. Hence D. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
