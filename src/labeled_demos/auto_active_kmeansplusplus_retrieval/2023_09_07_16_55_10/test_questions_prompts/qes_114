  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In a certain country \u00bd of 5 = 3. Assuming the same proportion, what would be the value of 1/3 of 10 ? Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 8 (D) 7 (E) 9\nA: Let's think step by step. B 4 The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Kim finds a 2-meter tree branch and marks it off in thirds and fifths. She then breaks the branch along all the markings and removes one piece of every distinct length. What fraction of the original branch remains? Answer Choices: (A) 3/5 (B) 2/5 (C) 7/5 (D) 1/2 (E) 8/15\nA: Let's think step by step. 3 pieces of 1/5 length and two piece each of 1/15 and 2/15 lengths. removing one piece each from pieces of each kind of lengths the all that will remain will be 2 pieces of 1/5 i.e 2/5, 1 piece of 1/15, and 1 piece of 2/15 Which gives us 2/5 + 1/15 + 2/15 -----> 3/5 Answer is A The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Given a bag with 2 red balls and 3 yellow balls, you randomly select one of them, in order. If the second ball you take is yellow, what is the probability that the first one was also yellow? Answer Choices: (A) 1/2 (B) 1/5 (C) 3/4 (D) 1/3 (E) 3/5\nA: Let's think step by step. This is a conditional probability question. Basically we are told that out of 2 balls picked one is yellow and are asked to find the probability of the other one also to be yellow. So, possible options for this other ball would be: W, W, B, B (as one yellow is already picked) So the probability for that ball to be yellow too is 2/4=1/2. Option A The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A box contains five bulbs out of which 3 are defective. If four bulbs are chosen at random, find the probability that atleast one bulb is good. Answer Choices: (A) 39/10 (B) 29/10 (C) 19/10 (D) 9/10 (E) 125/128\nA: Let's think step by step. Required probability = 1 - 1/10 = 9/10 Answer: D The answer is D.\n\n\n"
