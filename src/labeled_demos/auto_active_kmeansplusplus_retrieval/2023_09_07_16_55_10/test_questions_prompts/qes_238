  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A box contains five bulbs out of which 3 are defective. If four bulbs are chosen at random, find the probability that atleast one bulb is good. Answer Choices: (A) 39/10 (B) 29/10 (C) 19/10 (D) 9/10 (E) 125/128\nA: Let's think step by step. Required probability = 1 - 1/10 = 9/10 Answer: D The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Given a bag with 2 red balls and 3 yellow balls, you randomly select one of them, in order. If the second ball you take is yellow, what is the probability that the first one was also yellow? Answer Choices: (A) 1/2 (B) 1/5 (C) 3/4 (D) 1/3 (E) 3/5\nA: Let's think step by step. This is a conditional probability question. Basically we are told that out of 2 balls picked one is yellow and are asked to find the probability of the other one also to be yellow. So, possible options for this other ball would be: W, W, B, B (as one yellow is already picked) So the probability for that ball to be yellow too is 2/4=1/2. Option A The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: How many two-element subsets of <1, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9> are there that do not contain the pair of elements 2 and 4? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 22 (C) 24 (D) 35 (E) 36\nA: Let's think step by step. 9C2 - 1 = 35 Answer is D The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Number of ways in which the letters of word PARDENS can be arranged with vowels in alphabetical order, is Answer Choices: (A) 360 (B) 240 (C) 2520 (D) 480 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Solution Order of vowels of fixed \u00e2\u02c6\u00b4 required number of ways are 7!/2!. Answer C The answer is C.\n\n\n"
