  "test_question": "Q: If x<0, y>0, and |x^3| > |y^2|, which of the following must be true? Answer Choices: (A) x > y (B) y^2 > x^2 (C) -x^3 < y^2 (D) \u2013x < y (E) x < \u2013y",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If (x^2 + 1)y=8, which of the following is not a possible value for y? Answer Choices: (A) 8/2 (B) 2/5 (C) 18/3 (D) 3 (E) 17/2\nA: Let's think step by step. Its simple equation is (x^2 +1)y = 8 ===> x^2 = (8/y) - 1 . As , in LHS, it is x^2 the value has to be positive or zero in RHS. Hence, (8/y) - 1>= 0 ===> y =< 8. Now only option E has greater value of 'y' than 8. Thus, correct ans is E The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Which of the following inequalities has a solution set, when graphed on the number line, is a single line segment of finite length? Answer Choices: (A) 2 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (B) 3 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (C) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (D) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (E) 4 <= 3x+4 <= 6\nA: Let's think step by step. The key words in the stem are:a singleline segment offinite length Now, answer choices A, B, and C can not be correct answers as solutions sets for these exponential functions are not limited at all (>= for even powers and <= for odd power) and thus can not be finite (x can go to + or -infinity for A and C and x can got to -infinity for B). As for D: we have thatabsolute valueof x is between two positive values, thus the solution set for x (because of absolute value) will be two line segments which will be mirror images of each other. Answer: A. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: y = 248 - 198x\nWhich of the following values of x gives the greatest value of y in the equation above? Answer Choices: (A)  200 (B)  100 (C)  0.5 (D)  -5 (E)  4\nA: Let's think step by step. Clearly, the negative value of x will result in maximum value of y. Don't even look at the rest of the answer choices as only one negative value is being present. Answer is D The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If x is an odd integer and y = 3x + 2, which of the following CANNOT be a divisor of y? Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 5 (C) 14 (D) 17 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. x takes odd values as 1,3,5,7., y=3x+2 x is an odd term so 3x must be an odd term when it adds with 2 so it must be a odd integer 14 didn't follows this condition ans is C The answer is C.\n\n\n"
