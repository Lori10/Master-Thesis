  "test_question": "Q: In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The average of 20 numbers is zero. Of them, at the most, how many may be greater than zero? Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 10 (D) 19 (E) None of the above\nA: Let's think step by step. Average of 20 numbers = 0. \u2234 Sum of 20 numbers = (0 \u00d7 20) = 0. It is quite possible that 19 of these numbers may be positive and if their sum is a, then 20th number is (\u2013a). Answer D The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: the government was giving out 10500 after 6 years of living in the United States and 15500 after 12 years of living in the United Sates. how much is the interest per year. Answer Choices: (A) 12% (B) 20% (C) 15% (D) 10% (E) 5%\nA: Let's think step by step. for 6 years = (15500 - 10500) = 5000. for 12 years = (5000x6)/6= 5000 Principal = (10500 - 5000) = 5500. Hence, rate = (100 x 5000)/(5500x6) % = 15% ANSWER :C The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Certain number of worms are placed in a container. The number of worms increases by three times every day and the container is completely filled with worms in 12 days. On what day, the worms were\n1/3rd of the container ? Answer Choices: (A) 9 days (B) 3 days (C) 4 days (D) 11 days (E) 14 days\nA: Let's think step by step. As every day the worms increases by 3 times 1/3 \u00d7 3 = 1 [full] Therefore on 11th day Option D The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: In a certain country \u00bd of 5 = 3. Assuming the same proportion, what would be the value of 1/3 of 10 ? Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 8 (D) 7 (E) 9\nA: Let's think step by step. B 4 The answer is B.\n\n\n"
