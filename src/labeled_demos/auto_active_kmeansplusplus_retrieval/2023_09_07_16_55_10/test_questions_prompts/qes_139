  "test_question": "Q: In the coordinate plane, a triangle has vertices at (a,0), (b,0), and (x,y). If a>x>b>0>y, which of the following represents the area of that triangle? Answer Choices: (A) (ay\u2212by) /2 (B) (ab\u2212ay) /2 (C) (by\u2212ay) /2 (D) (ay+by) /x (E) (a\u2212b) /2y",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If (x^2 + 1)y=8, which of the following is not a possible value for y? Answer Choices: (A) 8/2 (B) 2/5 (C) 18/3 (D) 3 (E) 17/2\nA: Let's think step by step. Its simple equation is (x^2 +1)y = 8 ===> x^2 = (8/y) - 1 . As , in LHS, it is x^2 the value has to be positive or zero in RHS. Hence, (8/y) - 1>= 0 ===> y =< 8. Now only option E has greater value of 'y' than 8. Thus, correct ans is E The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: If y exceeds x by 30%, then x is less than y by? Answer Choices: (A) 1/7% (B) 1/9% (C) 1/11% (D) 1/13% (E) 1/17%\nA: Let's think step by step. X=100 y=130 130------30 100-------? => 23 1/13% Answer:D The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: the perimeter of an equilateral triangle is 45.if one of the side is the side of an isoceles triangle of perimeter 40 then what is the lenght of base of isoceles triangle. Answer Choices: (A) 10 units (B) 20 units (C) 30 units (D) 40 units (E) 15 units\nA: Let's think step by step. base of isoceles triangle is 40-15-15= 10 units. ANSWER:A The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: (ab)x\u22122=(ba)x\u22127. What is the value of x ? Answer Choices: (A) 1.5 (B) 4.5 (C) 7.5 (D) 9.5 (E) 8.7\nA: Let's think step by step. Explanation: (a/b)x\u22122=(b/a)x\u22127\u21d2(a/b)x\u22122=(a/b)\u2212(x\u22127)\u21d2x\u22122=\u2212(x\u22127)\u21d2x\u22122=\u2212x+7\u21d2x\u22122=\u2212x+7\u21d22x=9\u21d2x=92=4.5 Option B The answer is B.\n\n\n"
