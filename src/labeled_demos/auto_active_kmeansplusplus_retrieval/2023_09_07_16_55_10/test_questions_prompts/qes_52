  "formatted_prompt": "Q: you need to pict any number from 1, 3,5,7,9,11,13 and 15 to make below equation true.\n()+()+()=30\ncan you solve it? Answer Choices: (A) 7+15+9 (B) 6+15+9 (C) 6+14+9 (D) 6+15+8 (E) 8+15+9\nA: Let's think step by step. Correct Answer : B 3x+15+9=30 3x =3*2*1 =6 therefore :- 6+15+9= 30 The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: The average of 20 numbers is zero. Of them, at the most, how many may be greater than zero? Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 10 (D) 19 (E) None of the above\nA: Let's think step by step. Average of 20 numbers = 0. \u2234 Sum of 20 numbers = (0 \u00d7 20) = 0. It is quite possible that 19 of these numbers may be positive and if their sum is a, then 20th number is (\u2013a). Answer D The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: y = 248 - 198x\nWhich of the following values of x gives the greatest value of y in the equation above? Answer Choices: (A)  200 (B)  100 (C)  0.5 (D)  -5 (E)  4\nA: Let's think step by step. Clearly, the negative value of x will result in maximum value of y. Don't even look at the rest of the answer choices as only one negative value is being present. Answer is D The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: (ab)x\u22122=(ba)x\u22127. What is the value of x ? Answer Choices: (A) 1.5 (B) 4.5 (C) 7.5 (D) 9.5 (E) 8.7\nA: Let's think step by step. Explanation: (a/b)x\u22122=(b/a)x\u22127\u21d2(a/b)x\u22122=(a/b)\u2212(x\u22127)\u21d2x\u22122=\u2212(x\u22127)\u21d2x\u22122=\u2212x+7\u21d2x\u22122=\u2212x+7\u21d22x=9\u21d2x=92=4.5 Option B The answer is B.\n\n\n"
