  "test_question": "Q: In a railway station, there are two trains going. One in the harbor line and one in the main line, each having a frequency of 10 minutes. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train? Answer Choices: (A) 0.9 (B) 0.8 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.65 (E) 1.5",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A train 440 meters long is running with a speed of 50 kmph. The time taken by it to cross a tunnel 180 meters long is? Answer Choices: (A) 40.33 sec (B) 41.33 sec (C) 42.33 sec (D) 40 sec (E) 44.64 sec\nA: Let's think step by step. D = 440 + 180 =620 S = 50 * 5/18 = 13.88889 mps T = 620/13.88889 = 44.64 E The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A box contains five bulbs out of which 3 are defective. If four bulbs are chosen at random, find the probability that atleast one bulb is good. Answer Choices: (A) 39/10 (B) 29/10 (C) 19/10 (D) 9/10 (E) 125/128\nA: Let's think step by step. Required probability = 1 - 1/10 = 9/10 Answer: D The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: In a certain country \u00bd of 5 = 3. Assuming the same proportion, what would be the value of 1/3 of 10 ? Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 8 (D) 7 (E) 9\nA: Let's think step by step. B 4 The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Given a bag with 2 red balls and 3 yellow balls, you randomly select one of them, in order. If the second ball you take is yellow, what is the probability that the first one was also yellow? Answer Choices: (A) 1/2 (B) 1/5 (C) 3/4 (D) 1/3 (E) 3/5\nA: Let's think step by step. This is a conditional probability question. Basically we are told that out of 2 balls picked one is yellow and are asked to find the probability of the other one also to be yellow. So, possible options for this other ball would be: W, W, B, B (as one yellow is already picked) So the probability for that ball to be yellow too is 2/4=1/2. Option A The answer is A.\n\n\n"
