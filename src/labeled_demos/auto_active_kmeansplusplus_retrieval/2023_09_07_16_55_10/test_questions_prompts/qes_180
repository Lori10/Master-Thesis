  "formatted_prompt": "Q: you need to pict any number from 1, 3,5,7,9,11,13 and 15 to make below equation true.\n()+()+()=30\ncan you solve it? Answer Choices: (A) 7+15+9 (B) 6+15+9 (C) 6+14+9 (D) 6+15+8 (E) 8+15+9\nA: Let's think step by step. Correct Answer : B 3x+15+9=30 3x =3*2*1 =6 therefore :- 6+15+9= 30 The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: The average of 20 numbers is zero. Of them, at the most, how many may be greater than zero? Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 10 (D) 19 (E) None of the above\nA: Let's think step by step. Average of 20 numbers = 0. \u2234 Sum of 20 numbers = (0 \u00d7 20) = 0. It is quite possible that 19 of these numbers may be positive and if their sum is a, then 20th number is (\u2013a). Answer D The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Which of these expressions has the greatest value? Answer Choices: (A) 1532672/1532676 (B) 1423765/1423769 (C) 1215672/1205679 (D) 1823561/1823566 (E) 1237842/1788545\nA: Let's think step by step. Using elimination method on options 1215672/1205679 = 1.00828827574... ANSWER:B The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: 108 \u00c3\u2014 108 + 92 \u00c3\u2014 92 = ? Answer Choices: (A) 20120 (B) 11500 (C) 20128 (D) 20660 (E) 20228\nA: Let's think step by step. Explanation : (a + b)2 + (a \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 b)2 = 2(a2 + b2) (Reference : Basic Algebraic Formulas) 1082 + 922 = (100 + 8)2 + (100 \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 8)2 = 2(1002 + 82) = 2(10000 + 64) = 20128. Answer : Option C The answer is C.\n\n\n"
