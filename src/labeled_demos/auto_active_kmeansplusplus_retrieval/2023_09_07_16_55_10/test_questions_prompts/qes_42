  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A train 440 meters long is running with a speed of 50 kmph. The time taken by it to cross a tunnel 180 meters long is? Answer Choices: (A) 40.33 sec (B) 41.33 sec (C) 42.33 sec (D) 40 sec (E) 44.64 sec\nA: Let's think step by step. D = 440 + 180 =620 S = 50 * 5/18 = 13.88889 mps T = 620/13.88889 = 44.64 E The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Three friends-whose walking rates are 1 ft./sec., 3ft./sec.,and 6ft./sec. start together walking in the same direction around a circular track that is 420 feet in circumference.After how many minutes are the three of them together again? Answer Choices: (A) 5 mins (B) 10 mins (C) 15 mins (D) 3 mins (E) 7 mins\nA: Let's think step by step.
