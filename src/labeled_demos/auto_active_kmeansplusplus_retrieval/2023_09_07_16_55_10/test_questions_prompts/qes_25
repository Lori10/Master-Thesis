  "test_question": "Q: If m > 0, y > 0, and x is m percent of 4y, then, in terms of y, m is what percentage of x? Answer Choices: (A) y/400 (B) 4y (C) 50y (D) 2500/y (E) 5000/y",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If y exceeds x by 30%, then x is less than y by? Answer Choices: (A) 1/7% (B) 1/9% (C) 1/11% (D) 1/13% (E) 1/17%\nA: Let's think step by step. X=100 y=130 130------30 100-------? => 23 1/13% Answer:D The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If (x^2 + 1)y=8, which of the following is not a possible value for y? Answer Choices: (A) 8/2 (B) 2/5 (C) 18/3 (D) 3 (E) 17/2\nA: Let's think step by step. Its simple equation is (x^2 +1)y = 8 ===> x^2 = (8/y) - 1 . As , in LHS, it is x^2 the value has to be positive or zero in RHS. Hence, (8/y) - 1>= 0 ===> y =< 8. Now only option E has greater value of 'y' than 8. Thus, correct ans is E The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: y = 248 - 198x\nWhich of the following values of x gives the greatest value of y in the equation above? Answer Choices: (A)  200 (B)  100 (C)  0.5 (D)  -5 (E)  4\nA: Let's think step by step. Clearly, the negative value of x will result in maximum value of y. Don't even look at the rest of the answer choices as only one negative value is being present. Answer is D The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: In a certain country \u00bd of 5 = 3. Assuming the same proportion, what would be the value of 1/3 of 10 ? Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 8 (D) 7 (E) 9\nA: Let's think step by step. B 4 The answer is B.\n\n\n"
