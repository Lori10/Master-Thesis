  "test_question": "Q: A two digit number exceeds the sum of the digits of that number by 18. If the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, what is the number? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 24 (C) 42 (D) 48 (E) 49",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: One half of a two digit number exceeds its one third by 6. What is the sum of the digits of the number? Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 5 (C) 7 (D) 9 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. x/2 \u2013 x/3 = 6 => x =6 3 + 6 = 9 ANSWER:D The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: The average of 20 numbers is zero. Of them, at the most, how many may be greater than zero? Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 10 (D) 19 (E) None of the above\nA: Let's think step by step. Average of 20 numbers = 0. \u2234 Sum of 20 numbers = (0 \u00d7 20) = 0. It is quite possible that 19 of these numbers may be positive and if their sum is a, then 20th number is (\u2013a). Answer D The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: How many two-element subsets of <1, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9> are there that do not contain the pair of elements 2 and 4? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 22 (C) 24 (D) 35 (E) 36\nA: Let's think step by step. 9C2 - 1 = 35 Answer is D The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: 108 \u00c3\u2014 108 + 92 \u00c3\u2014 92 = ? Answer Choices: (A) 20120 (B) 11500 (C) 20128 (D) 20660 (E) 20228\nA: Let's think step by step. Explanation : (a + b)2 + (a \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 b)2 = 2(a2 + b2) (Reference : Basic Algebraic Formulas) 1082 + 922 = (100 + 8)2 + (100 \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 8)2 = 2(1002 + 82) = 2(10000 + 64) = 20128. Answer : Option C The answer is C.\n\n\n"
