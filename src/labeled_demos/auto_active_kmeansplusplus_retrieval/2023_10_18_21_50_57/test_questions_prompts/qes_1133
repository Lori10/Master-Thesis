  "test_question": "Q: Anna is trying to buy books for her local library. She had a budget of $16, and she has already spent $4. She also bought 2 books today, and both books cost her the same amount of money. If Anna has $2 left in her budget, how much did each of the books cost?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: To buy a book, you pay $20 for each of the first 5 books at the supermarket, and for each additional book you buy over $20, you receive a discount of $2. If Beatrice bought 20 books, how much did she pay at the supermarket?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the first 5 books, which is simply: $20 x 5 = $100 Next, we need to calculate the cost of the remaining 15 books. Since Beatrice gets a $2 discount for each book over $20, we can calculate the cost of each book as: $20 - $2 = $18 Therefore, the cost of the remaining 15 books is: $18 x 15 = $270 Finally, we can calculate the total cost by adding the cost of the first 5 books to the cost of the remaining 15 books: $100 + $270 = $370 Therefore, Beatrice paid $370 at the supermarket for 20 books. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Whitney\u2019s mom gave her two $20 bills to spend at the school book fair. Whitney has decided to buy 2 posters, 3 notebooks, and 2 bookmarks. Each poster costs $5, each notebook costs $4, and each bookmark costs $2. How much money, in dollars, will Whitney have left over after the purchase?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of the posters. Whitney is buying 2 posters, and each poster costs $5, so the total cost of the posters is 2 x $5 = $10. Next, let's calculate the total cost of the notebooks. Whitney is buying 3 notebooks, and each notebook costs $4, so the total cost of the notebooks is 3 x $4 = $12. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the bookmarks. Whitney is buying 2 bookmarks, and each bookmark costs $2, so the total cost of the bookmarks is 2 x $2 = $4. Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Whitney is buying: $10 + $12 + $4 = $26. Whitney started with two $20 bills, which is a total of $40. After spending $26 on the posters, notebooks, and bookmarks, she will have $40 - $26 = $14 left over. Therefore, Whitney will have $14 left over after the purchase. The answer is 14.\n\n\nQ: Samuel is going to the cinema with his brother, Kevin. They both have a total budget of $20 for their outing. Samuel buys his $14 ticket, then spends $6 on drinks and food. Kevin buys his ticket, then spends $2 on drinks. They have both used their entire budget. How much did Kevin spend on food?\nA: Let's think step by step. Samuel spent $14 on his ticket and $6 on food and drinks, which means he spent a total of $20. This means that Kevin must have spent $0 on food and drinks, since they both used their entire budget of $20. Therefore, Kevin spent $6 on his ticket and $2 on drinks, which means he spent a total of $8. Since he didn't spend any money on food, the answer is $0. The answer is 0.\n\n\nQ: Anna spent 1/4 of her money, and now she has $24 left. How much did she have originally?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Anna spent 1/4 of her money. This means that she has 3/4 of her money left. Next, we know that she has $24 left. We can set up an equation to represent this: 3/4x = $24 To solve for x (the original amount of money Anna had), we can isolate x by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3: x = $24 x 4/3 x = $32 Therefore, Anna originally had $32. The answer is 32.\n\n\nQ: Oliver had $9, then he saved $5 from his allowance and spent $4 on a frisbee and $3 on a puzzle. His friend gives him another $8 as it's his birthday. How much money does Oliver have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. Oliver had $9. He saved $5 from his allowance, so he now has $9 + $5 = $14. He spent $4 on a frisbee, so he now has $14 - $4 = $10. He spent another $3 on a puzzle, so he now has $10 - $3 = $7. His friend gives him another $8, so he now has $7 + $8 = $15. Therefore, Oliver has $15 left. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: A bag of dozen apples costs $14 and Brian has already spent $10 on kiwis and half that much on bananas. What's the maximum number of apples Brian can buy if he left his house with only $50 and needs to pay the $3.50 subway fare each way?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much money Brian has left after paying for the subway fare. He needs to pay $3.50 each way, so that's a total of $7 for the round trip. Therefore, he has $50 - $7 = $43 left to spend on groceries. Next, we need to figure out how much money Brian has already spent on bananas. We know he spent half as much on bananas as he did on kiwis, and he spent $10 on kiwis. So he spent $10 / 2 = $5 on bananas. Now we can subtract the amount Brian has already spent on kiwis and bananas from the total amount he has left to spend on groceries: $43 - $10 - $5 = $28. Finally, we need to figure out how many bags of apples Brian can buy with $28. We know that one bag of apples costs $14, so we can divide $28 by $14 to get the maximum number of bags of apples Brian can buy: $28 / $14 = 2. Therefore, the maximum number of bags of apples Brian can buy is 2. Since each bag contains a dozen apples, he can buy a total of 2 x 12 = 24 apples. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Tonya is buying Christmas gifts for her sisters. She has 2 sisters and wants to spend the exact same amount on each. She buys her younger sister 4 dolls that cost $15 each. She plans to buy lego sets for her older sister. They cost $20 each. How many lego sets does she buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much Tonya spent on dolls for her younger sister. She bought 4 dolls that cost $15 each, so she spent: 4 x $15 = $60 Since Tonya wants to spend the same amount on each sister, she needs to spend $60 on lego sets for her older sister as well. Each lego set costs $20, so she needs to buy: $60 \u00f7 $20 = 3 lego sets Therefore, Tonya needs to buy 3 lego sets for her older sister. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Yanna bought ten shirts at $5 each and three pairs of sandals at $3 each.  How much change did she get back if she gave a one hundred dollar bill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of the shirts. 10 shirts x $5 per shirt = $50 Next, let's calculate the total cost of the sandals. 3 pairs of sandals x $3 per pair = $9 Now, let's add the cost of the shirts and sandals together to find the total cost. $50 + $9 = $59 Yanna gave a $100 bill, so we need to subtract the total cost from $100 to find the change. $100 - $59 = $41 Therefore, Yanna received $41 in change. The answer is 41.\n\n\n"
