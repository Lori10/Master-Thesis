  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Hansel has a created album on Spotify that contains 25 songs and each song is 3 minutes long. If she adds 10 more songs to the album with the same duration, how many minutes will it take her to finish all the songs in the album?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total duration of the original 25 songs: 25 songs x 3 minutes/song = 75 minutes Next, we need to find the total duration of the additional 10 songs: 10 songs x 3 minutes/song = 30 minutes Now, we can find the total duration of all the songs in the album: 75 minutes + 30 minutes = 105 minutes Therefore, it will take Hansel 105 minutes to finish all the songs in the album. The answer is 105.\n\n\nQ: Debra is the host of a country music radio show, and she broadcasts interviews with celebrity country music singers. Each week, she interviews three singers, one at a time.  The first interview segment is always twice as long as the other two segments combined, and the third interview segment is always half as long as the second. If the third segment is 10 minutes long, how many minutes long is the entire show?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the third interview segment is 10 minutes long and is half as long as the second segment. Therefore, the second segment is 20 minutes long (10 x 2 = 20). Next, we know that the first segment is twice as long as the other two segments combined. So, the total length of the second and third segments is 20 + 10 = 30 minutes. Therefore, the first segment is 60 minutes long (30 x 2 = 60). Finally, to find the total length of the show, we add up the lengths of all three segments: 60 + 20 + 10 = 90 minutes. Therefore, the entire show is 90 minutes long. The answer is 90.\n\n\nQ: Marla has to spend 20 minutes driving one way to her son's school, then 70 minutes attending parent-teacher night, then the same amount of time driving home. How many minutes does Marla spend on this errand in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we add the time Marla spends driving to her son's school and driving back home: 20 minutes (driving to school) + 20 minutes (driving back home) = 40 minutes Next, we add the time Marla spends at the parent-teacher night: 40 minutes (driving) + 70 minutes (parent-teacher night) = 110 minutes Therefore, Marla spends a total of 110 minutes on this errand. The answer is 110.\n\n\nQ: Mark loves to see shows in theaters. He decided to visit the theater at least once a week. One performance lasts 3 hours. The price of the ticket depends on the time spent in the theater and stands at $5 for each hour. How much will Mark spend on visits to the theater in 6 weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many performances Mark will attend in 6 weeks. Since he wants to visit the theater at least once a week, we can multiply the number of weeks by 1: 6 weeks x 1 performance per week = 6 performances Next, we need to calculate the cost of each performance. We know that one performance lasts 3 hours, so the cost of one performance will be: 3 hours x $5 per hour = $15 Finally, we can calculate the total cost of all 6 performances by multiplying the cost of one performance by the number of performances: $15 per performance x 6 performances = $90 Therefore, Mark will spend $90 on visits to the theater in 6 weeks. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: For homework, Brooke has 15 math problems, 6 social studies problems, and 10 science problems. He can answer each math problem for 2 minutes while answering each social studies problem takes him 30 seconds. If he can answer each science problem in 1.5 minutes, how long will it take Brooke to answer all his homework?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total time Brooke needs to answer all the math problems: 15 math problems x 2 minutes per problem = 30 minutes Next, let's calculate the total time Brooke needs to answer all the social studies problems: 6 social studies problems x 30 seconds per problem = 3 minutes Note that we converted the time to minutes since the time for math problems is given in minutes. Finally, let's calculate the total time Brooke needs to answer all the science problems: 10 science problems x 1.5 minutes per problem = 15 minutes Now, we can add up the time for each subject to get the total time Brooke needs to answer all his homework: 30 minutes (math) + 3 minutes (social studies) + 15 minutes (science) = 48 minutes Therefore, it will take Brooke 48 minutes to answer all his homework. The answer is 48.\n\n\nQ: James buys 3 CDs.  Two of them are 1.5 hours each.  The last one is twice that long.  What is the combined length of the CDs?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length of the third CD. We know that it is twice as long as the other two CDs, which are 1.5 hours each. So, the third CD is 1.5 x 2 = 3 hours long. Now, we can add up the lengths of all three CDs to find the combined length. Combined length = 1.5 + 1.5 + 3 Combined length = 6 hours Therefore, the combined length of the three CDs is 6 hours. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Ayen jogs for 30 minutes every day during weekdays. This week on Tuesday, she jogged 5 minutes more and also jogged 25 minutes more on Friday. How many hours, in total, did Ayen jog this week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long Ayen jogged on each weekday. She jogs for 30 minutes every day during weekdays, so from Monday to Thursday, she jogged for a total of 30 x 4 = 120 minutes. On Tuesday, she jogged 5 minutes more, so she jogged for 30 + 5 = 35 minutes. On Friday, she jogged 25 minutes more, so she jogged for 30 + 25 = 55 minutes. Therefore, Ayen jogged for a total of 120 + 35 + 55 = 210 minutes this week. To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 210 \u00f7 60 = 3.5 hours So Ayen jogged for a total of 3.5 hours this week. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Tim decides to do a movie marathon.  The first movie is 2 hours long.  The next movie is 50% longer.  And the last movie is 1 hour shorter than the combined time of the previous 2 movies.  How long was his movie marathon?\nA: Let's think step by step. First movie: 2 hours Second movie: 50% longer than the first movie = 2 + (50/100)*2 = 3 hours Total time for the first two movies: 2 + 3 = 5 hours Third movie: 1 hour shorter than the combined time of the previous two movies = 5 - 1 = 4 hours Total time for the movie marathon: 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 hours Therefore, Tim's movie marathon was 9 hours long. The answer is 9.\n\n\n"
