  "test_question": "Q: Peter wants to make different sized ice cubes with 32 ounces of water. He can make giant cubes that use 4 ounces per cube, medium cubes that use 2 ounces, and small cubes that use 1/2 an ounce. If he makes 3 giant cubes, 7 medium cubes, and 8 small cubes, how many ounces of water does he have left?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Claudia has 122 ounces of water and is filling up cups. She has 8-ounce glasses, 5-ounce glasses, and 4-ounce glasses. If she fills six 5 ounce glasses and four 8 ounce glasses, how many 4 ounce glasses can she fill with the remaining water?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much water Claudia has used so far. 6 x 5 = 30 ounces (for six 5-ounce glasses) 4 x 8 = 32 ounces (for four 8-ounce glasses) So, Claudia has used 30 + 32 = 62 ounces of water. Now, let's calculate how much water she has left. 122 - 62 = 60 ounces Finally, let's calculate how many 4-ounce glasses she can fill with the remaining water. 60 / 4 = 15 Therefore, Claudia can fill 15 4-ounce glasses with the remaining water. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Tim drinks 2 bottles that are each 1.5 quarts and an additional 20 ounces a day.  How much water does he drink a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the 1.5 quarts to ounces. 1 quart = 32 ounces So, 1.5 quarts = 1.5 x 32 = 48 ounces Tim drinks 2 bottles, so he drinks 2 x 48 = 96 ounces from the bottles. He also drinks an additional 20 ounces a day, so he drinks a total of 96 + 20 = 116 ounces a day. To find out how much he drinks in a week, we need to multiply 116 by 7 (the number of days in a week). 116 x 7 = 812 Therefore, Tim drinks 812 ounces of water in a week. The answer is 812.\n\n\nQ: Timmy, Tommy and Tina are filling up a kiddie pool in their backyard.  Each has a pail they fill with water from a house before dumping it into the pool.  If Timmy's pail holds twice as much water as Tommy's, and Tommy's holds 2 gallons more than Tina's, and Tina's is 4 gallons, how much water do the three of them fill the pool with after 3 trips each?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much water each pail can hold. We know that Tina's pail holds 4 gallons. Tommy's pail holds 2 more gallons than Tina's, so it holds 4 + 2 = 6 gallons. Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's, so it holds 6 x 2 = 12 gallons. Now we know how much water each pail can hold, we can figure out how much water they can fill the pool with after 1 trip each. Together, they can fill the pool with 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 gallons of water. After 3 trips each, they will have filled the pool with 22 x 3 = 66 gallons of water. The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: Jack makes his own cold brew coffee.  He makes it in batches of 1.5 gallons.  He drinks 96 ounces of coffee every 2 days.  It takes 20 hours to make coffee.  How long does he spend making coffee over 24 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 1.5 gallons to ounces. There are 128 ounces in a gallon, so 1.5 gallons is 1.5 x 128 = 192 ounces. Next, we need to figure out how many ounces of coffee Jack makes in one batch. Since he makes 192 ounces of cold brew coffee in one batch, that's how much he has to drink over the course of 2 days. Therefore, he drinks 192/2 = 96 ounces of coffee every 2 days. Now we need to figure out how many batches of coffee Jack needs to make over 24 days. Since he drinks 96 ounces of coffee every 2 days, he drinks 96 x 12 = 1152 ounces of coffee over 24 days. Since each batch of coffee is 192 ounces, Jack needs to make 1152/192 = 6 batches of coffee over 24 days. Finally, we need to figure out how long it takes Jack to make 6 batches of coffee. Since it takes 20 hours to make one batch of coffee, it takes 20 x 6 = 120 hours to make 6 batches of coffee. Therefore, Jack spends 120 hours making coffee over 24 days. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Chad is hosting a BBQ on the hottest day of the year, where there will be a total of 15 people.  He will need 2 pounds of ice per person to account for the heat.  One pound bags of ice are sold for $3.00 for a pack of 10.  How much will he spend on ice?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pounds of ice Chad will need in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of people by the amount of ice needed per person: 15 people x 2 pounds/person = 30 pounds of ice Next, we need to figure out how many packs of ice Chad will need to buy. Since each pack contains 10 one-pound bags of ice, we can divide the total pounds needed by 10: 30 pounds of ice \u00f7 10 bags/pack = 3 packs of ice Finally, we can calculate the total cost of the ice by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack: 3 packs x $3.00/pack = $9.00 Therefore, Chad will spend $9.00 on ice for his BBQ. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Marie, the confectioner, makes 12 chocolate eggs, each weighing 10 ounces. She then packs an equal number of the eggs in 4 different gift boxes. Unfortunately, she leaves one of the boxes by the kitchen window and the afternoon sun melts everything. She tosses that box out. What is the total weight, in ounces, of the remaining chocolate eggs?\nA: Let's think step by step. Marie makes 12 chocolate eggs, each weighing 10 ounces. So the total weight of all the eggs is: 12 x 10 = 120 ounces Marie packs an equal number of eggs in 4 different gift boxes. So each box contains: 120 / 4 = 30 ounces But one of the boxes is tossed out, so we need to subtract the weight of that box from the total weight of the eggs. Therefore, the total weight of the remaining chocolate eggs is: (3 boxes) x (30 ounces per box) = 90 ounces The answer is 90.\n\n\nQ: When it rains, the three holes in the garage roof leak water at different rates.  The largest hole leaks at a rate of 3 ounces of water  per minute.  The medium-sized hole leaks water at one-half the rate of the largest hole.  And the smallest hole leaks water at a rate of one-third the rate of the medium-sized hole.  When it rains, what is the combined amount of water, in ounces, that leak from all three holes over a 2-hour time period?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the rate at which the medium-sized hole leaks water. We know that it leaks at one-half the rate of the largest hole, which is 3 ounces per minute. So, the medium-sized hole leaks at a rate of 3/2 = 1.5 ounces per minute. Next, we need to find the rate at which the smallest hole leaks water. We know that it leaks at a rate of one-third the rate of the medium-sized hole, which is 1.5/3 = 0.5 ounces per minute. Now, we can find the total amount of water that leaks from all three holes in one minute. We add up the rates of all three holes: 3 + 1.5 + 0.5 = 5 ounces per minute. Finally, we can find the total amount of water that leaks from all three holes over a 2-hour time period (which is 120 minutes). We multiply the total rate by the time: 5 x 120 = 600 ounces. Therefore, the combined amount of water that leaks from all three holes over a 2-hour time period is 600 ounces. The answer is 600.\n\n\nQ: Twenty gallons of tea were poured into 80 containers. Geraldo drank 3.5 containers. How many pints of tea did Geraldo drink?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many gallons of tea Geraldo drank. We know that he drank 3.5 containers, and each container holds 1/4 gallon of tea (since 20 gallons were poured into 80 containers). So, Geraldo drank: 3.5 containers x 1/4 gallon per container = 7/8 gallon of tea Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so: 7/8 gallon x 8 pints per gallon = 7 pints Therefore, Geraldo drank 7 pints of tea. The answer is 7.\n\n\n"
