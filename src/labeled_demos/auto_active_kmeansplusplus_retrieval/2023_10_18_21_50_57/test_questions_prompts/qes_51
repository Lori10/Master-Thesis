  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Six more than twice as many ducks go to North Pond as go to Lake Michigan. If Lake Michigan has 100 ducks, how many ducks can you safely estimate there will be at North Pond?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many ducks go to North Pond. We know that \"Six more than twice as many ducks go to North Pond as go to Lake Michigan.\" So, we can start by finding twice as many ducks as Lake Michigan: 2 x 100 = 200 Now, we add six to that: 200 + 6 = 206 Therefore, we can safely estimate that there will be 206 ducks at North Pond. The answer is 206.\n\n\nQ: Cornelia likes to travel. She visited already 42 different countries. 20 of them were in Europe and 10 in South America. From the rest of the countries, only half of them were in Asia. How many Asian countries has Cornelia visited?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Cornelia visited a total of 42 countries. Out of those 42 countries, 20 were in Europe and 10 were in South America. So, the number of countries Cornelia visited outside of Europe and South America is: 42 - 20 - 10 = 12 Now we know that half of the remaining countries were in Asia. So, the number of Asian countries Cornelia visited is: 12 / 2 = 6 Therefore, Cornelia visited 6 Asian countries. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: John has 10 members of his family on his father's side.  His mother's side is 30% larger.  How many people are there in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to find out how many people are on John's mother's side. We know that it is 30% larger than his father's side, so we can calculate: 30% of 10 = 0.3 x 10 = 3 This means that John has 3 more family members on his mother's side than on his father's side. So, the total number of family members on his mother's side is: 10 + 3 = 13 Now, we can add up the number of family members on both sides to find the total: 10 + 13 = 23 Therefore, there are 23 people in John's family in total. The answer is 23.\n\n\nQ: Betty has 20 books, and her sister has 1/4 times more books than Betty. What's the total number of books the two have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many books Betty's sister has. To do this, we can take 1/4 of Betty's number of books and add it to Betty's number of books. 1/4 of 20 books is (1/4) x 20 = 5 books. So Betty's sister has 20 + 5 = 25 books. To find the total number of books the two have, we can add Betty's number of books to her sister's number of books: 20 + 25 = 45 books. Therefore, the two sisters have a total of 45 books. The answer is 45.\n\n\nQ: Los Angeles has 6 million people living in it. If half the population is women and 1/3 of the women work in retail, how many women work in retail in Los Angeles?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of women in Los Angeles. Half of the population is women, so we can calculate: 6 million / 2 = 3 million women Step 2: Find the number of women who work in retail. One-third of the women work in retail, so we can calculate: 3 million / 3 = 1 million women work in retail Therefore, there are 1 million women who work in retail in Los Angeles. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Ivan has 20 dice. Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. How many dice do they have altogether?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Ivan has 20 dice. Next, we know that Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. So, we can multiply Ivan's number of dice by 2 to find Jerry's number of dice: 20 x 2 = 40 Therefore, Jerry has 40 dice. To find the total number of dice they have altogether, we can add Ivan's and Jerry's number of dice: 20 + 40 = 60 Therefore, they have 60 dice altogether. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Two old ladies spent the afternoon walking through Central Park.  The first lady walked twice as far as the second lady.  If the second lady walked four miles, what is the combined total distance, in miles, the two ladies walked?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the second lady walked 4 miles. Next, we know that the first lady walked twice as far as the second lady. So, we can multiply the second lady's distance by 2 to find the first lady's distance: 4 miles x 2 = 8 miles Therefore, the combined total distance the two ladies walked is: 4 miles + 8 miles = 12 miles The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: A zoo has 8 parrots. It 3 times the number of snakes than parrots and 2 times the number of monkeys than snakes. The number of elephants is half the number of parrots and snakes added up, and there are 3 fewer zebras than elephants. What is the difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the zoo has 8 parrots. Next, we are told that there are 3 times as many snakes as parrots. So, the number of snakes would be 3 x 8 = 24. Then, we are told that there are 2 times as many monkeys as snakes. So, the number of monkeys would be 2 x 24 = 48. The number of elephants is half the number of parrots and snakes added up. So, the number of elephants would be (8 + 24) / 2 = 16. Finally, we are told that there are 3 fewer zebras than elephants. So, the number of zebras would be 16 - 3 = 13. The difference between the number of zebras and monkeys would be 48 - 13 = 35. Therefore, the difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys is 35. The answer is 35.\n\n\n"
