  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Madeline wants to plant 20 flowers in her garden. She assumes that about half of the seeds she plants will die before they bloom. However, the flower shop only sells packs of seeds with 25 seeds per pack. Each pack is $5. How much will Madeline spend on seeds to plant 20 flowers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many seeds Madeline needs to plant 20 flowers. Since she assumes that about half of the seeds will die, she needs to plant twice as many seeds as the number of flowers she wants. Therefore, she needs to plant 20 x 2 = 40 seeds. Next, we need to figure out how many packs of seeds Madeline needs to buy. Since each pack contains 25 seeds, she needs to buy 40 / 25 = 1.6 packs of seeds. Since she can't buy a fraction of a pack, she needs to round up to the nearest whole pack. Therefore, she needs to buy 2 packs of seeds. Finally, we need to figure out how much Madeline will spend on seeds. Since each pack costs $5 and she needs to buy 2 packs, she will spend 5 x 2 = $10 on seeds. Therefore, Madeline will spend $10 on seeds to plant 20 flowers. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Maria's birthday is in 22 days. Her friend Lilly wants to buy her flowers so she saves $2 each day until Maria's birthday. If a flower costs $4, how many flowers can she buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Lilly will have saved up by Maria's birthday. Lilly saves $2 each day for 22 days, so she will have saved: $2/day x 22 days = $44 Now we need to figure out how many flowers Lilly can buy with $44. Each flower costs $4, so we can divide the total amount of money Lilly has saved by the cost of each flower: $44 \u00f7 $4/flower = 11 flowers Therefore, Lilly can buy 11 flowers for Maria's birthday. The answer is 11.\n\n\nQ: Since 1989, Lily has treated herself to 1 hydrangea plant, each year.  Each plant costs $20.00.  By 2021, how much money has Lily spent on hydrangeas?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many years it has been since 1989 to 2021. 2021 - 1989 = 32 years So, Lily has been treating herself to 1 hydrangea plant every year for 32 years. Next, we need to find out how much money Lily has spent on hydrangeas. 1 plant costs $20.00, so: 32 years x $20.00 per plant = $640.00 Therefore, Lily has spent $640.00 on hydrangeas since 1989. The answer is 1989.\n\n\nQ: Jezebel needs to buy two dozens of red roses and 3 pieces of sunflowers for a bouquet that she is going to arrange. Each red rose costs $1.50 and each sunflower costs $3. How much will Jezebel pay for all those flowers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine how many flowers Jezebel needs to buy. Two dozens of red roses mean 2 x 12 = 24 red roses. She also needs 3 sunflowers. So, in total, she needs 24 + 3 = 27 flowers. Next, we need to calculate the cost of the red roses. Each red rose costs $1.50, so 24 red roses will cost 24 x $1.50 = $36. Then, we need to calculate the cost of the sunflowers. Each sunflower costs $3, so 3 sunflowers will cost 3 x $3 = $9. Finally, we add the cost of the red roses and the sunflowers to get the total cost. $36 + $9 = $45. Therefore, Jezebel will pay $45 for all those flowers. The answer is 45.\n\n\nQ: Dane\u2019s two daughters need to plant 5 flowers each to grow a garden. As the days passed, the flowers grew into 20 more but 10 of them died. Dane\u2019s daughters harvested the flowers and split them between 5 different baskets. How many flowers ended up in each basket?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many flowers were in the garden before the 20 grew and 10 died. Dane's two daughters planted 5 flowers each, so they planted a total of 2 x 5 = 10 flowers. After the flowers grew, there were 10 + 20 = 30 flowers in the garden. But then 10 of them died, so there were 30 - 10 = 20 flowers left. Finally, the 20 flowers were split between 5 baskets, so each basket had 20 / 5 = 4 flowers. Therefore, each basket ended up with 4 flowers. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: James and 4 of his friends volunteered to plant flowers. In 2 days, they were able to plant a total of 200 flowers. If each of them planted the same number of flowers, how many flowers did James plant in a day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people were planting flowers. We know that James and 4 of his friends volunteered, so there were 5 people in total. Next, we need to find out how many flowers each person planted in 2 days. To do this, we can divide the total number of flowers planted (200) by the number of people (5) and the number of days (2): 200 \u00f7 5 \u00f7 2 = 20 So each person planted 20 flowers in 2 days. Finally, we need to find out how many flowers James planted in 1 day. Since each person planted 20 flowers in 2 days, we can divide that by 2 to find out how many flowers each person planted in 1 day: 20 \u00f7 2 = 10 Therefore, James planted 10 flowers in 1 day. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Fran\u00e7oise sells pots of lily of the valley to fund humanitarian work. She buys them at \u20ac12 each and sells them at a 25% higher cost. How much will she give back to the association by selling 150 pots of lily of the valley?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the selling price of each pot of lily of the valley. Fran\u00e7oise sells them at a 25% higher cost than the buying price of \u20ac12, so we need to add 25% of \u20ac12 to \u20ac12: 25% of \u20ac12 = 0.25 x \u20ac12 = \u20ac3 Selling price = \u20ac12 + \u20ac3 = \u20ac15 Now we know that Fran\u00e7oise sells each pot of lily of the valley for \u20ac15. To calculate how much she will give back to the association by selling 150 pots, we need to multiply the selling price by the number of pots sold: \u20ac15 x 150 = \u20ac2250 Therefore, Fran\u00e7oise will give back \u20ac2250 to the association by selling 150 pots of lily of the valley. The answer is 150.\n\n\nQ: A flower shop sells bouquets of roses, which each contain 12 roses, and bouquets of daisies, which each contain an equal amount of daisies. The flower shop sells 20 bouquets today. 10 of these were rose bouquets and the remaining 10 bouquets were daisy bouquets. If the flower shop has sold 190 flowers in total today, how many daisies are in each bouquet of daisies?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the flower shop sold 10 bouquets of roses, each containing 12 roses, so they sold a total of 10 x 12 = 120 roses. Next, we know that the flower shop sold 10 bouquets of daisies, and we want to find out how many daisies are in each bouquet. Let's call the number of daisies in each bouquet \"d\". So, the flower shop sold a total of 10 x d = 10d daisies. We also know that the flower shop sold a total of 190 flowers in total today, so: 120 (roses) + 10d (daisies) = 190 Simplifying this equation, we get: 10d = 70 Dividing both sides by 10, we get: d = 7 Therefore, each bouquet of daisies contains 7 daisies. The answer is 7.\n\n\n"
