  "formatted_prompt": "Q: James paints a 20 ft by 15 ft mural.  It takes him 20 minutes to paint 1 square foot and he charges $150 per hour.  How much does he charge to paint the mural?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total area of the mural. We can do this by multiplying the length and width: 20 ft x 15 ft = 300 sq ft Next, we need to find how long it takes James to paint the entire mural. Since he can paint 1 sq ft in 20 minutes, he can paint 300 sq ft in: 300 sq ft x 20 minutes/sq ft = 6000 minutes Now we need to convert the time to hours, since James charges by the hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so: 6000 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes/hour = 100 hours Finally, we can calculate how much James charges for the job by multiplying the number of hours by his hourly rate: 100 hours x $150/hour = $15,000 Therefore, James charges $15,000 to paint the mural. The answer is 15000.\n\n\nQ: Maria wants to paint a picture and needs some tools to do that. She wants to buy a set of brushes for $20 and some canvas for three times more than the brushes. The paint costs Maria $8 per liter, and she needs at least 5 liters. How much money will she earn on the painting if she will be able to sell it for $200?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much Maria will spend on canvas. We know that the canvas will cost three times more than the brushes, which are $20. So, 3 x $20 = $60 for the canvas. Next, let's calculate how much Maria will spend on paint. She needs at least 5 liters, and each liter costs $8. So, 5 x $8 = $40 for the paint. Now, let's add up all of Maria's expenses: $20 for brushes + $60 for canvas + $40 for paint = $120 total expenses. If Maria sells the painting for $200, she will earn $200 - $120 = $80 profit. The answer is 80.\n\n\nQ: Andy is mixing blue, green and white paint in a 1 : 2 : 5 ratio. If he uses 6 gallons of green paint, how many gallons of paint does he use total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much paint Andy is using in total based on the ratio given. The ratio of blue : green : white paint is 1 : 2 : 5. This means that for every 1 gallon of blue paint, Andy uses 2 gallons of green paint and 5 gallons of white paint. Since we know that Andy is using 6 gallons of green paint, we can use this information to find out how much of the other colors he is using. 2 gallons of green paint is equivalent to 1 gallon of blue paint, so Andy is using 3 gallons of blue paint (since 6/2 = 3). 5 gallons of white paint is equivalent to 2.5 gallons of green paint, so Andy is using 30 gallons of white paint (since 6 x 5 = 30). Therefore, Andy is using a total of 6 + 3 + 30 = 39 gallons of paint. The answer is 39.\n\n\nQ: Mark is buying asphalt to pave a new section of road. The road will be 2000 feet long and 20 feet wide. Each truckload of asphalt will cover 800 square feet of road. If each truckload costs $75, and there's a 20% sales tax, how much will Mark need to pay for asphalt?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total area of the road that needs to be paved. We can do this by multiplying the length and width of the road: 2000 feet x 20 feet = 40,000 square feet Next, we need to figure out how many truckloads of asphalt Mark will need. We can do this by dividing the total area of the road by the area covered by each truckload: 40,000 square feet \u00f7 800 square feet/truckload = 50 truckloads Now we can calculate the cost of the asphalt. Each truckload costs $75, so 50 truckloads will cost: 50 truckloads x $75/truckload = $3750 Finally, we need to add the sales tax. The sales tax is 20% of the cost of the asphalt: $3750 x 0.20 = $750 So the total cost of the asphalt, including sales tax, is: $3750 + $750 = $4500 Therefore, Mark will need to pay $4500 for the asphalt. The answer is 4500.\n\n\nQ: Don can paint 3 tiles a minute, Ken can paint 2 more tiles a minute than Don and Laura can paint twice as many tiles as Ken. Kim can paint 3 fewer tiles than Laura can in a minute. How many tiles can Don, Ken, Laura and Kim paint in 15 minutes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many tiles each person can paint in one minute. Don can paint 3 tiles a minute. Ken can paint 2 more tiles a minute than Don, so Ken can paint 3 + 2 = 5 tiles a minute. Laura can paint twice as many tiles as Ken, so Laura can paint 5 x 2 = 10 tiles a minute. Kim can paint 3 fewer tiles than Laura can in a minute, so Kim can paint 10 - 3 = 7 tiles a minute. Now that we know how many tiles each person can paint in one minute, we can multiply that by 15 to find out how many tiles they can paint in 15 minutes. Don can paint 3 x 15 = 45 tiles in 15 minutes. Ken can paint 5 x 15 = 75 tiles in 15 minutes. Laura can paint 10 x 15 = 150 tiles in 15 minutes. Kim can paint 7 x 15 = 105 tiles in 15 minutes. Therefore, Don can paint 45 tiles, Ken can paint 75 tiles, Laura can paint 150 tiles, and Kim can paint 105 tiles in 15 minutes. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: There are four lamps in Valerie's room. All of them are burnt out, so she needs to buy new light bulbs. She needs 3 small light bulbs and 1 large light bulb. She has $60 to spend. If small light bulbs cost $8 and large light bulbs cost $12, how much money will Valerie have left over?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total cost of the light bulbs Valerie needs to buy. The cost of 3 small light bulbs is: 3 x $8 = $24 The cost of 1 large light bulb is: 1 x $12 = $12 So the total cost is: $24 + $12 = $36 Next, we need to subtract the total cost from the amount of money Valerie has: $60 - $36 = $24 Therefore, Valerie will have $24 left over after buying the light bulbs. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Yvette wants to frame a new picture. When she goes to her local frame shop, she finds out that the frame she wanted is 20% more expensive than her budget of $60. If she paid for a smaller frame at 3/4 the new price of the frame she initially intended to buy, how much money did she remain with?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out the price of the frame Yvette initially intended to buy. We know that it is 20% more expensive than her budget of $60, so we can set up an equation: Price of initial frame = $60 + 20% of $60 Price of initial frame = $60 + $12 Price of initial frame = $72 Next, we need to find out the price of the smaller frame that Yvette ended up buying. We know that it is 3/4 the price of the initial frame, so we can set up another equation: Price of smaller frame = 3/4 x $72 Price of smaller frame = $54 Finally, we need to find out how much money Yvette remained with. We know that she initially had a budget of $60, but she ended up spending $54 on the smaller frame. So we can subtract the price of the smaller frame from her budget: Money Yvette remained with = $60 - $54 Money Yvette remained with = $6 Therefore, Yvette remained with $6 after buying the smaller frame. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Maddie bought 2 packs of white T-shirts and 4 packs of blue T-shirts for her basketball team. The white T-shirts come in packs of 5, and the blue T-shirts come in packs of 3. Each T-shirt cost $3. How much did Maddie spend in all?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many white T-shirts Maddie bought. She bought 2 packs of white T-shirts, and each pack contains 5 T-shirts. So, she bought a total of 2 x 5 = 10 white T-shirts. Next, we need to find out how many blue T-shirts Maddie bought. She bought 4 packs of blue T-shirts, and each pack contains 3 T-shirts. So, she bought a total of 4 x 3 = 12 blue T-shirts. Now, we can find out how much Maddie spent on white T-shirts. She bought 10 white T-shirts, and each T-shirt cost $3. So, she spent 10 x $3 = $30 on white T-shirts. Similarly, we can find out how much Maddie spent on blue T-shirts. She bought 12 blue T-shirts, and each T-shirt cost $3. So, she spent 12 x $3 = $36 on blue T-shirts. Finally, we can add the amount Maddie spent on white T-shirts and blue T-shirts to find out how much she spent in all. Maddie spent $30 on white T-shirts and $36 on blue T-shirts, so she spent a total of $30 + $36 = $66 in all. The answer is 66.\n\n\n"
