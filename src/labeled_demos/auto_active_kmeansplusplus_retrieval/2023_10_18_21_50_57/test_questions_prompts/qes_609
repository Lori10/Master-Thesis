  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Madeline wants to plant 20 flowers in her garden. She assumes that about half of the seeds she plants will die before they bloom. However, the flower shop only sells packs of seeds with 25 seeds per pack. Each pack is $5. How much will Madeline spend on seeds to plant 20 flowers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many seeds Madeline needs to plant 20 flowers. Since she assumes that about half of the seeds will die, she needs to plant twice as many seeds as the number of flowers she wants. Therefore, she needs to plant 20 x 2 = 40 seeds. Next, we need to figure out how many packs of seeds Madeline needs to buy. Since each pack contains 25 seeds, she needs to buy 40 / 25 = 1.6 packs of seeds. Since she can't buy a fraction of a pack, she needs to round up to the nearest whole pack. Therefore, she needs to buy 2 packs of seeds. Finally, we need to figure out how much Madeline will spend on seeds. Since each pack costs $5 and she needs to buy 2 packs, she will spend 5 x 2 = $10 on seeds. Therefore, Madeline will spend $10 on seeds to plant 20 flowers. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: A tomato plant has 100 tomatoes. Jane picks 1/4 of that number for use in their house. After a week, she goes back and picks 20 more tomatoes, and the following week picks twice that number. What's the total number of fruits remaining on the tomato plant?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Jane picks 1/4 of 100 tomatoes, which is 25 tomatoes. So, there are 100 - 25 = 75 tomatoes left on the plant. After a week, Jane picks 20 more tomatoes, so there are 75 - 20 = 55 tomatoes left on the plant. The following week, Jane picks twice the number of tomatoes she picked the previous week, which is 2 * 20 = 40 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes Jane picked is 25 + 20 + 40 = 85 tomatoes. The total number of tomatoes remaining on the plant is 100 - 85 = 15 tomatoes. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Dane\u2019s two daughters need to plant 5 flowers each to grow a garden. As the days passed, the flowers grew into 20 more but 10 of them died. Dane\u2019s daughters harvested the flowers and split them between 5 different baskets. How many flowers ended up in each basket?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many flowers were in the garden before the 20 grew and 10 died. Dane's two daughters planted 5 flowers each, so they planted a total of 2 x 5 = 10 flowers. After the flowers grew, there were 10 + 20 = 30 flowers in the garden. But then 10 of them died, so there were 30 - 10 = 20 flowers left. Finally, the 20 flowers were split between 5 baskets, so each basket had 20 / 5 = 4 flowers. Therefore, each basket ended up with 4 flowers. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: James has a small tree outside his window with 30 branches with 90 twigs per branch. 30% of the twigs sprout 4 leaves and the rest sprout 5 leaves. How many leaves are on the tree total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of twigs on the tree. We know that there are 30 branches with 90 twigs per branch, so: 30 branches x 90 twigs per branch = 2700 twigs Next, we need to find how many twigs sprout 4 leaves and how many sprout 5 leaves. We know that 30% of the twigs sprout 4 leaves, so: 30% of 2700 twigs = 0.3 x 2700 = 810 twigs sprout 4 leaves The remaining twigs sprout 5 leaves: 2700 twigs - 810 twigs = 1890 twigs sprout 5 leaves Now we can find the total number of leaves on the tree. Each twig that sprouts 4 leaves contributes 4 leaves, and each twig that sprouts 5 leaves contributes 5 leaves. So: 810 twigs x 4 leaves per twig = 3240 leaves from twigs that sprout 4 leaves 1890 twigs x 5 leaves per twig = 9450 leaves from twigs that sprout 5 leaves The total number of leaves on the tree is: 3240 leaves + 9450 leaves = 12690 leaves Therefore, there are 12690 leaves on the tree in total. The answer is 12690.\n\n\nQ: James and 4 of his friends volunteered to plant flowers. In 2 days, they were able to plant a total of 200 flowers. If each of them planted the same number of flowers, how many flowers did James plant in a day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people were planting flowers. We know that James and 4 of his friends volunteered, so there were 5 people in total. Next, we need to find out how many flowers each person planted in 2 days. To do this, we can divide the total number of flowers planted (200) by the number of people (5) and the number of days (2): 200 \u00f7 5 \u00f7 2 = 20 So each person planted 20 flowers in 2 days. Finally, we need to find out how many flowers James planted in 1 day. Since each person planted 20 flowers in 2 days, we can divide that by 2 to find out how many flowers each person planted in 1 day: 20 \u00f7 2 = 10 Therefore, James planted 10 flowers in 1 day. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Jezebel needs to buy two dozens of red roses and 3 pieces of sunflowers for a bouquet that she is going to arrange. Each red rose costs $1.50 and each sunflower costs $3. How much will Jezebel pay for all those flowers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine how many flowers Jezebel needs to buy. Two dozens of red roses mean 2 x 12 = 24 red roses. She also needs 3 sunflowers. So, in total, she needs 24 + 3 = 27 flowers. Next, we need to calculate the cost of the red roses. Each red rose costs $1.50, so 24 red roses will cost 24 x $1.50 = $36. Then, we need to calculate the cost of the sunflowers. Each sunflower costs $3, so 3 sunflowers will cost 3 x $3 = $9. Finally, we add the cost of the red roses and the sunflowers to get the total cost. $36 + $9 = $45. Therefore, Jezebel will pay $45 for all those flowers. The answer is 45.\n\n\nQ: There are 10 bags with 30 oranges each on a truck. A total of 50 pieces of oranges are rotten. Thirty pieces of oranges will be kept for making orange juice and the rest will be sold. How many pieces of oranges will be sold?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of oranges in the 10 bags. 10 bags x 30 oranges/bag = 300 oranges Next, we need to subtract the number of rotten oranges. 300 oranges - 50 rotten oranges = 250 good oranges Now, we know that 30 oranges will be kept for making juice. 250 good oranges - 30 oranges for juice = 220 oranges to be sold Therefore, 220 pieces of oranges will be sold. The answer is 220.\n\n\nQ: An apple tree produces 40 apples in its first year.  The second year the apple tree produces 8 more than double the amount of apples that it produced the first year, and the third year production went down by a fourth due to an insect infestation.  How many apples did the tree produce in total in the first three years?\nA: Let's think step by step. First year: 40 apples Second year: 8 more than double the amount of apples produced in the first year Double the amount of apples produced in the first year: 40 x 2 = 80 apples 8 more than double the amount of apples produced in the first year: 80 + 8 = 88 apples Third year: production went down by a fourth due to an insect infestation One fourth of the second year's production: 88 / 4 = 22 apples Third year's production: 88 - 22 = 66 apples Total production in the first three years: 40 + 88 + 66 = 194 apples. Therefore, the apple tree produced 194 apples in total in the first three years. The answer is 194.\n\n\n"
