  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Jamie and Oliver are planning to go on a vacation. A plane ticket costs $24 for each person and a hotel stay costs $12 for each person per day. How much money will they spend on the vacation if they stay for 3 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets for both Jamie and Oliver. Since each ticket costs $24, the total cost of the tickets will be: $24 x 2 = $48 Next, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel stay. Since the cost is $12 per person per day, and they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel stay will be: $12 x 2 x 3 = $72 Finally, we need to add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay to get the total cost of the vacation: $48 + $72 = $120 Therefore, Jamie and Oliver will spend $120 on their vacation. The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: Ayla has a customer care job whose primary role is to hear complaints from customers and advise them on the best way to solve their problems. She talks with each customer for a limited amount of time, and each phone call is charged five cents per minute. If each call lasts 1 hour, what's the phone bill at the end of the month if she manages to talk to 50 customers a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many minutes are in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, each call lasts 60 minutes. Next, we need to find out how many minutes Ayla spends on the phone each week. If she talks to 50 customers a week, and each call lasts 60 minutes, then she spends 50 x 60 = 3000 minutes on the phone each week. Now we can calculate the cost of the phone bill. Each minute costs five cents, so 3000 minutes will cost 3000 x $0.05 = $150. Therefore, the phone bill at the end of the month will be $150 x 4 = $600 if Ayla manages to talk to 50 customers a week. The answer is 50.\n\n\nQ: Rachel makes $12.00 as a waitress in a coffee shop.  In one hour, she serves 20 different people and they all leave her a $1.25 tip.  How much money did she make in that hour?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how much money Rachel made from her hourly wage. Rachel makes $12.00 as a waitress in a coffee shop. Next, we need to calculate how much money Rachel made from tips. In one hour, she serves 20 different people and they all leave her a $1.25 tip. To calculate the tip money, we can multiply the number of people Rachel served by the amount of tip each person left her: 20 people x $1.25 tip = $25.00 Now, we can add the tip money to Rachel's hourly wage to find out how much money she made in that hour: $12.00 hourly wage + $25.00 tip money = $37.00 Therefore, Rachel made $37.00 in that hour. The answer is 37.\n\n\nQ: A department store offers a 10% discount for the amount exceeding $100 of the customer's total charge. Jaco bought a pair of shoes for $74; 2 pairs of socks that cost $2 per pair; a bag that costs $42. How much will Jaco pay for those items?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jaco bought: - Shoes: $74 - Socks: 2 pairs x $2 per pair = $4 - Bag: $42 Total cost = $74 + $4 + $42 = $120 Since the total cost exceeds $100, Jaco is eligible for a discount. The amount that exceeds $100 is $20 ($120 - $100). The discount is 10% of $20, which is $2. Therefore, Jaco will pay the total cost minus the discount: Total cost - discount = $120 - $2 = $118 Jaco will pay $118 for those items. The answer is 118.\n\n\nQ: Mark loves to see shows in theaters. He decided to visit the theater at least once a week. One performance lasts 3 hours. The price of the ticket depends on the time spent in the theater and stands at $5 for each hour. How much will Mark spend on visits to the theater in 6 weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many performances Mark will attend in 6 weeks. Since he wants to visit the theater at least once a week, we can multiply the number of weeks by 1: 6 weeks x 1 performance per week = 6 performances Next, we need to calculate the cost of each performance. We know that one performance lasts 3 hours, so the cost of one performance will be: 3 hours x $5 per hour = $15 Finally, we can calculate the total cost of all 6 performances by multiplying the cost of one performance by the number of performances: $15 per performance x 6 performances = $90 Therefore, Mark will spend $90 on visits to the theater in 6 weeks. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Twenty people pre-bought plane tickets at a price of $155 per ticket. Thirty people bought their plane tickets at the gate and they each paid $200 for their ticket. How many more dollars did the people at the gate pay for their tickets than those passengers that pre-bought their tickets?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total cost of pre-bought tickets Twenty people pre-bought tickets at $155 per ticket, so the total cost is: 20 x $155 = $3100 Step 2: Find the total cost of tickets bought at the gate Thirty people bought tickets at $200 per ticket, so the total cost is: 30 x $200 = $6000 Step 3: Find the difference in cost between the two groups To find the difference, we subtract the total cost of pre-bought tickets from the total cost of tickets bought at the gate: $6000 - $3100 = $2900 Therefore, the people at the gate paid $2900 more for their tickets than those passengers that pre-bought their tickets. The answer is 2900.\n\n\nQ: Samuel is going to the cinema with his brother, Kevin. They both have a total budget of $20 for their outing. Samuel buys his $14 ticket, then spends $6 on drinks and food. Kevin buys his ticket, then spends $2 on drinks. They have both used their entire budget. How much did Kevin spend on food?\nA: Let's think step by step. Samuel spent $14 on his ticket and $6 on food and drinks, which means he spent a total of $20. This means that Kevin must have spent $0 on food and drinks, since they both used their entire budget of $20. Therefore, Kevin spent $6 on his ticket and $2 on drinks, which means he spent a total of $8. Since he didn't spend any money on food, the answer is $0. The answer is 0.\n\n\nQ: Jack has $45 and 36 euros. If each euro is worth two dollars, how much money does he have total in dollars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the euros to dollars. We know that each euro is worth two dollars, so we can multiply the number of euros by 2 to get the total value in dollars. 36 euros x 2 dollars/euro = 72 dollars Now we can add the dollars and euros together to get the total amount in dollars. 45 dollars + 72 dollars = 117 dollars Therefore, Jack has a total of 117 dollars. The answer is 117.\n\n\n"
