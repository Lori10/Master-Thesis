  "test_question": "Q: Last Friday, 13 of the 82 teachers at Rydell Elementary School were sick. There were 9 substitute teachers called in to help. How many teachers were at school that day?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Dani brings two and half dozen cupcakes for her 2nd-grade class.  There are 27 students (including Dani), 1 teacher, and 1 teacher\u2019s aid.  If 3 students called in sick that day, how many cupcakes are left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Dani brought in total. Two and a half dozen cupcakes is equal to 30 cupcakes (since a dozen is 12). Next, we need to figure out how many people will be receiving cupcakes. There are 27 students, 1 teacher, and 1 teacher's aid, for a total of 29 people. However, 3 students called in sick, so we need to subtract them from the total. 29 - 3 = 26 people receiving cupcakes. Now, we need to subtract 26 cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes Dani brought. 30 - 26 = 4 cupcakes left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Forty percent of the students have elected to learn from home during the pandemic. The remaining students are divided into two equal groups, only one of which is physically in school on any day. What percent of students are present in school?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Let's assume that there are 100 students in total. Step 2: 40% of the students have elected to learn from home during the pandemic. So, the number of students learning from home is 40% of 100, which is 40. Step 3: The remaining students are 60 (100 - 40). Step 4: The remaining students are divided into two equal groups, so each group has 30 students. Step 5: Only one of the two groups is physically in school on any day. So, the number of students present in school is 30. Step 6: To find the percentage of students present in school, we need to divide the number of students present in school by the total number of students and multiply by 100. 30/100 x 100 = 30% Therefore, 30% of students are present in school. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: There are 13 3-year-olds, 20 4-year-olds, 15 5-year-olds, and 22 six-year-olds at a particular Sunday school. If the 3 and 4-year-olds are in one class and the 5 and 6-year-olds are in another class, what is the average class size?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of students in each class. For the 3 and 4-year-olds class, we add the number of 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds: 13 + 20 = 33 For the 5 and 6-year-olds class, we add the number of 5-year-olds and 6-year-olds: 15 + 22 = 37 Next, we need to find the average class size. To do this, we add the total number of students in both classes and divide by the number of classes: (33 + 37) / 2 = 35 Therefore, the average class size is 35 students. The answer is 35.\n\n\nQ: A teacher is making packed lunches for a field trip. Each student needs 2 sandwiches, and will travel in a group with 5 other students. There are a total of 5 groups. How many pieces of bread will the teacher need to make enough sandwiches for all the students?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of students going on the field trip. Since each group has 6 students (1 student + 5 others), and there are 5 groups, the total number of students is: 6 students/group x 5 groups = 30 students Step 2: Find the total number of sandwiches needed. Since each student needs 2 sandwiches, the total number of sandwiches needed is: 2 sandwiches/student x 30 students = 60 sandwiches Step 3: Find the total number of bread slices needed. Since each sandwich has 2 slices of bread, the total number of bread slices needed is: 2 slices/sandwich x 60 sandwiches = 120 slices of bread Therefore, the teacher will need 120 slices of bread to make enough sandwiches for all the students. The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many students are in Alice's class. We know that there are 40 students and 10 instructors, so the total number of people in the class is 40 + 10 = 50. Next, we need to figure out how many students are bringing their own life vests. We know that 20% of the students are bringing life vests, so we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of students by 0.2: 40 x 0.2 = 8. So 8 students are bringing their own life vests. Now we need to figure out how many life vests we still need. We have 20 life vests on hand, and we need one for each of the 50 people in the class. So we need 50 - 20 = 30 more life vests. However, we already know that 8 students are bringing their own life vests, so we can subtract those from the total number we need: 30 - 8 = 22. Therefore, Alice needs to get 22 more life vests so that the entire class has one. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: In a school, the number of participants in the 2018 Science Quiz Bowl was 150. There were 20 more than twice the number of participants in 2019 as there were in 2018. In 2020, the number of participants was 40 less than half the number of participants in 2019. How many more participants were there in 2019 than in 2020?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many participants there were in 2019. We know that there were 20 more than twice the number of participants in 2018, so we can set up an equation: 2019 participants = 20 + 2 * 2018 participants 2019 participants = 20 + 2 * 150 2019 participants = 320 Next, we need to find out how many participants there were in 2020. We know that the number of participants in 2020 was 40 less than half the number of participants in 2019, so we can set up another equation: 2020 participants = 0.5 * 2019 participants - 40 2020 participants = 0.5 * 320 - 40 2020 participants = 80 Finally, we can find out how many more participants there were in 2019 than in 2020: 2019 participants - 2020 participants = 320 - 80 = 240 Therefore, there were 240 more participants in 2019 than in 2020. The answer is 2020.\n\n\nQ: Peggy fell off her bike and skinned her knees.  She needed two bandages on her left knee and three bandages on her right knee.  If the box of bandages had 8 less than two dozen bandages before Peggy skinned her knees, how many bandages were left in the box after Peggy finished putting bandages on her knees?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many bandages Peggy used in total. We know she used two on her left knee and three on her right knee, so: 2 + 3 = 5 Peggy used 5 bandages in total. Next, we need to figure out how many bandages were in the box before Peggy used any. We know the box had 8 less than two dozen bandages, which means: 2 dozen = 24 24 - 8 = 16 There were 16 bandages in the box before Peggy used any. Finally, we need to figure out how many bandages were left in the box after Peggy used 5. We can do this by subtracting 5 from 16: 16 - 5 = 11 There were 11 bandages left in the box after Peggy finished putting bandages on her knees. The answer is 11.\n\n\nQ: On a moonless night, three fireflies danced in the evening breeze.  They were joined by four less than a dozen more fireflies, before two of the fireflies flew away.  How many fireflies remained?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there were three fireflies dancing. Then, four less than a dozen (which is 12) more fireflies joined them. So, we can add 12-4=8 fireflies to the original three, making a total of 11 fireflies. Next, two of the fireflies flew away, so we need to subtract 2 from the 11 fireflies. Therefore, the final answer is 11-2=9 fireflies remained. The answer is 9.\n\n\n"
