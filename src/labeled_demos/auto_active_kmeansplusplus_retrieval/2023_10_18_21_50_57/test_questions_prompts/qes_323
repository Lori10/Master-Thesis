  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Marie, the confectioner, makes 12 chocolate eggs, each weighing 10 ounces. She then packs an equal number of the eggs in 4 different gift boxes. Unfortunately, she leaves one of the boxes by the kitchen window and the afternoon sun melts everything. She tosses that box out. What is the total weight, in ounces, of the remaining chocolate eggs?\nA: Let's think step by step. Marie makes 12 chocolate eggs, each weighing 10 ounces. So the total weight of all the eggs is: 12 x 10 = 120 ounces Marie packs an equal number of eggs in 4 different gift boxes. So each box contains: 120 / 4 = 30 ounces But one of the boxes is tossed out, so we need to subtract the weight of that box from the total weight of the eggs. Therefore, the total weight of the remaining chocolate eggs is: (3 boxes) x (30 ounces per box) = 90 ounces The answer is 90.\n\n\nQ: Ivan has 20 dice. Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. How many dice do they have altogether?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Ivan has 20 dice. Next, we know that Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. So, we can multiply Ivan's number of dice by 2 to find Jerry's number of dice: 20 x 2 = 40 Therefore, Jerry has 40 dice. To find the total number of dice they have altogether, we can add Ivan's and Jerry's number of dice: 20 + 40 = 60 Therefore, they have 60 dice altogether. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Each turtle lays a clutch of 20 eggs. If 40% of the eggs successfully hatch, how many hatchlings do 6 turtles produce?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many eggs 6 turtles lay in total. Since each turtle lays a clutch of 20 eggs, 6 turtles will lay: 6 x 20 = 120 eggs Next, we need to find out how many of these eggs will successfully hatch. If 40% of the eggs hatch, we can find out how many hatchlings we get by multiplying the total number of eggs by 40% (or 0.4): 120 x 0.4 = 48 hatchlings Therefore, 6 turtles will produce 48 hatchlings. The answer is 48.\n\n\nQ: Martin owns a farm with hens. 10 hens do lay 80 eggs in 10 days. Martin decided to buy 15 more hens. How many eggs will all hens lay in 15 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many eggs one hen lays in 10 days. We can do this by dividing the total number of eggs laid by 10 hens by 10 days: 80 eggs \u00f7 10 hens \u00f7 10 days = 0.8 eggs per hen per day Now that we know how many eggs one hen lays per day, we can find out how many eggs all 25 hens will lay in 15 days: 25 hens \u00d7 0.8 eggs per hen per day \u00d7 15 days = 300 eggs Therefore, all 25 hens will lay 300 eggs in 15 days. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Giselle had 20 female doves in a birdhouse. After a month, the doves laid 3 eggs each. If 3/4 of the eggs hatched, calculate the total number of doves Giselle has now.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many eggs were laid in total. Since each dove laid 3 eggs, we can multiply the number of doves by 3: 20 doves x 3 eggs/dove = 60 eggs Next, we need to find out how many of those eggs hatched. We know that 3/4 of the eggs hatched, so we can multiply the total number of eggs by 3/4: 60 eggs x 3/4 = 45 eggs hatched Finally, we need to add the number of original doves (20) to the number of hatched eggs (45) to find the total number of doves: 20 doves + 45 doves = 65 doves Therefore, Giselle now has 65 doves. The answer is 65.\n\n\nQ: Shane prepares sandwiches for the Boy Scouts. He buys 2 packages of sliced bread containing 20 slices each, and he also buys 2 packages of sliced ham containing 8 slices each. Shane will make as many sandwiches as he can according to the ham he has. How many slices of bread will he have leftover?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of ham Shane has in total. 2 packages of sliced ham containing 8 slices each = 2 x 8 = 16 slices of ham Now, we know that Shane will make as many sandwiches as he can according to the ham he has. Since each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread, we can calculate the maximum number of sandwiches he can make: 16 slices of ham / 2 slices of bread per sandwich = 8 sandwiches So, Shane will make 8 sandwiches. Each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread, so he will use: 8 sandwiches x 2 slices of bread per sandwich = 16 slices of bread Shane has 2 packages of sliced bread containing 20 slices each, so he has: 2 packages x 20 slices per package = 40 slices of bread Therefore, he will have: 40 slices of bread - 16 slices of bread used = 24 slices of bread leftover. So, Shane will have 24 slices of bread leftover. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: There were 90 jellybeans in a jar. Samantha snuck 24 jellybeans out of the jar, without being seen. Shelby ate 12 jellybeans from the jar. Their mom, Shannon, refilled the jar with half as much as Samantha and Shelby took out. How many jellybeans are in the jar now?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Samantha took out 24 jellybeans from the jar. Step 2: Shelby ate 12 jellybeans from the jar. Step 3: The total number of jellybeans taken out of the jar is 24 + 12 = 36. Step 4: Shannon refilled the jar with half as much as Samantha and Shelby took out, which is 1/2 * 36 = 18 jellybeans. Step 5: The total number of jellybeans in the jar now is 90 - 36 + 18 = 72 jellybeans. Therefore, there are 72 jellybeans in the jar now. The answer is 72.\n\n\nQ: Dante needs half as many cups of flour to bake his chocolate cake as he needs eggs. If he uses 60 eggs in his recipe, calculate the total number of cups of flour and eggs that he uses altogether.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cups of flour Dante needs. We know that he needs half as many cups of flour as he needs eggs. So, if he needs 60 eggs, he needs half as many cups of flour, which is 60/2 = 30 cups of flour. Next, we need to calculate the total number of cups of flour and eggs that Dante uses altogether. Dante uses 60 eggs and 30 cups of flour, so the total number of cups of flour and eggs that he uses altogether is 60 + 30 = 90. Therefore, Dante uses a total of 90 cups of flour and eggs altogether in his recipe. The answer is 90.\n\n\n"
