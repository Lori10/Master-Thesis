  "test_question": "Q: James decided to walk to the store.  When he got halfway there he realized he forgot something at home and had to walk back.  If his home is 4 miles from the store and he walks 4 miles per hour how long did it take him to reach the store?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Two old ladies spent the afternoon walking through Central Park.  The first lady walked twice as far as the second lady.  If the second lady walked four miles, what is the combined total distance, in miles, the two ladies walked?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the second lady walked 4 miles. Next, we know that the first lady walked twice as far as the second lady. So, we can multiply the second lady's distance by 2 to find the first lady's distance: 4 miles x 2 = 8 miles Therefore, the combined total distance the two ladies walked is: 4 miles + 8 miles = 12 miles The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: A train takes 4 hours to reach a destination at a speed of 50 miles per hour. How long would it take if it traveled at 100 miles per hour instead?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time We know that the distance is the same in both scenarios, so we can set the two equations equal to each other: 50 miles/hour x 4 hours = 100 miles/hour x time Simplifying this equation, we get: 200 miles = 100 miles/hour x time Dividing both sides by 100 miles/hour, we get: time = 2 hours Therefore, if the train traveled at 100 miles per hour instead of 50 miles per hour, it would take 2 hours to reach the destination. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Richard starts walking from Cincinnati to New York City, which is 70 miles. Richards walks 20 miles the first day. The next day he walks 6 miles less than half as much as he walked the first day. He walks 10 miles the third day. How many miles further does Richard have to walk to be in New York City?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Richard walks 20 miles. On the second day, he walks 6 miles less than half as much as he walked the first day. Half of what he walked on the first day is 20/2 = 10 miles. So, he walks 10 - 6 = 4 miles on the second day. On the third day, he walks 10 miles. Therefore, the total distance Richard has walked so far is 20 + 4 + 10 = 34 miles. To reach New York City, which is 70 miles away, Richard still has to walk 70 - 34 = 36 miles further. The answer is 36.\n\n\nQ: Colin ran his first mile in 6 minutes.  He ran his next two miles in 5 minutes each and finished his 4th mile in 4 minutes.  What was the average time it took him to run a mile?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total time it took Colin to run all four miles. - Colin's first mile took 6 minutes. - His next two miles took 5 minutes each, so that's a total of 10 minutes. - His fourth mile took 4 minutes. To find the total time, we add these up: 6 + 10 + 4 = 20 So Colin ran four miles in a total of 20 minutes. To find the average time it took him to run a mile, we divide the total time by the number of miles: 20 / 4 = 5 So Colin's average time to run a mile was 5 minutes. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Mr. Maxwell takes 1 hr to drive to work in the morning but 1 and half hours to drive back home in the evening. If the morning and evening traffic is similar and he drives at an average speed of 30mph in the morning, what is the average speed of his return journey?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time Since Mr. Maxwell drives at an average speed of 30mph in the morning and takes 1 hour to drive to work, we can calculate the distance he travels in the morning as: distance = 30 x 1 = 30 miles Now, we know that the distance he travels in the evening is the same as the distance he travels in the morning (assuming he takes the same route). So, we can use the formula again to find his average speed in the evening: speed = distance / time We know the distance is 30 miles, but we need to find the time it takes him to drive back home. We're told that it takes him 1 and a half hours, which we can also write as 1.5 hours. Therefore, his average speed in the evening is: speed = 30 / 1.5 = 20 mph So, the average speed of his return journey is 20 mph. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Danny helps his friends carpool to work. He has to drive 8 miles to the first friend's house, half that distance to the second friend's house, then 3 times the total distance driven so far to get to work. How many miles does Danny drive between the second friend's house and work?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Danny drives 8 miles to the first friend's house. Then, he drives half that distance, which is 4 miles, to the second friend's house. So far, he has driven 8 + 4 = 12 miles. Next, he drives 3 times the total distance driven so far to get to work. The total distance driven so far is 12 miles, so he drives 3 x 12 = 36 miles to get to work. To find out how many miles Danny drives between the second friend's house and work, we need to subtract the distance he has already driven (8 miles to the first friend's house and 4 miles to the second friend's house) from the total distance he drives to get to work. So, Danny drives 36 - 8 - 4 = 24 miles between the second friend's house and work. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Jeff was driving to the capital city to attend a conference. At first, he was driving at 80 miles/hour for about 6 hours, then the speed limit changed and he had to slow down to 60 miles/hour, and so he drove at this speed for 4 hours. Then he made a stop at a gas station. Once the car was full of gas, he drove at 40 miles/hour the rest of the trip for 2 hours. How many miles did he travel?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how far Jeff traveled at 80 miles/hour for 6 hours. We can use the formula distance = speed x time. distance = 80 miles/hour x 6 hours = 480 miles Next, we need to find out how far Jeff traveled at 60 miles/hour for 4 hours. distance = 60 miles/hour x 4 hours = 240 miles Then, we need to find out how far Jeff traveled at 40 miles/hour for 2 hours. distance = 40 miles/hour x 2 hours = 80 miles Finally, we can add up all the distances to find the total distance Jeff traveled. total distance = 480 miles + 240 miles + 80 miles = 800 miles Therefore, Jeff traveled 800 miles to attend the conference. The answer is 800.\n\n\nQ: A car driving cross-country traveled 180 miles in 4 hours. At this rate of speed, how many miles further will the car travel in the next 3 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the car's speed in miles per hour (mph). To do this, we divide the distance traveled by the time taken: Speed = Distance \u00f7 Time Speed = 180 miles \u00f7 4 hours Speed = 45 mph Now that we know the car's speed, we can use it to calculate how far it will travel in the next 3 hours: Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time Distance = 45 mph \u00d7 3 hours Distance = 135 miles Therefore, the car will travel 135 miles further in the next 3 hours. The answer is 3.\n\n\n"
