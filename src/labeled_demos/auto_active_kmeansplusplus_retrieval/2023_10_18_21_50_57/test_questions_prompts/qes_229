  "test_question": "Q: Marcy makes homemade candles that she markets as 99% guaranteed not to explode. 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. If she makes 50000 candles, how many of them will both smell like wet dog and explode?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Stephanie is decorating 24 cupcakes for a birthday party, but she needs more candles. She currently has a total of 30 candles. She wants to decorate half of the cupcakes with 1 candle each and the other half of the cupcakes with 2 candles each. How many additional candles does Stephanie need to complete the cupcakes?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that Stephanie is decorating 24 cupcakes in total. Step 2: She wants to decorate half of the cupcakes with 1 candle each, which means she needs 12 candles for those cupcakes (12 cupcakes x 1 candle each = 12 candles). Step 3: She wants to decorate the other half of the cupcakes with 2 candles each, which means she needs 24 candles for those cupcakes (12 cupcakes x 2 candles each = 24 candles). Step 4: In total, she needs 36 candles (30 candles she already has + 12 candles for the first half of cupcakes + 24 candles for the second half of cupcakes = 66 candles). Step 5: To complete the cupcakes, Stephanie needs 6 more candles (36 candles needed - 30 candles she already has = 6 candles). The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Ethan makes beeswax candles.  For each candle, he uses 8 ounces of beeswax and 1 ounce of coconut oil.  If he makes three less than 10 candles, what will be the combined weight of the candles in ounces?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many candles Ethan makes. We know that he makes three less than 10 candles, so: 10 - 3 = 7 candles Next, we need to find out how much beeswax and coconut oil Ethan uses for each candle. We know that he uses 8 ounces of beeswax and 1 ounce of coconut oil for each candle, so: 8 + 1 = 9 ounces per candle Now we can find out the total weight of all the candles by multiplying the number of candles by the weight of each candle: 7 x 9 = 63 ounces Therefore, the combined weight of the candles in ounces will be 63 ounces. The answer is 63.\n\n\nQ: Jackson is making pancakes with three ingredients: flour, milk and eggs. 20% of the bottles of milk are spoiled and the rest are fresh. 60% of the eggs are rotten. 1/4 of the cannisters of flour have weevils in them. If Jackson picks a bottle of milk, an egg and a canister of flour at random, what are the odds all three ingredients will be good?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the probability that a bottle of milk is fresh. We know that 20% of the bottles are spoiled, so 80% are fresh. Next, we need to find the probability that an egg is not rotten. We know that 60% of the eggs are rotten, so 40% are not. Finally, we need to find the probability that a canister of flour does not have weevils. We know that 1/4 of the canisters have weevils, so 3/4 do not. To find the probability that all three ingredients are good, we need to multiply the probabilities of each event happening: 0.8 (probability of fresh milk) x 0.4 (probability of not rotten egg) x 0.75 (probability of no weevils in flour) = 0.24 So the odds of all three ingredients being good are 0.24 or 24%. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Brenda bakes 20 cakes a day. She does this for 9 days and then sells half of the cakes. How many cakes are left with Brenda?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cakes Brenda bakes in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of cakes she bakes per day (20) by the number of days she bakes (9): 20 cakes/day x 9 days = 180 cakes So Brenda bakes 180 cakes in total. Next, we need to find out how many cakes Brenda sells. We know she sells half of the cakes, which is the same as dividing the total number of cakes by 2: 180 cakes / 2 = 90 cakes So Brenda sells 90 cakes. Finally, we need to find out how many cakes Brenda has left. To do this, we can subtract the number of cakes she sold from the total number of cakes she baked: 180 cakes - 90 cakes = 90 cakes So Brenda has 90 cakes left. The answer is 90.\n\n\nQ: Eric sorted 150 colored pencils into 5 containers for his art class. Before class, another teacher brought him 30 more pencils. How many can he evenly distribute between the five containers now?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of pencils Eric has now. To do this, we add the original 150 pencils to the 30 pencils brought by the other teacher: 150 + 30 = 180 So Eric now has 180 colored pencils. Next, we need to find out how many pencils he can evenly distribute between the five containers. To do this, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of containers: 180 \u00f7 5 = 36 Therefore, Eric can evenly distribute 36 colored pencils between each of the five containers. The answer is 36.\n\n\nQ: Randy walks his dog twice a day.  After each walk, he wipes his dog's paws off with a baby wipe.  The baby wipes come 120 wipes per pack.  How many packs will he need to make sure he has enough wipes for 360 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how many baby wipes Randy uses per day. Since he walks his dog twice a day and wipes his paws off after each walk, he uses 2 baby wipes per day. Next, we need to figure out how many baby wipes he will need for 360 days. To do this, we can multiply the number of baby wipes he uses per day by the number of days he needs them for: 2 baby wipes/day x 360 days = 720 baby wipes Finally, we need to figure out how many packs of baby wipes he will need to buy to get 720 baby wipes. Since there are 120 baby wipes per pack, we can divide 720 by 120: 720 baby wipes \u00f7 120 baby wipes/pack = 6 packs Therefore, Randy will need to buy 6 packs of baby wipes to make sure he has enough for 360 days. The answer is 360.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Mary wants 144 cupcakes for her party. Mary has already made 36 cherry cupcakes, and 48 berry cupcakes. Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes for the rest. How much of each should she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Mary has already made: 36 cherry + 48 berry = 84 cupcakes Next, we need to figure out how many more cupcakes Mary needs to make: 144 total cupcakes - 84 cupcakes already made = 60 cupcakes Since Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, we can divide the remaining 60 cupcakes by 2: 60 cupcakes \u00f7 2 = 30 cupcakes of each flavor Therefore, Mary should make 30 chocolate cupcakes and 30 vanilla cupcakes to have a total of 144 cupcakes for her party. The answer is 144.\n\n\n"
