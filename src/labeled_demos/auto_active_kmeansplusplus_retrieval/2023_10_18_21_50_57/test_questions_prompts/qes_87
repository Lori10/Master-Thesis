  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Tropical Storm Sally brings 3 days of rain to southern Texas.  The first day it rained 4 inches.  The second day it rained 5 times as much as the first day, and the third day it rained 6 inches less than the sum of the first two days.  How much did it rain on the third day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First day: 4 inches Second day: 5 times as much as the first day = 5 x 4 = 20 inches Third day: 6 inches less than the sum of the first two days = (4 + 20) - 6 = 18 inches Therefore, it rained 18 inches on the third day. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: James and 4 of his friends volunteered to plant flowers. In 2 days, they were able to plant a total of 200 flowers. If each of them planted the same number of flowers, how many flowers did James plant in a day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people were planting flowers. We know that James and 4 of his friends volunteered, so there were 5 people in total. Next, we need to find out how many flowers each person planted in 2 days. To do this, we can divide the total number of flowers planted (200) by the number of people (5) and the number of days (2): 200 \u00f7 5 \u00f7 2 = 20 So each person planted 20 flowers in 2 days. Finally, we need to find out how many flowers James planted in 1 day. Since each person planted 20 flowers in 2 days, we can divide that by 2 to find out how many flowers each person planted in 1 day: 20 \u00f7 2 = 10 Therefore, James planted 10 flowers in 1 day. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: John takes a pill every 6 hours.  How many pills does he take a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 24 hours in a day, so John takes 24/6 = 4 pills per day. In a week, there are 7 days, so John takes 4 x 7 = 28 pills per week. The answer is 28.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: Next year, there will be twice as many people going to the fair as are going this year, and the number of people who went to the fair last year was 200 less than those going next year. If the number of people going to the fair this year is 600, calculate the number of people at the fair in the three years.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the number of people going to the fair next year will be twice the number of people going this year. So, we can calculate: Number of people going to the fair next year = 2 * 600 = 1200 Next, we know that the number of people who went to the fair last year was 200 less than those going next year. So, we can calculate: Number of people who went to the fair last year = 1200 - 200 = 1000 Finally, we want to calculate the total number of people at the fair in the three years. So, we can add up the number of people going this year, next year, and last year: Total number of people at the fair in the three years = 600 + 1200 + 1000 = 2800 Therefore, there will be 2800 people at the fair in the three years. The answer is 2800.\n\n\nQ: A group of 30 tourists sets out on a walking tour of the rainforest. Two tourists are eaten by anacondas, then half the remaining tourists try to pet poisonous dart frogs and get poisoned. If only 1/7 of the poisoned tourists recovered, how many tourists are left at the end of the tour?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Start with 30 tourists. Step 2: Two tourists are eaten by anacondas, so we subtract 2 from 30 to get 28 tourists remaining. Step 3: Half of the remaining tourists try to pet poisonous dart frogs and get poisoned. Half of 28 is 14, so we subtract 14 from 28 to get 14 tourists remaining. Step 4: Only 1/7 of the poisoned tourists recovered. 1/7 of 14 is 2, so we add 2 to the 14 tourists remaining to get 16 tourists at the end of the tour. Therefore, there are 16 tourists left at the end of the tour. The answer is 16.\n\n\nQ: Jeff has a shelter where he currently takes care of 20 cats. On Monday he found 2 kittens in a box and took them to the shelter. On Tuesday he found 1 more cat with a leg injury. On Wednesday 3 people adopted 2 cats each. How many cats does Jeff currently have in his shelter?\nA: Let's think step by step. Jeff had 20 cats in his shelter. On Monday he found 2 kittens and took them to the shelter, so he now has 20 + 2 = 22 cats. On Tuesday he found 1 more cat with a leg injury, so he now has 22 + 1 = 23 cats. On Wednesday, 3 people adopted 2 cats each, which means a total of 3 x 2 = 6 cats were adopted. Therefore, Jeff currently has 23 - 6 = 17 cats in his shelter. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Aliya and her classmates are sent by their teacher to the field to collect insects for science class study. The Boys collected 200 insects and the girls collected 300 insects. The teacher decided to divide the class equally into four groups that each get an equal number of insects so that each group could study together. What was the number of insects given to each group?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of insects collected by the class. Total number of insects = 200 (boys) + 300 (girls) = 500 Step 2: Divide the total number of insects by the number of groups. Number of insects per group = 500 \u00f7 4 = 125 Step 3: Therefore, each group will get 125 insects to study. The answer is 125.\n\n\n"
