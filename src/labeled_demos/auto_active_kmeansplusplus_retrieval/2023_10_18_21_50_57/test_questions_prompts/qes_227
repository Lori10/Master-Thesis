  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Stella and Twinkle are filling up a truck with a capacity of 6000 stone blocks at the rate of 250 blocks per hour per person. They work for four hours and are then joined by 6 other people who also work at the same rate. How many hours did filling the truck take?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many blocks Stella and Twinkle can fill in 4 hours. 250 blocks per hour per person x 2 people x 4 hours = 2000 blocks So, after 4 hours, Stella and Twinkle have filled 2000 blocks. Next, we need to find out how many blocks all 8 people can fill in one hour. 250 blocks per hour per person x 8 people = 2000 blocks So, all 8 people can fill 2000 blocks in one hour. Now, we need to find out how many more blocks they need to fill to reach the capacity of 6000 blocks. 6000 blocks - 2000 blocks = 4000 blocks Finally, we can use the rate of 2000 blocks per hour for all 8 people to find out how many hours it will take to fill the remaining 4000 blocks. 4000 blocks \u00f7 2000 blocks per hour = 2 hours Therefore, filling the truck took a total of 4 + 2 = 6 hours. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: A train leaves its departure station with 6 coal cars, 12 iron cars, and 2 wood cars. Between each station, there are 6 miles, and it takes 25 minutes to travel between them. At each station, the train can deposit up to 2 coal cars, 3 iron cars, and 1 wood car. How many minutes will it take to deliver all the cars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find the total number of cars the train has: 6 coal cars + 12 iron cars + 2 wood cars = 20 cars Next, let's find the maximum number of cars the train can deposit at each station: 2 coal cars + 3 iron cars + 1 wood car = 6 cars To deliver all 20 cars, the train will need to make multiple trips between stations. For each trip, the train can deposit 6 cars. So, the number of trips the train will need to make is: 20 cars \u00f7 6 cars per trip = 3.33 trips Since the train cannot make a partial trip, it will need to make 4 trips. Each trip takes 25 minutes, so the total time it will take to deliver all the cars is: 4 trips x 25 minutes per trip = 100 minutes The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Jerry works as an independent contractor for a company that pays him $40 per task. If each task takes him two hours to complete and he works 10 hours a day for a whole week, calculate the total amount of money he would earn at the end of the week.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many tasks Jerry can complete in a day. Since each task takes him two hours to complete, he can complete 10/2 = 5 tasks in a day. Next, we need to find out how many tasks Jerry can complete in a week. Since he works 10 hours a day for a whole week, he works a total of 10*7 = 70 hours in a week. Therefore, he can complete 70/2 = 35 tasks in a week. Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money Jerry would earn at the end of the week. Since he earns $40 per task, he would earn a total of 40*35 = $1400 at the end of the week. The answer is 1400.\n\n\nQ: A factory uses robots to manufacture batteries. For each battery that is made, it takes a robot 6 minutes to gather the materials for the battery and 9 minutes to create the battery. If the factory has 10 robots working on batteries at the same time, how many batteries can the robots manufacture in 5 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 5 hours to minutes. 5 hours = 5 x 60 = 300 minutes Next, we need to find out how long it takes for one robot to make one battery. 6 minutes to gather materials + 9 minutes to create battery = 15 minutes per battery Now we can calculate how many batteries one robot can make in 300 minutes. 300 minutes \u00f7 15 minutes per battery = 20 batteries Finally, we can multiply the number of batteries one robot can make by the number of robots working. 20 batteries per robot x 10 robots = 200 batteries Therefore, the robots can manufacture 200 batteries in 5 hours. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Martin owns a farm with hens. 10 hens do lay 80 eggs in 10 days. Martin decided to buy 15 more hens. How many eggs will all hens lay in 15 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many eggs one hen lays in 10 days. We can do this by dividing the total number of eggs laid by 10 hens by 10 days: 80 eggs \u00f7 10 hens \u00f7 10 days = 0.8 eggs per hen per day Now that we know how many eggs one hen lays per day, we can find out how many eggs all 25 hens will lay in 15 days: 25 hens \u00d7 0.8 eggs per hen per day \u00d7 15 days = 300 eggs Therefore, all 25 hens will lay 300 eggs in 15 days. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Jan enters a double dutch competition.  After training she doubles her speed which used to be 70 skips per minute.  How many skips does she do in 5 minutes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out Jan's new speed after doubling it. 70 skips per minute x 2 = 140 skips per minute Now that we know Jan's new speed, we can find out how many skips she does in 5 minutes. 140 skips per minute x 5 minutes = 700 skips Therefore, Jan does 700 skips in 5 minutes after doubling her speed. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Peter and Kristin are to read 20 fantasy novels each in a week. Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin. If Peter reads one book in 18 hours, how long will Kristin read half of her books?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Peter to read one book. We know that he can read one book in 18 hours, so we can write: Peter's reading speed = 1 book / 18 hours Next, we need to find out how long it takes Kristin to read one book. We know that Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin, so we can write: Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * Peter's reading speed Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * (1 book / 18 hours) Kristin's reading speed = 1 book / 54 hours Now we can use Kristin's reading speed to find out how long it takes her to read half of her books. We know that she needs to read 20 books in a week, so she needs to read 10 books in half a week (3.5 days). We can write: Time to read 10 books = 10 books * (1 book / 54 hours) * (24 hours / 1 day) * (3.5 days) Time to read 10 books = 14 hours and 27 minutes Therefore, it will take Kristin 14 hours and 27 minutes to read half of her books. The answer is 27.\n\n\nQ: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of 18 watermelons. Since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, the total weight of 18 watermelons would be: 23 x 18 = 414 pounds Next, we need to find the total amount of money Farmer Kent would make by selling these watermelons. Since he sells them for $2 a pound, we can multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 414 x $2 = $828 Therefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight. The answer is 18.\n\n\n"
