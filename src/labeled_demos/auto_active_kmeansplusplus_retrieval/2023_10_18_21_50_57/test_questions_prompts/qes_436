In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. What's the total number of goals scored in the match?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A soccer team had 24 players prepared for a soccer game. The first half saw 11 players start the game with 2 substitutions made. In the second half, the team made twice as many substitutions as it made in the first half. How many players on the team did not play that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many players played in the first half. We know that 11 players started the game, and 2 substitutions were made, so a total of 13 players played in the first half. Next, we need to find out how many substitutions were made in the second half. We know that the team made twice as many substitutions as it made in the first half, so that means 2 x 2 = 4 substitutions were made in the second half. Now we can calculate how many players played in the second half. We know that there were 13 players who played in the first half, and 4 substitutions were made, so a total of 17 players played in the second half. Finally, we can calculate how many players did not play that day. We know that the team had 24 players prepared for the game, and 13 players played in the first half, and 17 players played in the second half. So, 24 - 13 - 17 = 4 players did not play that day. Therefore, there were 4 players on the team who did not play that day. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: The number of goals scored in a game against Barca by exactly two players last season accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league. If the players scored an equal number of goals, and the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300, calculate the number of goals each of the two players scored.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the number of goals scored by the two players accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league against Barca. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 0.2 * total goals in the league against Barca = number of goals scored by the two players We also know that the two players scored an equal number of goals, so we can let x be the number of goals each player scored. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as: 0.2 * 300 = 2x Simplifying the equation, we get: 60 = 2x Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 30 Therefore, each player scored 30 goals. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: During her first year playing soccer, Tara's dad attended 90% of the games she played.  In her second year playing soccer, Tara's dad attended 4 fewer games than he did in the previous year.  If Tara played 20 games each year, how many games did Tara's dad attend in her second year playing soccer?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many games Tara's dad attended in her first year playing soccer. We know that he attended 90% of the games, which means he attended: 90% of 20 games = 0.9 x 20 = 18 games So Tara's dad attended 18 games in her first year playing soccer. Next, we need to find out how many games Tara's dad attended in her second year playing soccer. We know that he attended 4 fewer games than he did in the previous year, which means he attended: 18 games - 4 games = 14 games So Tara's dad attended 14 games in her second year playing soccer. The answer is 14.\n\n\nQ: Jordan is a hockey goalie. In the first period of a game, he blocked four shots. In the second period, he blocked twice as many shots. In the third period, he blocked three fewer than in the second period. When the game ended after the fourth period, he had blocked 21 shots in all. How many did Jordan block in the fourth period?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Jordan blocked 4 shots in the first period. In the second period, he blocked twice as many shots as in the first period, so he blocked 4 x 2 = 8 shots. In the third period, he blocked three fewer than in the second period, so he blocked 8 - 3 = 5 shots. We know that he blocked a total of 21 shots in all four periods, so we can set up an equation: 4 + 8 + 5 + x = 21 where x is the number of shots he blocked in the fourth period. Simplifying the equation: 17 + x = 21 Subtracting 17 from both sides: x = 4 Therefore, Jordan blocked 4 shots in the fourth period. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Frankie and Carla played 30 games of ping pong against each other.  Frankie won half as many games as did Carla.  How many games did Carla win?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can start by using algebra to represent the problem. Let's say that Carla won x number of games. Then, we know that Frankie won half as many games as Carla, which means Frankie won (1/2)x games. Next, we know that they played a total of 30 games, so we can set up an equation: x + (1/2)x = 30 We can simplify this equation by combining like terms: (3/2)x = 30 To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/2, which is 2/3: x = (2/3) * 30 x = 20 Therefore, Carla won 20 games. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Nine hundred tickets were sold to a concert. Three-fourths of those who bought the ticket came before the start of the concert. Five-ninths of the remaining came few minutes after the first song. Eighty people arrived during the middle part of the concert while the rest did not go. How many of those who bought the tickets did not go?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many people came before the start of the concert. Three-fourths of 900 tickets = (3/4) x 900 = 675 people came before the start of the concert. Step 2: Find out how many people were left after the first group came. 900 - 675 = 225 people were left. Step 3: Find out how many people came few minutes after the first song. Five-ninths of the remaining 225 people = (5/9) x 225 = 125 people came few minutes after the first song. Step 4: Find out how many people were left after the second group came. 225 - 125 = 100 people were left. Step 5: Subtract the number of people who arrived during the middle part of the concert from the number of people left. 100 - 80 = 20 people did not go to the concert. Therefore, 20 people who bought the tickets did not go to the concert. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Joe played catch with Derek and Tammy. He caught the ball 23 times. Derek made four less than double the catches Joe did. Tammy caught the ball sixteen more than a third of the times Derek did. How many times did Tammy catch the ball?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Joe caught the ball 23 times. Next, we need to figure out how many times Derek caught the ball. We know that he made four less than double the catches Joe did. So, we can set up an equation: Derek's catches = 2(Joe's catches) - 4 Derek's catches = 2(23) - 4 Derek's catches = 42 Now we need to figure out how many times Tammy caught the ball. We know that she caught the ball sixteen more than a third of the times Derek did. So, we can set up an equation: Tammy's catches = (1/3)(Derek's catches) + 16 Tammy's catches = (1/3)(42) + 16 Tammy's catches = 14 + 16 Tammy's catches = 30 Therefore, Tammy caught the ball 30 times. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Bertha started with two balls and gave one to her partner, so she has one ball left. Next, we need to figure out how many balls she loses and how many wear out. In 20 games, she loses 20/5 = 4 balls and 20/10 = 2 balls wear out. Finally, we need to figure out how many balls she buys. In 20 games, she buys 20/4 = 5 canisters of three balls, which is a total of 5*3 = 15 balls. So, in total, Bertha has 1 (starting ball) - 4 (lost balls) - 2 (worn out balls) + 15 (bought balls) = 10 tennis balls. The answer is 10.\n\n\n"
