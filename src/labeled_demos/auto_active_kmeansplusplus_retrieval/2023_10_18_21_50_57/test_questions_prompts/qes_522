  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Tom turned 32 years old 5 years ago.  7 years ago Jim was 5 years older than half Tom's age.  How old is Jim in 2 years?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find Tom's current age. We know that he turned 32 years old 5 years ago, so we can add 32 and 5 to get his current age: Tom's current age = 32 + 5 = 37 Next, we need to figure out how old Jim was 7 years ago. We know that 7 years ago, Jim was 5 years older than half of Tom's age. Half of Tom's age is: 37 / 2 = 18.5 So 7 years ago, Jim was: 18.5 + 5 = 23.5 Now we need to find Jim's current age. We know that 7 years have passed since we calculated Jim's age, so we need to add 7 to his age: Jim's current age = 23.5 + 7 = 30.5 Finally, we need to find Jim's age in 2 years. We can simply add 2 to his current age: Jim's age in 2 years = 30.5 + 2 = 32.5 Therefore, Jim will be 32.5 years old in 2 years. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: 9 years from now, John will be 3 times as old as he was 11 years ago. How old is he now?\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume John's current age is x. 11 years ago, John's age was x - 11. 9 years from now, John's age will be x + 9. According to the problem, 9 years from now, John will be 3 times as old as he was 11 years ago. So, we can write the equation: x + 9 = 3(x - 11) Now, we can solve for x: x + 9 = 3x - 33 42 = 2x x = 21 Therefore, John is currently 21 years old. The answer is 21.\n\n\nQ: Karina was born in 1970 and she is currently twice as old as her brother. If her current age is 40, in what year was her brother born?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Karina's current age is 40. We also know that she is currently twice as old as her brother. Therefore, we can set up an equation: 40 = 2x where x is her brother's current age. Solving for x, we get: x = 20 So Karina's brother is currently 20 years old. Next, we need to figure out in what year he was born. We know that Karina was born in 1970, so we can subtract her brother's age from that year: 1970 - 20 = 1950 Therefore, Karina's brother was born in 1950. The answer is 1950.\n\n\nQ: James writes a comic every other day for 4 years. If there was no leap year, how many comics has he written?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days there are in 4 years. Since there are 365 days in a year, we can multiply 365 by 4 to get: 365 x 4 = 1460 days Next, we need to figure out how many comics James writes in every other day. Since he writes a comic every other day, we can divide the total number of days by 2 to get: 1460 / 2 = 730 comics Therefore, James has written 730 comics in 4 years if there was no leap year. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Ivan has 20 dice. Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. How many dice do they have altogether?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Ivan has 20 dice. Next, we know that Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. So, we can multiply Ivan's number of dice by 2 to find Jerry's number of dice: 20 x 2 = 40 Therefore, Jerry has 40 dice. To find the total number of dice they have altogether, we can add Ivan's and Jerry's number of dice: 20 + 40 = 60 Therefore, they have 60 dice altogether. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Jim has 2 rows of 4 trees to start.  When he turns 10 he decides to plant a new row of trees every year on his birthday.  On his 15th birthday after he doubles the number of trees he has.  How many trees does he have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller steps. Step 1: Jim starts with 2 rows of 4 trees each, so he has a total of 2 x 4 = 8 trees. Step 2: Jim plants a new row of trees every year on his birthday, starting from his 10th birthday. So, he plants trees for 15 - 10 = 5 years. Step 3: In these 5 years, Jim plants 5 new rows of trees, one row each year. Step 4: Therefore, Jim now has a total of 2 + 5 = 7 rows of trees. Step 5: Each row has 4 trees, so Jim has a total of 7 x 4 = 28 trees. Step 6: On his 15th birthday, Jim doubles the number of trees he has. So, he now has 28 x 2 = 56 trees. Therefore, Jim has 56 trees after he doubles the number of trees he has on his 15th birthday. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Marion received 20 more turtles than Martha at the animal rescue center where they had gone to take part in the animal saving day event. If Martha received 40 turtles, how many turtles did they receive together?\nA: Let's think step by step. Martha received 40 turtles. Marion received 20 more turtles than Martha, which means Marion received 40 + 20 = 60 turtles. To find out how many turtles they received together, we need to add Martha's turtles to Marion's turtles: 40 + 60 = 100. Therefore, they received 100 turtles together. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: John has 10 members of his family on his father's side.  His mother's side is 30% larger.  How many people are there in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to find out how many people are on John's mother's side. We know that it is 30% larger than his father's side, so we can calculate: 30% of 10 = 0.3 x 10 = 3 This means that John has 3 more family members on his mother's side than on his father's side. So, the total number of family members on his mother's side is: 10 + 3 = 13 Now, we can add up the number of family members on both sides to find the total: 10 + 13 = 23 Therefore, there are 23 people in John's family in total. The answer is 23.\n\n\n"
