  "test_question": "Q: Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. How old was Bill when he saw the Comet for the first time?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: James writes a comic every other day for 4 years. If there was no leap year, how many comics has he written?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days there are in 4 years. Since there are 365 days in a year, we can multiply 365 by 4 to get: 365 x 4 = 1460 days Next, we need to figure out how many comics James writes in every other day. Since he writes a comic every other day, we can divide the total number of days by 2 to get: 1460 / 2 = 730 comics Therefore, James has written 730 comics in 4 years if there was no leap year. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Tony decided he wanted to be an astronaut.  He went to college for 4 years to get a degree in science.  He then went on to get 2 more degrees in other fields for the same period of time.  He also got a graduate degree in physics, which took another 2 years.  How many years in total did Tony go to school to be an astronaut?\nA: Let's think step by step. Tony went to college for 4 years to get a degree in science. Then he went on to get 2 more degrees in other fields for the same period of time, which is another 4 years. He also got a graduate degree in physics, which took another 2 years. So in total, Tony went to school for 4 + 4 + 2 = 10 years to be an astronaut. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: 9 years from now, John will be 3 times as old as he was 11 years ago. How old is he now?\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume John's current age is x. 11 years ago, John's age was x - 11. 9 years from now, John's age will be x + 9. According to the problem, 9 years from now, John will be 3 times as old as he was 11 years ago. So, we can write the equation: x + 9 = 3(x - 11) Now, we can solve for x: x + 9 = 3x - 33 42 = 2x x = 21 Therefore, John is currently 21 years old. The answer is 21.\n\n\nQ: Tom turned 32 years old 5 years ago.  7 years ago Jim was 5 years older than half Tom's age.  How old is Jim in 2 years?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find Tom's current age. We know that he turned 32 years old 5 years ago, so we can add 32 and 5 to get his current age: Tom's current age = 32 + 5 = 37 Next, we need to figure out how old Jim was 7 years ago. We know that 7 years ago, Jim was 5 years older than half of Tom's age. Half of Tom's age is: 37 / 2 = 18.5 So 7 years ago, Jim was: 18.5 + 5 = 23.5 Now we need to find Jim's current age. We know that 7 years have passed since we calculated Jim's age, so we need to add 7 to his age: Jim's current age = 23.5 + 7 = 30.5 Finally, we need to find Jim's age in 2 years. We can simply add 2 to his current age: Jim's age in 2 years = 30.5 + 2 = 32.5 Therefore, Jim will be 32.5 years old in 2 years. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: John takes a pill every 6 hours.  How many pills does he take a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 24 hours in a day, so John takes 24/6 = 4 pills per day. In a week, there are 7 days, so John takes 4 x 7 = 28 pills per week. The answer is 28.\n\n\nQ: A big box store sees 175 people enter their store every hour.  This number doubles during the holiday season.  During the holiday season, how many customers will this big box store see in 8 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers the store sees in one hour during the holiday season. To do this, we can double the number of customers the store sees in a regular hour: 175 x 2 = 350 So during the holiday season, the store sees 350 customers per hour. Next, we need to find out how many customers the store will see in 8 hours during the holiday season. To do this, we can multiply the number of customers per hour by the number of hours: 350 x 8 = 2800 Therefore, during the holiday season, the big box store will see 2800 customers in 8 hours. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: To get to an island called \"Virgo\", Tom needs to travel by plane and then by boat. The plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, and the boat trip takes up to 2 hours. In how many hours is Tom able to get to the \"Virgo\" island?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long the plane trip is. We know that the plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, so we can set up an equation: plane trip = 4 * boat trip Since we know the boat trip takes 2 hours, we can substitute that in: plane trip = 4 * 2 plane trip = 8 So the plane trip is 8 hours. Now we just need to add the plane trip and the boat trip together to find the total time: total time = plane trip + boat trip total time = 8 + 2 total time = 10 So Tom is able to get to the \"Virgo\" island in 10 hours. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Tropical Storm Sally brings 3 days of rain to southern Texas.  The first day it rained 4 inches.  The second day it rained 5 times as much as the first day, and the third day it rained 6 inches less than the sum of the first two days.  How much did it rain on the third day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First day: 4 inches Second day: 5 times as much as the first day = 5 x 4 = 20 inches Third day: 6 inches less than the sum of the first two days = (4 + 20) - 6 = 18 inches Therefore, it rained 18 inches on the third day. The answer is 18.\n\n\n"
