  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of 18 watermelons. Since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, the total weight of 18 watermelons would be: 23 x 18 = 414 pounds Next, we need to find the total amount of money Farmer Kent would make by selling these watermelons. Since he sells them for $2 a pound, we can multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 414 x $2 = $828 Therefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Hammond carves life-sized statues out of marble. His latest set of four statues started with an 80-pound block of marble. The first statue he carved weighed 10 pounds. The second statue weighed 18. The remaining two statues weighed the same amount. The marble he discarded after carving it off the statues weighed 22 pounds. How much did each of the remaining statues Hammond carved weigh?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total weight of the first two statues. The first statue weighed 10 pounds and the second statue weighed 18 pounds, so the total weight of the first two statues is 10 + 18 = 28 pounds. Step 2: Find the weight of the discarded marble. The discarded marble weighed 22 pounds. Step 3: Find the weight of the remaining marble. The weight of the remaining marble is the difference between the weight of the original block of marble and the weight of the discarded marble. So, the weight of the remaining marble is 80 - 22 = 58 pounds. Step 4: Find the weight of each of the remaining statues. The remaining two statues weighed the same amount, so we can divide the weight of the remaining marble by 2 to find the weight of each statue. 58 / 2 = 29 pounds. Therefore, each of the remaining statues Hammond carved weighed 29 pounds. The answer is 29.\n\n\nQ: James has a small tree outside his window with 30 branches with 90 twigs per branch. 30% of the twigs sprout 4 leaves and the rest sprout 5 leaves. How many leaves are on the tree total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of twigs on the tree. We know that there are 30 branches with 90 twigs per branch, so: 30 branches x 90 twigs per branch = 2700 twigs Next, we need to find how many twigs sprout 4 leaves and how many sprout 5 leaves. We know that 30% of the twigs sprout 4 leaves, so: 30% of 2700 twigs = 0.3 x 2700 = 810 twigs sprout 4 leaves The remaining twigs sprout 5 leaves: 2700 twigs - 810 twigs = 1890 twigs sprout 5 leaves Now we can find the total number of leaves on the tree. Each twig that sprouts 4 leaves contributes 4 leaves, and each twig that sprouts 5 leaves contributes 5 leaves. So: 810 twigs x 4 leaves per twig = 3240 leaves from twigs that sprout 4 leaves 1890 twigs x 5 leaves per twig = 9450 leaves from twigs that sprout 5 leaves The total number of leaves on the tree is: 3240 leaves + 9450 leaves = 12690 leaves Therefore, there are 12690 leaves on the tree in total. The answer is 12690.\n\n\nQ: John carves a giant marble rectangular prism 8 meters tall with a 2-meter square base.  It has a density of 2700 kg per cubic meter.  How much does it weigh?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the volume of the rectangular prism. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is V = l x w x h, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height. In this case, we know that the height is 8 meters and the base is 2 meters square, so the length and width must also be 2 meters each. Therefore, the volume of the rectangular prism is: V = 2 x 2 x 8 = 32 cubic meters Next, we need to find the weight of the rectangular prism. We know that the density of the marble is 2700 kg per cubic meter, so we can use the formula: weight = density x volume Substituting the values we know, we get: weight = 2700 x 32 = 86,400 kg Therefore, the giant marble rectangular prism weighs 86,400 kg. The answer is 86400.\n\n\nQ: Paul has five dogs. For every 10 pounds they weigh, they need 1 pound of dog food per day. One weighs 20 pounds. One weighs 40. Another weighs 10. One weighs 30 and the final one weighs 50 pounds. How much dog food does he need each day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total weight of all five dogs. Total weight = 20 + 40 + 10 + 30 + 50 = 150 pounds Next, we need to calculate how much dog food is needed per day for every 10 pounds of weight. 1 pound of dog food is needed for every 10 pounds of weight So, for 150 pounds of weight, we need: 150/10 = 15 pounds of dog food per day Therefore, Paul needs 15 pounds of dog food each day to feed his five dogs. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: John chops down 30 trees.  From each tree, he can make 25 planks.  A table takes 15 planks to make and sells for $300.  He paid $3000 for all the labor.  How much profit did he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many planks John can make in total. 30 trees x 25 planks per tree = 750 planks Next, we need to figure out how many tables John can make with those planks. 750 planks / 15 planks per table = 50 tables Now we can calculate John's revenue from selling those tables. 50 tables x $300 per table = $15,000 Finally, we need to subtract the cost of labor to find John's profit. $15,000 - $3,000 = $12,000 Therefore, John made a profit of $12,000. The answer is 12000.\n\n\nQ: There are four growing trees. The first tree grows 1 meter/day, the second grows the same amount in half the time, the third grows 2 meters/day, and the fourth tree grows a meter more than the third each day. How many meters did the trees grow in total in 4 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much the second tree grows per day. Since it grows the same amount as the first tree in half the time, it grows 2 meters/day. Now we can calculate how much each tree grows in 4 days: - The first tree grows 1 meter/day, so in 4 days it grows 4 meters. - The second tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The third tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The fourth tree grows 1 meter more than the third each day, so it grows 3 meters/day. In 4 days it grows 12 meters. Adding up the growth of all four trees, we get: 4 + 8 + 8 + 12 = 32 meters Therefore, the trees grew a total of 32 meters in 4 days. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Stephen made 10 round trips up and down a 40,000 foot tall mountain. If he reached 3/4 of the mountain's height on each of his trips, calculate the total distance he covered.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much of the mountain Stephen climbed on each trip. If he reached 3/4 of the mountain's height on each trip, we can calculate this by multiplying the mountain's height by 3/4: 3/4 * 40,000 = 30,000 feet So Stephen climbed 30,000 feet on each trip. Since he made 10 round trips, we can multiply this by 20 to find out how much he climbed in total: 30,000 * 20 = 600,000 feet Therefore, Stephen covered a total distance of 600,000 feet. The answer is 600000.\n\n\n"
