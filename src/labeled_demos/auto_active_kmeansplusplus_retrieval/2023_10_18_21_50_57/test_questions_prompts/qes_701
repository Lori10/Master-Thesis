  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Sarah wants to start a cupcake business and was approved for a business loan.  The loan has 0% interest if she pays the entire amount back in 5 years, which she decides to do.  If she put $10,000 down as a down payment and her monthly payments are $600.00, how much was her loan for (including the down payment)?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total number of months in 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 5 years would be 5 x 12 = 60 months. Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money Sarah will pay in monthly payments. She will pay $600 per month for 60 months, so the total amount of money she will pay is 600 x 60 = $36,000. Now, we can calculate the total cost of the loan, including the down payment. Sarah put $10,000 down, and she will pay $36,000 in monthly payments, so the total cost of the loan is $10,000 + $36,000 = $46,000. Therefore, Sarah's loan was for $46,000 (including the down payment). The answer is 46000.\n\n\nQ: Logan makes $65,000 a year. He spends $20,000 on rent every year, $5000 on groceries every year, and $8000 on gas every year. If he wants to have at least $42000 left, how much more money must he make each year?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how much Logan spends in total each year: $20,000 (rent) + $5,000 (groceries) + $8,000 (gas) = $33,000 Next, we need to subtract that amount from his annual income: $65,000 (income) - $33,000 (expenses) = $32,000 So Logan currently has $32,000 left after paying his expenses. However, he wants to have at least $42,000 left. Therefore, we need to calculate how much more money he needs to make each year: $42,000 (desired savings) - $32,000 (current savings) = $10,000 Therefore, Logan needs to make at least $10,000 more each year to reach his desired savings goal. The answer is 10000.\n\n\nQ: Jerry works as an independent contractor for a company that pays him $40 per task. If each task takes him two hours to complete and he works 10 hours a day for a whole week, calculate the total amount of money he would earn at the end of the week.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many tasks Jerry can complete in a day. Since each task takes him two hours to complete, he can complete 10/2 = 5 tasks in a day. Next, we need to find out how many tasks Jerry can complete in a week. Since he works 10 hours a day for a whole week, he works a total of 10*7 = 70 hours in a week. Therefore, he can complete 70/2 = 35 tasks in a week. Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money Jerry would earn at the end of the week. Since he earns $40 per task, he would earn a total of 40*35 = $1400 at the end of the week. The answer is 1400.\n\n\nQ: Tony decided he wanted to be an astronaut.  He went to college for 4 years to get a degree in science.  He then went on to get 2 more degrees in other fields for the same period of time.  He also got a graduate degree in physics, which took another 2 years.  How many years in total did Tony go to school to be an astronaut?\nA: Let's think step by step. Tony went to college for 4 years to get a degree in science. Then he went on to get 2 more degrees in other fields for the same period of time, which is another 4 years. He also got a graduate degree in physics, which took another 2 years. So in total, Tony went to school for 4 + 4 + 2 = 10 years to be an astronaut. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Steve makes 40000$ a year as a teacher.  He loses 20 percent to taxes, 10 percent to healthcare, and 800$ to local union dues.  How much money does Steve take home?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Steve loses to taxes. To do this, we can multiply his salary by the tax rate as a decimal: 20% as a decimal is 0.20 Tax = 40000 x 0.20 = 8000$ Next, we need to find out how much money Steve loses to healthcare. We can use the same method as above: 10% as a decimal is 0.10 Healthcare = 40000 x 0.10 = 4000$ Now we need to subtract the taxes, healthcare, and union dues from Steve's salary to find out how much money he takes home: Take home pay = 40000 - 8000 - 4000 - 800 = 27200$ Therefore, Steve takes home 27200$ after taxes, healthcare, and union dues are deducted from his salary. The answer is 27200.\n\n\nQ: Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how much money Carl will earn in four weeks. If he earns $0.50 every time, and he buys a candy bar each time, that means he's spending $0.50 each week. But he's also earning $0.75 each week for taking out his neighbor's trash. So his net earnings each week are $0.75 - $0.50 = $0.25. Over four weeks, that's a total of $0.25 x 4 = $1. So Carl will have $1 to spend on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.50, he can buy 2 candy bars with his earnings. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Jim buys a wedding ring for $10,000.  He gets his wife a ring that is twice that much and sells the first one for half its value.  How much is he out of pocket?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Jim buys a wedding ring for $10,000. Next, we know that he gets his wife a ring that is twice that much, which means he spends $20,000 on her ring. Now, he sells the first ring for half its value, which means he sells it for $5,000. To find out how much Jim is out of pocket, we need to add up all of his expenses and subtract any income he received from selling the first ring. So, Jim's total expenses are $10,000 + $20,000 = $30,000. His income from selling the first ring is $5,000. Therefore, Jim is out of pocket $30,000 - $5,000 = $25,000. The answer is 25000.\n\n\nQ: Yoque borrowed money from her sister. She promised to pay it back in 11 months including an additional 10% of the money she borrowed. If she pays $15 per month, how much money did she borrow?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Yoque borrowed some amount of money from her sister. Let's call this amount \"x\". Next, we know that Yoque promised to pay back the money in 11 months, and that this includes an additional 10% of the money she borrowed. This means that Yoque will pay back the original amount she borrowed (x) plus 10% of that amount (0.1x). So the total amount Yoque will pay back is: x + 0.1x = 1.1x Finally, we know that Yoque will pay back this total amount over 11 months, at a rate of $15 per month. So we can set up an equation: 1.1x / 11 = 15 To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 11: 1.1x = 165 And then divide both sides by 1.1: x = 150 So Yoque borrowed $150 from her sister. The answer is 150.\n\n\n"
