  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Forty percent of the students have elected to learn from home during the pandemic. The remaining students are divided into two equal groups, only one of which is physically in school on any day. What percent of students are present in school?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Let's assume that there are 100 students in total. Step 2: 40% of the students have elected to learn from home during the pandemic. So, the number of students learning from home is 40% of 100, which is 40. Step 3: The remaining students are 60 (100 - 40). Step 4: The remaining students are divided into two equal groups, so each group has 30 students. Step 5: Only one of the two groups is physically in school on any day. So, the number of students present in school is 30. Step 6: To find the percentage of students present in school, we need to divide the number of students present in school by the total number of students and multiply by 100. 30/100 x 100 = 30% Therefore, 30% of students are present in school. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: Two-thirds of the class have brown eyes. Half of the students with brown eyes have black hair. If there are 6 students in the class with brown eyes and black hair, how many students are there in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that two-thirds of the class have brown eyes. Let's represent the total number of students in the class as \"x\". Then, we can write: (2/3)x = number of students with brown eyes Next, we know that half of the students with brown eyes have black hair. So, we can take half of the number of students with brown eyes to find the number of students with both brown eyes and black hair: (1/2)(2/3)x = 6 Simplifying this equation, we get: (1/3)x = 6 Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: x = 18 Therefore, there are 18 students in total. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: There are 13 3-year-olds, 20 4-year-olds, 15 5-year-olds, and 22 six-year-olds at a particular Sunday school. If the 3 and 4-year-olds are in one class and the 5 and 6-year-olds are in another class, what is the average class size?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of students in each class. For the 3 and 4-year-olds class, we add the number of 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds: 13 + 20 = 33 For the 5 and 6-year-olds class, we add the number of 5-year-olds and 6-year-olds: 15 + 22 = 37 Next, we need to find the average class size. To do this, we add the total number of students in both classes and divide by the number of classes: (33 + 37) / 2 = 35 Therefore, the average class size is 35 students. The answer is 35.\n\n\nQ: Aliya and her classmates are sent by their teacher to the field to collect insects for science class study. The Boys collected 200 insects and the girls collected 300 insects. The teacher decided to divide the class equally into four groups that each get an equal number of insects so that each group could study together. What was the number of insects given to each group?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of insects collected by the class. Total number of insects = 200 (boys) + 300 (girls) = 500 Step 2: Divide the total number of insects by the number of groups. Number of insects per group = 500 \u00f7 4 = 125 Step 3: Therefore, each group will get 125 insects to study. The answer is 125.\n\n\nQ: Aimee does a poll around her neighborhood and makes sure to get answers from 50% men and 50% women. She finds that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. How many people did she poll?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Aimee polled an equal number of men and women. Therefore, we can assume that 50% of the total number of people she polled are women. Let's call the total number of people she polled \"x\". Then, the number of women she polled is 0.5x. Next, we know that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. Therefore, the number of women in favor of this idea is 0.35(0.5x) = 0.175x. We also know that 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. Therefore, the number of women who did not support shortening the school day is 39. We can set up an equation to solve for x: 0.175x + 39 = 0.5x Simplifying this equation, we get: 39 = 0.325x x = 120 Therefore, Aimee polled 120 people in total. The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: A teacher is making packed lunches for a field trip. Each student needs 2 sandwiches, and will travel in a group with 5 other students. There are a total of 5 groups. How many pieces of bread will the teacher need to make enough sandwiches for all the students?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of students going on the field trip. Since each group has 6 students (1 student + 5 others), and there are 5 groups, the total number of students is: 6 students/group x 5 groups = 30 students Step 2: Find the total number of sandwiches needed. Since each student needs 2 sandwiches, the total number of sandwiches needed is: 2 sandwiches/student x 30 students = 60 sandwiches Step 3: Find the total number of bread slices needed. Since each sandwich has 2 slices of bread, the total number of bread slices needed is: 2 slices/sandwich x 60 sandwiches = 120 slices of bread Therefore, the teacher will need 120 slices of bread to make enough sandwiches for all the students. The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many students are in Alice's class. We know that there are 40 students and 10 instructors, so the total number of people in the class is 40 + 10 = 50. Next, we need to figure out how many students are bringing their own life vests. We know that 20% of the students are bringing life vests, so we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of students by 0.2: 40 x 0.2 = 8. So 8 students are bringing their own life vests. Now we need to figure out how many life vests we still need. We have 20 life vests on hand, and we need one for each of the 50 people in the class. So we need 50 - 20 = 30 more life vests. However, we already know that 8 students are bringing their own life vests, so we can subtract those from the total number we need: 30 - 8 = 22. Therefore, Alice needs to get 22 more life vests so that the entire class has one. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Frankie and Carla played 30 games of ping pong against each other.  Frankie won half as many games as did Carla.  How many games did Carla win?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can start by using algebra to represent the problem. Let's say that Carla won x number of games. Then, we know that Frankie won half as many games as Carla, which means Frankie won (1/2)x games. Next, we know that they played a total of 30 games, so we can set up an equation: x + (1/2)x = 30 We can simplify this equation by combining like terms: (3/2)x = 30 To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/2, which is 2/3: x = (2/3) * 30 x = 20 Therefore, Carla won 20 games. The answer is 20.\n\n\n"
