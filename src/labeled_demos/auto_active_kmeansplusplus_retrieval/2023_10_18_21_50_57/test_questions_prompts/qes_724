  "formatted_prompt": "Q: May can knit 3 scarves using one yarn. She bought 2 red yarns, 6 blue yarns, and 4 yellow yarns. How many scarves will she be able to make in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. May can knit 3 scarves using one yarn. So, with 2 red yarns, she can knit 2 x 3 = 6 red scarves. With 6 blue yarns, she can knit 6 x 3 = 18 blue scarves. And with 4 yellow yarns, she can knit 4 x 3 = 12 yellow scarves. Therefore, in total, May will be able to make 6 + 18 + 12 = 36 scarves. The answer is 36.\n\n\nQ: Betsy is sewing a quilt.  The quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side.  Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together.  How many more squares does she need to sew together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many squares Betsy has already sewn together. If the quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side, then the total number of squares in the quilt is: 16 x 16 = 256 squares If Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together, then she has sewn: 0.25 x 256 = 64 squares Now we need to find out how many more squares she needs to sew together. To do this, we can subtract the number of squares she has already sewn from the total number of squares in the quilt: 256 - 64 = 192 squares So Betsy still needs to sew together 192 squares to complete the quilt. The answer is 192.\n\n\nQ: Norma takes her clothes to the laundry. She leaves 9 T-shirts and twice as many sweaters as T-shirts in the washer. When she returns she finds 3 sweaters and triple the number of T-shirts. How many items are missing?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Norma left 9 T-shirts in the washer. Next, we know that she left twice as many sweaters as T-shirts in the washer. So, she left 2 x 9 = 18 sweaters in the washer. When she returns, she finds 3 sweaters and triple the number of T-shirts. So, she finds 3 sweaters + 3 x 9 = 30 T-shirts. To find out how many items are missing, we need to add up the total number of items that Norma left in the washer and subtract the total number of items that she found when she returned. Total items left in washer: 9 T-shirts + 18 sweaters = 27 items Total items found when she returned: 3 sweaters + 30 T-shirts = 33 items So, the number of items missing is: 33 - 27 = 6 items. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Kendra made 4 more than five times as many decorated buttons as Mari. Sue made half as many as Kendra. Mari made 8 buttons. How many did Sue make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many buttons Kendra made. We know that Kendra made 4 more than five times as many decorated buttons as Mari, and Mari made 8 buttons. So, we can write an equation: Kendra's buttons = 4 + 5 x Mari's buttons Kendra's buttons = 4 + 5 x 8 Kendra's buttons = 44 Therefore, Kendra made 44 buttons. Next, we need to find out how many buttons Sue made. We know that Sue made half as many as Kendra, so we can write another equation: Sue's buttons = 1/2 x Kendra's buttons Sue's buttons = 1/2 x 44 Sue's buttons = 22 Therefore, Sue made 22 buttons. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Debra is the host of a country music radio show, and she broadcasts interviews with celebrity country music singers. Each week, she interviews three singers, one at a time.  The first interview segment is always twice as long as the other two segments combined, and the third interview segment is always half as long as the second. If the third segment is 10 minutes long, how many minutes long is the entire show?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the third interview segment is 10 minutes long and is half as long as the second segment. Therefore, the second segment is 20 minutes long (10 x 2 = 20). Next, we know that the first segment is twice as long as the other two segments combined. So, the total length of the second and third segments is 20 + 10 = 30 minutes. Therefore, the first segment is 60 minutes long (30 x 2 = 60). Finally, to find the total length of the show, we add up the lengths of all three segments: 60 + 20 + 10 = 90 minutes. Therefore, the entire show is 90 minutes long. The answer is 90.\n\n\nQ: Anna wants to plant red and yellow tulips in the shape of a smiley face. She needs 8 red tulips for each eye and 18 red tulips for the smile. If she needs 9 times the number of tulips in the smile to make the yellow background of the face, how many tulips does she need total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many red tulips Anna needs in total. She needs 8 red tulips for each eye, so for both eyes, she needs 8 x 2 = 16 red tulips. She also needs 18 red tulips for the smile. Therefore, she needs a total of 16 + 18 = 34 red tulips. Next, we need to figure out how many yellow tulips Anna needs. We know that she needs 9 times the number of tulips in the smile to make the yellow background of the face. Since she needs 18 red tulips for the smile, she needs 9 x 18 = 162 yellow tulips. Finally, we can add the number of red and yellow tulips together to find the total number of tulips Anna needs. She needs 34 red tulips and 162 yellow tulips, so she needs a total of 34 + 162 = 196 tulips in total. The answer is 196.\n\n\nQ: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Bertha started with two balls and gave one to her partner, so she has one ball left. Next, we need to figure out how many balls she loses and how many wear out. In 20 games, she loses 20/5 = 4 balls and 20/10 = 2 balls wear out. Finally, we need to figure out how many balls she buys. In 20 games, she buys 20/4 = 5 canisters of three balls, which is a total of 5*3 = 15 balls. So, in total, Bertha has 1 (starting ball) - 4 (lost balls) - 2 (worn out balls) + 15 (bought balls) = 10 tennis balls. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Mary has 26 blue shirts and 36 brown shirts. If she gives away half of her blue shirts and a third of her brown shirts, how many shirts does she have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many blue shirts Mary gives away. Half of her blue shirts would be: 26 / 2 = 13 So Mary gives away 13 blue shirts. Next, we need to find out how many brown shirts Mary gives away. A third of her brown shirts would be: 36 / 3 = 12 So Mary gives away 12 brown shirts. Now we can find out how many shirts Mary has left. She started with 26 blue shirts and gave away 13, so she has: 26 - 13 = 13 blue shirts left She started with 36 brown shirts and gave away 12, so she has: 36 - 12 = 24 brown shirts left Therefore, Mary has 13 + 24 = 37 shirts left. The answer is 37.\n\n\n"
