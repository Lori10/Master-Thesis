  "test_question": "Q: Chris has a two-speed lawn mower. He can mow his entire lawn in \"turtle\" mode in 1 hour, or 40 minutes in \"rabbit\" mode. Today, he experimented by mowing half in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode. How many minutes did it take him to mow the lawn?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Larry jogs for 30 minutes each day. In the first week, he jogs for 3 days while he jogs for 5 days in the second week. How many hours does he jog in total for two weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days Larry jogs in two weeks. Larry jogs for 3 days in the first week and 5 days in the second week, so he jogs for a total of 3 + 5 = 8 days in two weeks. Next, we need to find out how many hours Larry jogs in one day. Larry jogs for 30 minutes each day, which is equivalent to 0.5 hours. Finally, we can calculate how many hours Larry jogs in total for two weeks by multiplying the number of days by the number of hours per day: 8 days x 0.5 hours per day = 4 hours Therefore, Larry jogs for a total of 4 hours in two weeks. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: The white rabbit can hop 15 meters in one minute. The brown rabbit hops 12 meters per minute. What is the total distance the two rabbits will hop in 5 minutes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how far the white rabbit can hop in 5 minutes. To do this, we can multiply its speed by the time: 15 meters/minute x 5 minutes = 75 meters So the white rabbit can hop 75 meters in 5 minutes. Next, we need to find out how far the brown rabbit can hop in 5 minutes. Again, we can multiply its speed by the time: 12 meters/minute x 5 minutes = 60 meters So the brown rabbit can hop 60 meters in 5 minutes. To find the total distance the two rabbits will hop in 5 minutes, we simply add their distances: 75 meters + 60 meters = 135 meters Therefore, the two rabbits will hop a total distance of 135 meters in 5 minutes. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Larry spends half an hour twice a day walking and playing with his dog. He also spends a fifth of an hour every day feeding his dog. How many minutes does Larry spend on his dog each day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many minutes Larry spends walking and playing with his dog each day. Larry spends half an hour twice a day, so that's 0.5 x 2 = 1 hour per day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Larry spends 1 x 60 = 60 minutes per day walking and playing with his dog. Next, we need to find out how many minutes Larry spends feeding his dog each day. Larry spends a fifth of an hour feeding his dog, which is 0.2 hours. Again, since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Larry spends 0.2 x 60 = 12 minutes per day feeding his dog. Finally, we can add the time Larry spends walking and playing with his dog to the time he spends feeding his dog to find out how many minutes he spends on his dog each day. Larry spends 60 + 12 = 72 minutes on his dog each day. The answer is 72.\n\n\nQ: Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour. Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour.  Oliver can read 40 pages.  How many pages can Carter read in 1 hour?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Oliver can read 40 pages in 1 hour. Next, we know that Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour, so Lucy can read 40 + 20 = 60 pages in 1 hour. Finally, we know that Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour, so Carter can read 60 / 2 = 30 pages in 1 hour. Therefore, Carter can read 30 pages in 1 hour. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Carlos and Diego are racing around the block. Carlos runs around the entire block in 3 minutes. Diego runs around half the block in 2.5 minutes and then is tripped by a dog and can't finish. Assuming he kept up the same speed the entire race, what would've been the average time in seconds for the racers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Diego to run the entire block. Since he runs half the block in 2.5 minutes, we can use proportion to find out: 2.5 minutes = 1/2 block x minutes = 1 block Cross-multiplying, we get: 2.5 * 2 = x * 1 5 = x So it would take Diego 5 minutes to run the entire block if he hadn't been tripped. Now we can find the average time for the racers. We add up the time it took Carlos and the time it would've taken Diego, and divide by the number of racers: (3 minutes + 5 minutes) / 2 racers = 4 minutes But the question asks for the answer in seconds, so we need to convert minutes to seconds: 4 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 240 seconds So the average time for the racers would've been 240 seconds. The answer is 240.\n\n\nQ: Christina and her friend are driving across the state. When Christina is driving the speed limit is 30 miles per hour. When her friend is driving, the speed limit is 40 miles per hour. The drive is 210 miles total. If her friend drives for 3 hours and both drive at the speed limit, how many minutes will Christina drive?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long Christina's friend will drive for. We know that her friend will drive for 3 hours at 40 miles per hour, so we can use the formula: distance = rate x time to find out how far her friend will travel: distance = 40 x 3 = 120 miles Now we can subtract that distance from the total distance to find out how far Christina will drive: 210 - 120 = 90 miles We also know that Christina drives at 30 miles per hour, so we can use the formula again to find out how long she will drive for: time = distance / rate time = 90 / 30 = 3 hours But we need to convert that to minutes, so we can multiply by 60: time = 3 x 60 = 180 minutes So Christina will drive for 180 minutes. The answer is 180.\n\n\nQ: Stuart is going on a cross-country trip and wants to find the fastest route. On one route the total distance is 1500 miles and the average speed is 75 MPH. On the second trip, the total distance is 750 but the average speed is 25 MPH. How long does his trip take if he goes on the fastest route?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for Stuart to complete the first route. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed So for the first route, the time would be: time = 1500 / 75 time = 20 hours Next, we need to find the time it takes for Stuart to complete the second route: time = 750 / 25 time = 30 hours Now we know that the second route takes longer than the first route. So the fastest route would be the first route, which takes 20 hours. Therefore, if Stuart goes on the fastest route, his trip will take 20 hours. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: A train takes 4 hours to reach a destination at a speed of 50 miles per hour. How long would it take if it traveled at 100 miles per hour instead?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time We know that the distance is the same in both scenarios, so we can set the two equations equal to each other: 50 miles/hour x 4 hours = 100 miles/hour x time Simplifying this equation, we get: 200 miles = 100 miles/hour x time Dividing both sides by 100 miles/hour, we get: time = 2 hours Therefore, if the train traveled at 100 miles per hour instead of 50 miles per hour, it would take 2 hours to reach the destination. The answer is 2.\n\n\n"
