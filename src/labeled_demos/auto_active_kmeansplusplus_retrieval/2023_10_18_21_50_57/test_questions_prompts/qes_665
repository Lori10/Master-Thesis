  "test_question": "Q: Jennie is helping at her mom's office. She has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps, and a pile of letters already stamped.

  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Mary bought a packet of 1500 stickers. She shared them between Susan, Andrew and Sam in the ratio 1:1:3 respectively. If Sam gave Andrew two-thirds of his own share, how many stickers does Andrew now have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 1+1+3=5. Next, we need to find the size of each part by dividing the total number of stickers by the total number of parts: 1500/5=300. So, Susan and Andrew each get one part, which is 300 stickers each. Sam gets three parts, which is 900 stickers. Now, we need to find out how many stickers Sam gave to Andrew. Two-thirds of Sam's share is (2/3)*900=600. Therefore, Andrew now has 300+600=900 stickers. The answer is 900.\n\n\nQ: Every hour Joanne has to collect the coins out of the fountain inside the mall. During the first hour, she collected 15 coins. For the next two hours, she collected 35 coins from the fountain. In the fourth hour, she collected 50 coins from the fountain but she gave 15 of them to her coworker so she could buy a soda. How many coins did she have after the fourth hour?\nA: Let's think step by step. First hour: Joanne collected 15 coins. Second and third hour: Joanne collected 35 coins each, so she collected a total of 35+35=70 coins. Fourth hour: Joanne collected 50 coins but gave 15 to her coworker, so she kept 50-15=35 coins. To find out how many coins Joanne had after the fourth hour, we need to add up all the coins she collected and subtract the ones she gave away: 15 + 70 + 35 = 120 coins collected 120 - 15 = 105 coins after giving 15 to her coworker. Therefore, Joanne had 105 coins after the fourth hour. The answer is 105.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Stacy bought two packs of printer paper for the office. Each pack has 240 sheets of paper. Her office prints 80 one-page documents per day. How many days will the printer paper last her office?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many sheets of paper Stacy bought in total. Since she bought two packs, each with 240 sheets, we can multiply 2 by 240 to get: 2 x 240 = 480 So Stacy bought 480 sheets of paper in total. Next, we need to figure out how many pages her office prints per day. We know they print 80 one-page documents per day, so that means they print: 80 x 1 = 80 pages per day Now we can use this information to figure out how many days the paper will last. We can divide the total number of sheets by the number of pages printed per day: 480 / 80 = 6 So the printer paper will last Stacy's office 6 days. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Janice can type 6 sentences per minute. Today at work, Janice continued working on a paper she started typing yesterday. She typed for 20 minutes, took a break, and typed 15 minutes longer. She then had to erase 40 sentences she had typed incorrectly. After a meeting, she typed for 18 minutes more. In all, the paper had 536 sentences by the end of today. How many sentences did she start with today?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many sentences Janice typed in the first 20 minutes: 6 sentences/minute x 20 minutes = 120 sentences Next, let's find out how many sentences Janice typed in the additional 15 minutes: 6 sentences/minute x 15 minutes = 90 sentences Now, let's subtract the 40 sentences she had to erase: 120 sentences + 90 sentences - 40 sentences = 170 sentences So, Janice typed 170 sentences before the meeting. We know that the paper had 536 sentences by the end of the day, so we can subtract the 170 sentences Janice typed before the meeting to find out how many sentences she started with: 536 sentences - 170 sentences = 366 sentences Therefore, Janice started with 366 sentences today. The answer is 366.\n\n\nQ: Jenny wants to read 3 books in the next 10 days. She can read 100 words per hour. If the first book has 200 words, the second book has 400 words, and the third book has 300 words, how many minutes per day, on average, should she spend reading?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find the total number of words in all three books: 200 + 400 + 300 = 900 words Next, let's find the total number of hours it will take Jenny to read all three books: 900 words \u00f7 100 words per hour = 9 hours Now, let's find the average number of minutes per day that Jenny should spend reading: 9 hours \u00f7 10 days = 0.9 hours per day 0.9 hours per day x 60 minutes per hour = 54 minutes per day Therefore, Jenny should spend an average of 54 minutes per day reading to finish all three books in 10 days. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: There were 90 jellybeans in a jar. Samantha snuck 24 jellybeans out of the jar, without being seen. Shelby ate 12 jellybeans from the jar. Their mom, Shannon, refilled the jar with half as much as Samantha and Shelby took out. How many jellybeans are in the jar now?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Samantha took out 24 jellybeans from the jar. Step 2: Shelby ate 12 jellybeans from the jar. Step 3: The total number of jellybeans taken out of the jar is 24 + 12 = 36. Step 4: Shannon refilled the jar with half as much as Samantha and Shelby took out, which is 1/2 * 36 = 18 jellybeans. Step 5: The total number of jellybeans in the jar now is 90 - 36 + 18 = 72 jellybeans. Therefore, there are 72 jellybeans in the jar now. The answer is 72.\n\n\nQ: Mary has 26 blue shirts and 36 brown shirts. If she gives away half of her blue shirts and a third of her brown shirts, how many shirts does she have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many blue shirts Mary gives away. Half of her blue shirts would be: 26 / 2 = 13 So Mary gives away 13 blue shirts. Next, we need to find out how many brown shirts Mary gives away. A third of her brown shirts would be: 36 / 3 = 12 So Mary gives away 12 brown shirts. Now we can find out how many shirts Mary has left. She started with 26 blue shirts and gave away 13, so she has: 26 - 13 = 13 blue shirts left She started with 36 brown shirts and gave away 12, so she has: 36 - 12 = 24 brown shirts left Therefore, Mary has 13 + 24 = 37 shirts left. The answer is 37.\n\n\n"
