  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A department store offers a 10% discount for the amount exceeding $100 of the customer's total charge. Jaco bought a pair of shoes for $74; 2 pairs of socks that cost $2 per pair; a bag that costs $42. How much will Jaco pay for those items?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jaco bought: - Shoes: $74 - Socks: 2 pairs x $2 per pair = $4 - Bag: $42 Total cost = $74 + $4 + $42 = $120 Since the total cost exceeds $100, Jaco is eligible for a discount. The amount that exceeds $100 is $20 ($120 - $100). The discount is 10% of $20, which is $2. Therefore, Jaco will pay the total cost minus the discount: Total cost - discount = $120 - $2 = $118 Jaco will pay $118 for those items. The answer is 118.\n\n\nQ: To buy a book, you pay $20 for each of the first 5 books at the supermarket, and for each additional book you buy over $20, you receive a discount of $2. If Beatrice bought 20 books, how much did she pay at the supermarket?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the first 5 books, which is simply: $20 x 5 = $100 Next, we need to calculate the cost of the remaining 15 books. Since Beatrice gets a $2 discount for each book over $20, we can calculate the cost of each book as: $20 - $2 = $18 Therefore, the cost of the remaining 15 books is: $18 x 15 = $270 Finally, we can calculate the total cost by adding the cost of the first 5 books to the cost of the remaining 15 books: $100 + $270 = $370 Therefore, Beatrice paid $370 at the supermarket for 20 books. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Betty bought 1 kg of oranges and 3 kg of apples. The total cost of oranges was $12. The apples were two times cheaper than the oranges. How much did Betty pay for 1 kg of apples?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the total cost of oranges was $12. We don't know the cost per kilogram of oranges, but we can figure it out by dividing the total cost by the amount of oranges Betty bought: Cost per kilogram of oranges = $12 \u00f7 1 kg = $12/kg Next, we know that the apples were two times cheaper than the oranges. This means that the cost per kilogram of apples is half the cost per kilogram of oranges: Cost per kilogram of apples = 1/2 \u00d7 $12/kg = $6/kg Therefore, Betty paid $6 for 1 kg of apples. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Apples used to cost $1.6 per pound.  The price got raised 25%.  How much does it cost to buy 2 pounds of apples for each person in a 4 member family?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Calculate the new price of apples after the 25% increase. The price increase is 25% of $1.6, which is (25/100) x $1.6 = $0.4. So, the new price of apples is $1.6 + $0.4 = $2. Step 2: Calculate the cost of buying 2 pounds of apples for each person in the family. Since there are 4 members in the family, we need to buy 2 x 4 = 8 pounds of apples in total. The cost of buying 1 pound of apples is $2, so the cost of buying 8 pounds of apples is 8 x $2 = $16. Therefore, it would cost $16 to buy 2 pounds of apples for each person in a 4 member family. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Ella has 4 bags with 20 apples in each bag and six bags with 25 apples in each bag. If Ella sells 200 apples, how many apples does Ella has left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many apples Ella has in total. She has 4 bags with 20 apples in each bag, so that's 4 x 20 = 80 apples. She also has 6 bags with 25 apples in each bag, so that's 6 x 25 = 150 apples. In total, Ella has 80 + 150 = 230 apples. If she sells 200 apples, we can subtract that from the total: 230 - 200 = 30 Therefore, Ella has 30 apples left. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: A bag of dozen apples costs $14 and Brian has already spent $10 on kiwis and half that much on bananas. What's the maximum number of apples Brian can buy if he left his house with only $50 and needs to pay the $3.50 subway fare each way?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much money Brian has left after paying for the subway fare. He needs to pay $3.50 each way, so that's a total of $7 for the round trip. Therefore, he has $50 - $7 = $43 left to spend on groceries. Next, we need to figure out how much money Brian has already spent on bananas. We know he spent half as much on bananas as he did on kiwis, and he spent $10 on kiwis. So he spent $10 / 2 = $5 on bananas. Now we can subtract the amount Brian has already spent on kiwis and bananas from the total amount he has left to spend on groceries: $43 - $10 - $5 = $28. Finally, we need to figure out how many bags of apples Brian can buy with $28. We know that one bag of apples costs $14, so we can divide $28 by $14 to get the maximum number of bags of apples Brian can buy: $28 / $14 = 2. Therefore, the maximum number of bags of apples Brian can buy is 2. Since each bag contains a dozen apples, he can buy a total of 2 x 12 = 24 apples. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: One kilogram of tomatoes is 20% cheaper than one kilogram of cucumbers. One kilogram of cucumbers costs $5. What is the price of two kilograms of tomatoes and three kilograms of cucumbers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the price of one kilogram of tomatoes. We know that it is 20% cheaper than one kilogram of cucumbers, which costs $5. 20% of $5 is $1, so one kilogram of tomatoes costs $5 - $1 = $4. Next, we need to find the price of two kilograms of tomatoes. Two kilograms of tomatoes would cost 2 x $4 = $8. Finally, we need to find the price of three kilograms of cucumbers. Three kilograms of cucumbers would cost 3 x $5 = $15. Therefore, the total price of two kilograms of tomatoes and three kilograms of cucumbers is $8 + $15 = $23. The answer is 23.\n\n\nQ: Bart buys $10 of notepads for $1.25 each.  They have 60 pages each.  How many pages did he buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many notepads Bart bought. We can do this by dividing the total amount he spent by the cost of each notepad: $10 \u00f7 $1.25 = 8 notepads Next, we need to find out how many pages are in each notepad and multiply that by the number of notepads: 60 pages/notepad x 8 notepads = 480 pages Therefore, Bart bought 480 pages of notepads. The answer is 480.\n\n\n"
