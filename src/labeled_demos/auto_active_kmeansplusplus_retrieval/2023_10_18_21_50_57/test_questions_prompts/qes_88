  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Gwen received a $900 bonus at work and decided to invest this money in the stock market.  She spent one-third of her bonus on stock A, one-third on stock B, and the remaining one-third on stock C.   After one year, stock A and stock B had doubled in value, while stock C had lost half of its value.  At the end of the year, how much were Gwen's stocks worth, in dollars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Gwen spent on each stock. Since she spent one-third of her bonus on each stock, we can calculate: - Stock A: 1/3 x $900 = $300 - Stock B: 1/3 x $900 = $300 - Stock C: 1/3 x $900 = $300 Next, we need to calculate the value of each stock after one year: - Stock A: $300 x 2 = $600 - Stock B: $300 x 2 = $600 - Stock C: $300 / 2 = $150 Finally, we can add up the value of all three stocks to find out how much Gwen's stocks are worth after one year: - Total value = $600 + $600 + $150 = $1,350 Therefore, Gwen's stocks are worth $1,350 after one year. The answer is 1350.\n\n\nQ: Marco has $24. Mary has $15. If Marco gives Mary half of what he has, Mary will have more than Marco. But Mary spends $5. How much more money does Mary have than Marco?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much money Marco gives to Mary. Since Marco has $24, half of that would be $12. So, Marco gives $12 to Mary. After receiving $12 from Marco, Mary will have $15 + $12 = $27. However, Mary spends $5, so we need to subtract that from her total. $27 - $5 = $22. Therefore, Mary has $22 more than Marco. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Maria's birthday is in 22 days. Her friend Lilly wants to buy her flowers so she saves $2 each day until Maria's birthday. If a flower costs $4, how many flowers can she buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Lilly will have saved up by Maria's birthday. Lilly saves $2 each day for 22 days, so she will have saved: $2/day x 22 days = $44 Now we need to figure out how many flowers Lilly can buy with $44. Each flower costs $4, so we can divide the total amount of money Lilly has saved by the cost of each flower: $44 \u00f7 $4/flower = 11 flowers Therefore, Lilly can buy 11 flowers for Maria's birthday. The answer is 11.\n\n\nQ: Maria's monthly salary is $2000. 20% of her salary goes to paying tax, and 5% goes to insurance. Also, a quarter of the money left after the deductions is spent on utility bills. How much money does Maria have after the deductions and utility bills payment?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money goes to tax and insurance. Tax: 20% of $2000 = 0.2 x $2000 = $400 Insurance: 5% of $2000 = 0.05 x $2000 = $100 Next, we need to subtract the total amount of tax and insurance from Maria's monthly salary to find out how much money she has left. $2000 - $400 - $100 = $1500 Now, we need to find out how much money Maria spends on utility bills. A quarter of $1500 = 0.25 x $1500 = $375 Finally, we need to subtract the amount spent on utility bills from the money Maria has left after the deductions. $1500 - $375 = $1125 Therefore, Maria has $1125 left after the deductions and utility bills payment. The answer is 1125.\n\n\nQ: John buys 500 newspapers.  Each newspaper sells for $2.  He sells 80% of them.  He buys them all for 75% less than the price at which he sells them.  How much profit does he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much John buys the newspapers for. He buys them for 75% less than the price at which he sells them, which means he buys them for 25% of the selling price. 25% of the selling price = 0.25 x 2 = $0.50 So, John buys each newspaper for $0.50. Next, let's calculate how much John earns from selling the newspapers. He sells 80% of the 500 newspapers, which is: 0.8 x 500 = 400 newspapers He sells each newspaper for $2, so his total earnings are: 400 x 2 = $800 Now, let's calculate how much John spent on buying the newspapers: 500 x 0.50 = $250 Therefore, John's profit is: $800 - $250 = $550 So, John makes a profit of $550. The answer is 550.\n\n\nQ: On Friday, Hank opened his used-bicycle store with a stock of bicycles, all fixed-up and ready to ride. Over the course of the day, he sold 10 bicycles and bought an additional 15 to fix up. On Saturday, he sold 12 bicycles and bought 8 more. And on Sunday, he sold 9 bicycles and bought 11 more. What was the net increase in the number of bicycles in stock in Hank's store over the three days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On Friday, Hank sold 10 bicycles and bought 15 more, so the net increase in the number of bicycles in stock was 15 - 10 = 5. On Saturday, he sold 12 bicycles and bought 8 more, so the net decrease in the number of bicycles in stock was 12 - 8 = 4. On Sunday, he sold 9 bicycles and bought 11 more, so the net increase in the number of bicycles in stock was 11 - 9 = 2. To find the overall net increase in the number of bicycles in stock over the three days, we need to add up the net increases and net decreases: Net increase on Friday = 5 Net decrease on Saturday = -4 Net increase on Sunday = 2 Overall net increase = 5 - 4 + 2 = 3 Therefore, the net increase in the number of bicycles in stock in Hank's store over the three days was 3. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Maria wants to paint a picture and needs some tools to do that. She wants to buy a set of brushes for $20 and some canvas for three times more than the brushes. The paint costs Maria $8 per liter, and she needs at least 5 liters. How much money will she earn on the painting if she will be able to sell it for $200?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much Maria will spend on canvas. We know that the canvas will cost three times more than the brushes, which are $20. So, 3 x $20 = $60 for the canvas. Next, let's calculate how much Maria will spend on paint. She needs at least 5 liters, and each liter costs $8. So, 5 x $8 = $40 for the paint. Now, let's add up all of Maria's expenses: $20 for brushes + $60 for canvas + $40 for paint = $120 total expenses. If Maria sells the painting for $200, she will earn $200 - $120 = $80 profit. The answer is 80.\n\n\nQ: Marcus wants to buy a new pair of shoes. He decided to pay not more than $130 for them. He found a pair for $120, on which he got a discount of 30%. How much money will he manage to save by buying these shoes and not spending the assumed maximum amount?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the discount Marcus got on the shoes. Discount = 30% of $120 = 0.3 x $120 = $36 This means Marcus paid $120 - $36 = $84 for the shoes. Now we can calculate how much money he saved by buying these shoes instead of spending the maximum amount of $130. Savings = $130 - $84 = $46 Therefore, Marcus managed to save $46 by buying these shoes and not spending the assumed maximum amount. The answer is 46.\n\n\n"
