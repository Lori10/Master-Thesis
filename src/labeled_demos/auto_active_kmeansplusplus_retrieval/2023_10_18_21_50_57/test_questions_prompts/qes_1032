  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Monica way studying for an exam. She studied for 2 hours on Wednesday and three times as long on Thursday. On Friday Monica studied half of the time she studied on Thursday. During the weekend (two days) Monica studied as much again as Wednesday, Thursday and Friday combined. How much time did she spend studying in total during the five days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On Wednesday, Monica studied for 2 hours. On Thursday, she studied three times as long as Wednesday, which means she studied for 2 x 3 = 6 hours. On Friday, she studied half of the time she studied on Thursday, which means she studied for 6 / 2 = 3 hours. The total time Monica studied from Wednesday to Friday is 2 + 6 + 3 = 11 hours. During the weekend, Monica studied as much again as Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday combined, which means she studied for 11 x 2 = 22 hours. Therefore, Monica spent a total of 11 + 22 = 33 hours studying during the five days. The answer is 33.\n\n\nQ: For homework, Brooke has 15 math problems, 6 social studies problems, and 10 science problems. He can answer each math problem for 2 minutes while answering each social studies problem takes him 30 seconds. If he can answer each science problem in 1.5 minutes, how long will it take Brooke to answer all his homework?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total time Brooke needs to answer all the math problems: 15 math problems x 2 minutes per problem = 30 minutes Next, let's calculate the total time Brooke needs to answer all the social studies problems: 6 social studies problems x 30 seconds per problem = 3 minutes Note that we converted the time to minutes since the time for math problems is given in minutes. Finally, let's calculate the total time Brooke needs to answer all the science problems: 10 science problems x 1.5 minutes per problem = 15 minutes Now, we can add up the time for each subject to get the total time Brooke needs to answer all his homework: 30 minutes (math) + 3 minutes (social studies) + 15 minutes (science) = 48 minutes Therefore, it will take Brooke 48 minutes to answer all his homework. The answer is 48.\n\n\nQ: Jenny wants to read 3 books in the next 10 days. She can read 100 words per hour. If the first book has 200 words, the second book has 400 words, and the third book has 300 words, how many minutes per day, on average, should she spend reading?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find the total number of words in all three books: 200 + 400 + 300 = 900 words Next, let's find the total number of hours it will take Jenny to read all three books: 900 words \u00f7 100 words per hour = 9 hours Now, let's find the average number of minutes per day that Jenny should spend reading: 9 hours \u00f7 10 days = 0.9 hours per day 0.9 hours per day x 60 minutes per hour = 54 minutes per day Therefore, Jenny should spend an average of 54 minutes per day reading to finish all three books in 10 days. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Billy has 8 hours of free time on each day of the weekend. He wants to spend 75% of his time playing video games and the rest of his time reading. He can read 60 pages an hour and his books all contain 80 pages. How many books does he read?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts. First, we need to find out how much time Billy spends playing video games and how much time he spends reading. He has 8 hours of free time on each day of the weekend, so that's a total of 16 hours for the entire weekend. If he wants to spend 75% of his time playing video games, that means he will spend 0.75 x 16 = 12 hours playing video games. The rest of his time will be spent reading, which is 16 - 12 = 4 hours. Next, we need to find out how many pages he can read in 1 hour. We know that he can read 60 pages an hour, so that's 60 pages/hour. Finally, we need to find out how many books he can read in 4 hours. Each book contains 80 pages, so he can read 60/80 = 0.75 of a book in 1 hour. In 4 hours, he can read 4 x 0.75 = 3 books. Therefore, Billy can read 3 books during his free time on the weekend. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour. Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour.  Oliver can read 40 pages.  How many pages can Carter read in 1 hour?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Oliver can read 40 pages in 1 hour. Next, we know that Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour, so Lucy can read 40 + 20 = 60 pages in 1 hour. Finally, we know that Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour, so Carter can read 60 / 2 = 30 pages in 1 hour. Therefore, Carter can read 30 pages in 1 hour. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Peter and Kristin are to read 20 fantasy novels each in a week. Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin. If Peter reads one book in 18 hours, how long will Kristin read half of her books?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Peter to read one book. We know that he can read one book in 18 hours, so we can write: Peter's reading speed = 1 book / 18 hours Next, we need to find out how long it takes Kristin to read one book. We know that Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin, so we can write: Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * Peter's reading speed Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * (1 book / 18 hours) Kristin's reading speed = 1 book / 54 hours Now we can use Kristin's reading speed to find out how long it takes her to read half of her books. We know that she needs to read 20 books in a week, so she needs to read 10 books in half a week (3.5 days). We can write: Time to read 10 books = 10 books * (1 book / 54 hours) * (24 hours / 1 day) * (3.5 days) Time to read 10 books = 14 hours and 27 minutes Therefore, it will take Kristin 14 hours and 27 minutes to read half of her books. The answer is 27.\n\n\nQ: Ayen jogs for 30 minutes every day during weekdays. This week on Tuesday, she jogged 5 minutes more and also jogged 25 minutes more on Friday. How many hours, in total, did Ayen jog this week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long Ayen jogged on each weekday. She jogs for 30 minutes every day during weekdays, so from Monday to Thursday, she jogged for a total of 30 x 4 = 120 minutes. On Tuesday, she jogged 5 minutes more, so she jogged for 30 + 5 = 35 minutes. On Friday, she jogged 25 minutes more, so she jogged for 30 + 25 = 55 minutes. Therefore, Ayen jogged for a total of 120 + 35 + 55 = 210 minutes this week. To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 210 \u00f7 60 = 3.5 hours So Ayen jogged for a total of 3.5 hours this week. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Betty and Dora started making some cupcakes at the same time. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour and Dora makes 8 every hour. If Betty took a two-hour break, what is the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Betty made in the first 3 hours before taking a break. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour, so in 3 hours, she would make: 10 cupcakes/hour x 3 hours = 30 cupcakes Next, we need to find out how many cupcakes Dora made in the same 5 hours. Dora makes 8 cupcakes every hour, so in 5 hours, she would make: 8 cupcakes/hour x 5 hours = 40 cupcakes Now we need to find the difference between the number of cupcakes they made. Betty made 30 cupcakes before taking a break, and Dora made 40 cupcakes in the same 5 hours. So the difference between the number of cupcakes they made is: 40 cupcakes - 30 cupcakes = 10 cupcakes Therefore, the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours is 10 cupcakes. The answer is 10.\n\n\n"
