  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A flower shop sells bouquets of roses, which each contain 12 roses, and bouquets of daisies, which each contain an equal amount of daisies. The flower shop sells 20 bouquets today. 10 of these were rose bouquets and the remaining 10 bouquets were daisy bouquets. If the flower shop has sold 190 flowers in total today, how many daisies are in each bouquet of daisies?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the flower shop sold 10 bouquets of roses, each containing 12 roses, so they sold a total of 10 x 12 = 120 roses. Next, we know that the flower shop sold 10 bouquets of daisies, and we want to find out how many daisies are in each bouquet. Let's call the number of daisies in each bouquet \"d\". So, the flower shop sold a total of 10 x d = 10d daisies. We also know that the flower shop sold a total of 190 flowers in total today, so: 120 (roses) + 10d (daisies) = 190 Simplifying this equation, we get: 10d = 70 Dividing both sides by 10, we get: d = 7 Therefore, each bouquet of daisies contains 7 daisies. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Dane\u2019s two daughters need to plant 5 flowers each to grow a garden. As the days passed, the flowers grew into 20 more but 10 of them died. Dane\u2019s daughters harvested the flowers and split them between 5 different baskets. How many flowers ended up in each basket?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many flowers were in the garden before the 20 grew and 10 died. Dane's two daughters planted 5 flowers each, so they planted a total of 2 x 5 = 10 flowers. After the flowers grew, there were 10 + 20 = 30 flowers in the garden. But then 10 of them died, so there were 30 - 10 = 20 flowers left. Finally, the 20 flowers were split between 5 baskets, so each basket had 20 / 5 = 4 flowers. Therefore, each basket ended up with 4 flowers. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Trevor buys three bouquets of carnations. The first included 9 carnations, and the second included 14 carnations. If the average number of carnations in the bouquets is 12, how many carnations were in the third bouquet?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of carnations in the first two bouquets. Total number of carnations in the first two bouquets = 9 + 14 = 23 Next, we can use the formula for finding the average: Average = (Total sum of items) / (Number of items) We know that the average number of carnations in the three bouquets is 12, and we already found the total number of carnations in the first two bouquets. So we can set up an equation: 12 = (23 + x) / 3 where x is the number of carnations in the third bouquet. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 36 = 23 + x Subtracting 23 from both sides, we get: x = 13 Therefore, there were 13 carnations in the third bouquet. The answer is 13.\n\n\nQ: James and 4 of his friends volunteered to plant flowers. In 2 days, they were able to plant a total of 200 flowers. If each of them planted the same number of flowers, how many flowers did James plant in a day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people were planting flowers. We know that James and 4 of his friends volunteered, so there were 5 people in total. Next, we need to find out how many flowers each person planted in 2 days. To do this, we can divide the total number of flowers planted (200) by the number of people (5) and the number of days (2): 200 \u00f7 5 \u00f7 2 = 20 So each person planted 20 flowers in 2 days. Finally, we need to find out how many flowers James planted in 1 day. Since each person planted 20 flowers in 2 days, we can divide that by 2 to find out how many flowers each person planted in 1 day: 20 \u00f7 2 = 10 Therefore, James planted 10 flowers in 1 day. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Jezebel needs to buy two dozens of red roses and 3 pieces of sunflowers for a bouquet that she is going to arrange. Each red rose costs $1.50 and each sunflower costs $3. How much will Jezebel pay for all those flowers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine how many flowers Jezebel needs to buy. Two dozens of red roses mean 2 x 12 = 24 red roses. She also needs 3 sunflowers. So, in total, she needs 24 + 3 = 27 flowers. Next, we need to calculate the cost of the red roses. Each red rose costs $1.50, so 24 red roses will cost 24 x $1.50 = $36. Then, we need to calculate the cost of the sunflowers. Each sunflower costs $3, so 3 sunflowers will cost 3 x $3 = $9. Finally, we add the cost of the red roses and the sunflowers to get the total cost. $36 + $9 = $45. Therefore, Jezebel will pay $45 for all those flowers. The answer is 45.\n\n\nQ: Anna wants to plant red and yellow tulips in the shape of a smiley face. She needs 8 red tulips for each eye and 18 red tulips for the smile. If she needs 9 times the number of tulips in the smile to make the yellow background of the face, how many tulips does she need total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many red tulips Anna needs in total. She needs 8 red tulips for each eye, so for both eyes, she needs 8 x 2 = 16 red tulips. She also needs 18 red tulips for the smile. Therefore, she needs a total of 16 + 18 = 34 red tulips. Next, we need to figure out how many yellow tulips Anna needs. We know that she needs 9 times the number of tulips in the smile to make the yellow background of the face. Since she needs 18 red tulips for the smile, she needs 9 x 18 = 162 yellow tulips. Finally, we can add the number of red and yellow tulips together to find the total number of tulips Anna needs. She needs 34 red tulips and 162 yellow tulips, so she needs a total of 34 + 162 = 196 tulips in total. The answer is 196.\n\n\nQ: June made a design with 20 equal tiles. Three tiles are yellow and the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles. Six tiles are purple and the remaining tiles are white.  How many white tiles are there?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 3 yellow tiles. Next, we know that the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles, so there are 3+1=4 blue tiles. Then, we know that there are 6 purple tiles. So far, we have accounted for 3+4+6=13 tiles. Since there are 20 tiles in total, we can subtract 13 from 20 to find the number of white tiles: 20-13=7 Therefore, there are 7 white tiles in June's design. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\n"
