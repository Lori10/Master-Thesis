  "test_question": "Q: John makes himself a 6 egg omelet with 2 oz of cheese and an equal amount of ham.  Eggs are 75 calories each.  Cheese is 120 calories per ounce.  Ham is 40 calories per ounce.  How many calories is the omelet?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Marie, the confectioner, makes 12 chocolate eggs, each weighing 10 ounces. She then packs an equal number of the eggs in 4 different gift boxes. Unfortunately, she leaves one of the boxes by the kitchen window and the afternoon sun melts everything. She tosses that box out. What is the total weight, in ounces, of the remaining chocolate eggs?\nA: Let's think step by step. Marie makes 12 chocolate eggs, each weighing 10 ounces. So the total weight of all the eggs is: 12 x 10 = 120 ounces Marie packs an equal number of eggs in 4 different gift boxes. So each box contains: 120 / 4 = 30 ounces But one of the boxes is tossed out, so we need to subtract the weight of that box from the total weight of the eggs. Therefore, the total weight of the remaining chocolate eggs is: (3 boxes) x (30 ounces per box) = 90 ounces The answer is 90.\n\n\nQ: James takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces.  He splits the pieces between 4 people.  If an orange has 80 calories how many calories does each person get?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pieces James has in total. He takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces, so he has 5 x 8 = 40 pieces in total. Next, we need to divide the pieces between 4 people. To do this, we can divide the total number of pieces by 4: 40 \u00f7 4 = 10 pieces per person. Finally, we need to find out how many calories each person gets. We know that one orange has 80 calories, so each piece has 80 \u00f7 8 = 10 calories. Therefore, each person gets 10 x 10 = 100 calories. So each person gets 100 calories. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Dante needs half as many cups of flour to bake his chocolate cake as he needs eggs. If he uses 60 eggs in his recipe, calculate the total number of cups of flour and eggs that he uses altogether.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cups of flour Dante needs. We know that he needs half as many cups of flour as he needs eggs. So, if he needs 60 eggs, he needs half as many cups of flour, which is 60/2 = 30 cups of flour. Next, we need to calculate the total number of cups of flour and eggs that Dante uses altogether. Dante uses 60 eggs and 30 cups of flour, so the total number of cups of flour and eggs that he uses altogether is 60 + 30 = 90. Therefore, Dante uses a total of 90 cups of flour and eggs altogether in his recipe. The answer is 90.\n\n\nQ: Brandon can catch 6 squirrels or two rabbits in 1 hour. Each squirrel has 300 calories and each rabbit has 800 calories. How many more calories will he get per hour if he catches squirrels instead of rabbits?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many calories Brandon can get from catching squirrels in one hour. We know that each squirrel has 300 calories, and he can catch 6 squirrels in one hour. So, the total number of calories he can get from catching squirrels in one hour is: 300 calories/squirrel x 6 squirrels = 1800 calories Next, we need to find out how many calories Brandon can get from catching rabbits in one hour. We know that each rabbit has 800 calories, and he can catch 2 rabbits in one hour. So, the total number of calories he can get from catching rabbits in one hour is: 800 calories/rabbit x 2 rabbits = 1600 calories Finally, we need to find out how many more calories Brandon will get per hour if he catches squirrels instead of rabbits. We can do this by subtracting the number of calories he can get from catching rabbits from the number of calories he can get from catching squirrels: 1800 calories - 1600 calories = 200 calories Therefore, Brandon will get 200 more calories per hour if he catches squirrels instead of rabbits. The answer is 200.\n\n\nQ: Francis and Kiera had breakfast at a cafe. Muffins cost $2 each, and fruit cups cost $3 each. Francis had 2 muffins and 2 fruit cups. Kiera had 2 muffins and 1 fruit cup. How much did their breakfast cost?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the cost of Francis's breakfast. 2 muffins cost 2 x $2 = $4 2 fruit cups cost 2 x $3 = $6 So Francis's breakfast cost $4 + $6 = $10 Now let's calculate the cost of Kiera's breakfast. 2 muffins cost 2 x $2 = $4 1 fruit cup costs $3 So Kiera's breakfast cost $4 + $3 = $7 Finally, let's add the cost of Francis's and Kiera's breakfast to find the total cost. $10 + $7 = $17 Therefore, their breakfast cost $17 in total. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Phoebe has two pizzas to share with her and three friends. One has pepperoni and the other has cheese. They both have 16 slices. They all eat the same amount. One friend eats only pepperoni, while the rest have an equal number of slices of each. At the end, there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese, how many slices does each person eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 2 pizzas with 16 slices each, so there are a total of 32 slices. Next, we know that one friend only eats pepperoni, so they eat one slice from the pepperoni pizza. That leaves 31 slices, with 15 slices from each pizza. We also know that there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese left. So, the remaining 15 slices are divided equally among the remaining 3 friends, which means each of them eats 5 slices. Therefore, each person eats 1 slice of pepperoni and 5 slices of cheese. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Shane prepares sandwiches for the Boy Scouts. He buys 2 packages of sliced bread containing 20 slices each, and he also buys 2 packages of sliced ham containing 8 slices each. Shane will make as many sandwiches as he can according to the ham he has. How many slices of bread will he have leftover?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of ham Shane has in total. 2 packages of sliced ham containing 8 slices each = 2 x 8 = 16 slices of ham Now, we know that Shane will make as many sandwiches as he can according to the ham he has. Since each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread, we can calculate the maximum number of sandwiches he can make: 16 slices of ham / 2 slices of bread per sandwich = 8 sandwiches So, Shane will make 8 sandwiches. Each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread, so he will use: 8 sandwiches x 2 slices of bread per sandwich = 16 slices of bread Shane has 2 packages of sliced bread containing 20 slices each, so he has: 2 packages x 20 slices per package = 40 slices of bread Therefore, he will have: 40 slices of bread - 16 slices of bread used = 24 slices of bread leftover. So, Shane will have 24 slices of bread leftover. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: John drinks 2 energy drinks. 1 of them is a 12-ounce drink with 250 grams of caffeine.  The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce but only 2 ounces.  He then takes a caffeine pill that has as much caffeine as his 2 drinks combined.  How much caffeine did he consume?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much caffeine is in the 12-ounce energy drink. We know that it has 250 grams of caffeine, so we can convert that to ounces by dividing by 28.35 (the number of grams in an ounce): 250 / 28.35 = 8.82 ounces of caffeine in the 12-ounce drink Next, we need to find out how much caffeine is in the second energy drink. We know that it is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce than the first drink, so we can multiply the caffeine per ounce in the first drink (8.82 / 12 = 0.735 ounces per ounce) by 3: 0.735 * 3 = 2.205 ounces per ounce in the second drink Since the second drink is only 2 ounces, we can multiply the caffeine per ounce by 2 to find out how much caffeine is in the second drink: 2.205 * 2 = 4.41 ounces of caffeine in the second drink Now we can add up the caffeine in both drinks: 8.82 + 4.41 = 13.23 ounces of caffeine in both drinks Finally, we need to add the caffeine in the caffeine pill. We know that the pill has as much caffeine as both drinks combined, so we can add 13.23 ounces to itself: 13.23 + 13.23 = 26.46 ounces of caffeine in total Therefore, John consumed 26.46 ounces of caffeine in total. The answer is 26.\n\n\n"
