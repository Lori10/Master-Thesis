  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A math teacher had $100 to buy three different types of calculators. A basic calculator costs $8. A scientific calculator costs twice the price as the basic while a graphing calculator costs thrice the price as the scientific. How much change did she receive after buying those three different types of calculators?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many calculators of each type the teacher can buy with $100. Let's start with the basic calculator. Each basic calculator costs $8, so the teacher can buy 100/8 = 12.5 basic calculators. Since we can't buy half a calculator, we'll round down to 12 basic calculators. Next, let's figure out how many scientific calculators the teacher can buy. Each scientific calculator costs twice as much as a basic calculator, so it costs $8 x 2 = $16. With $100, the teacher can buy 100/16 = 6.25 scientific calculators. Again, we'll round down to 6 scientific calculators. Finally, let's figure out how many graphing calculators the teacher can buy. Each graphing calculator costs three times as much as a scientific calculator, so it costs $16 x 3 = $48. With $100, the teacher can buy 100/48 = 2.08 graphing calculators. We'll round down to 2 graphing calculators. So in total, the teacher can buy 12 basic calculators, 6 scientific calculators, and 2 graphing calculators. The cost of the basic calculators is 12 x $8 = $96. The cost of the scientific calculators is 6 x $16 = $96. The cost of the graphing calculators is 2 x $48 = $96. So the total cost of all the calculators is $96 + $96 + $96 = $288. The teacher started with $100, so she received $100 - $288 = -$188 in change. However, since she didn't have enough money to buy all the calculators she wanted, she actually owes $188. The answer is 188.\n\n\nQ: Whitney\u2019s mom gave her two $20 bills to spend at the school book fair. Whitney has decided to buy 2 posters, 3 notebooks, and 2 bookmarks. Each poster costs $5, each notebook costs $4, and each bookmark costs $2. How much money, in dollars, will Whitney have left over after the purchase?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of the posters. Whitney is buying 2 posters, and each poster costs $5, so the total cost of the posters is 2 x $5 = $10. Next, let's calculate the total cost of the notebooks. Whitney is buying 3 notebooks, and each notebook costs $4, so the total cost of the notebooks is 3 x $4 = $12. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the bookmarks. Whitney is buying 2 bookmarks, and each bookmark costs $2, so the total cost of the bookmarks is 2 x $2 = $4. Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Whitney is buying: $10 + $12 + $4 = $26. Whitney started with two $20 bills, which is a total of $40. After spending $26 on the posters, notebooks, and bookmarks, she will have $40 - $26 = $14 left over. Therefore, Whitney will have $14 left over after the purchase. The answer is 14.\n\n\nQ: Bart buys $10 of notepads for $1.25 each.  They have 60 pages each.  How many pages did he buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many notepads Bart bought. We can do this by dividing the total amount he spent by the cost of each notepad: $10 \u00f7 $1.25 = 8 notepads Next, we need to find out how many pages are in each notepad and multiply that by the number of notepads: 60 pages/notepad x 8 notepads = 480 pages Therefore, Bart bought 480 pages of notepads. The answer is 480.\n\n\nQ: Francis and Kiera had breakfast at a cafe. Muffins cost $2 each, and fruit cups cost $3 each. Francis had 2 muffins and 2 fruit cups. Kiera had 2 muffins and 1 fruit cup. How much did their breakfast cost?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the cost of Francis's breakfast. 2 muffins cost 2 x $2 = $4 2 fruit cups cost 2 x $3 = $6 So Francis's breakfast cost $4 + $6 = $10 Now let's calculate the cost of Kiera's breakfast. 2 muffins cost 2 x $2 = $4 1 fruit cup costs $3 So Kiera's breakfast cost $4 + $3 = $7 Finally, let's add the cost of Francis's and Kiera's breakfast to find the total cost. $10 + $7 = $17 Therefore, their breakfast cost $17 in total. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Tickets to the school play cost $6 for students and $8 for adults. If 20 students and 12 adults bought tickets, how many dollars' worth of tickets were sold?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Determine the number of students and adults who bought tickets. Given that 20 students and 12 adults bought tickets. Step 2: Determine the cost of tickets for students and adults. Tickets for students cost $6 and tickets for adults cost $8. Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money made from ticket sales. To calculate the total amount of money made from ticket sales, we need to multiply the number of students by the cost of a student ticket and the number of adults by the cost of an adult ticket, then add the two products together. Total amount of money made = (20 x $6) + (12 x $8) Total amount of money made = $120 + $96 Total amount of money made = $216 Therefore, $216 worth of tickets were sold. The answer is 216.\n\n\nQ: Hanna has twice as many erasers as Rachel.  Rachel has three less than one-half as many erasers as Tanya has red erasers.  If Tanya has 20 erasers, and half of them are red, how many erasers does Hanna have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red erasers Tanya has. We know that half of her erasers are red, so: 20/2 = 10 red erasers Next, we need to figure out how many erasers Rachel has. We know that Rachel has three less than one-half as many erasers as Tanya has red erasers, so: (1/2) * 20 - 3 = 7 erasers Finally, we need to find out how many erasers Hanna has, since we know she has twice as many as Rachel. Therefore: 2 * 7 = 14 erasers So, Hanna has 14 erasers. The answer is 14.\n\n\nQ: Oliver had $9, then he saved $5 from his allowance and spent $4 on a frisbee and $3 on a puzzle. His friend gives him another $8 as it's his birthday. How much money does Oliver have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. Oliver had $9. He saved $5 from his allowance, so he now has $9 + $5 = $14. He spent $4 on a frisbee, so he now has $14 - $4 = $10. He spent another $3 on a puzzle, so he now has $10 - $3 = $7. His friend gives him another $8, so he now has $7 + $8 = $15. Therefore, Oliver has $15 left. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: There are four lamps in Valerie's room. All of them are burnt out, so she needs to buy new light bulbs. She needs 3 small light bulbs and 1 large light bulb. She has $60 to spend. If small light bulbs cost $8 and large light bulbs cost $12, how much money will Valerie have left over?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total cost of the light bulbs Valerie needs to buy. The cost of 3 small light bulbs is: 3 x $8 = $24 The cost of 1 large light bulb is: 1 x $12 = $12 So the total cost is: $24 + $12 = $36 Next, we need to subtract the total cost from the amount of money Valerie has: $60 - $36 = $24 Therefore, Valerie will have $24 left over after buying the light bulbs. The answer is 24.\n\n\n"
