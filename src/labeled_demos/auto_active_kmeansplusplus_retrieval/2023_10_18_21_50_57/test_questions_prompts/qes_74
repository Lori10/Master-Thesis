  "test_question": "Q: There are 10000 gallons of water in a pool. Using a water pump, Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool. They use water from the tank to water their vegetable garden. If the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day, how many gallons of water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Timmy, Tommy and Tina are filling up a kiddie pool in their backyard.  Each has a pail they fill with water from a house before dumping it into the pool.  If Timmy's pail holds twice as much water as Tommy's, and Tommy's holds 2 gallons more than Tina's, and Tina's is 4 gallons, how much water do the three of them fill the pool with after 3 trips each?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much water each pail can hold. We know that Tina's pail holds 4 gallons. Tommy's pail holds 2 more gallons than Tina's, so it holds 4 + 2 = 6 gallons. Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's, so it holds 6 x 2 = 12 gallons. Now we know how much water each pail can hold, we can figure out how much water they can fill the pool with after 1 trip each. Together, they can fill the pool with 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 gallons of water. After 3 trips each, they will have filled the pool with 22 x 3 = 66 gallons of water. The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: John takes a 10-minute shower every other day for 4 weeks. If his shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute.  How much water does he use in those 4 weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many showers John takes in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks is 4 x 7 = 28 days. Since John takes a shower every other day, he takes 28/2 = 14 showers in 4 weeks. Next, we need to find out how much water he uses per shower. John takes a 10-minute shower, and his shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute. So, he uses 10 x 2 = 20 gallons of water per shower. Finally, we can find out how much water he uses in 4 weeks by multiplying the amount of water per shower by the number of showers he takes: 20 gallons per shower x 14 showers = 280 gallons of water in 4 weeks. Therefore, John uses 280 gallons of water in those 4 weeks. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: A water tower that serves four neighborhoods around it holds 1200 barrels of water and is filled to the top each week. If one neighborhood uses 150 barrels of water in a week, the second neighborhood uses twice as many barrels of water as the first neighborhood in a week, and the third neighborhood uses one hundred more barrels of water than the second neighborhood in a week, how many barrels are left for the fourth neighborhood?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many barrels of water the second neighborhood uses in a week. We know that the first neighborhood uses 150 barrels, so the second neighborhood uses twice as many, which is 150 x 2 = 300 barrels. Next, we need to find out how many barrels of water the third neighborhood uses in a week. We know that the third neighborhood uses 100 more barrels than the second neighborhood, so that's 300 + 100 = 400 barrels. Now, we can add up the barrels of water used by the first three neighborhoods: 150 + 300 + 400 = 850 barrels. We know that the water tower holds 1200 barrels of water and is filled to the top each week, so to find out how many barrels are left for the fourth neighborhood, we can subtract the barrels used by the first three neighborhoods from the total capacity of the water tower: 1200 - 850 = 350 barrels. Therefore, the fourth neighborhood has 350 barrels of water left for the week. The answer is 350.\n\n\nQ: John has a very inefficient toilet that uses 5 gallons of water per flush and his household flushed 15 times per day.  He replaced it with a toilet that uses 80% less water per flush.  How much water did John save in June?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much water John's old toilet used per day: 5 gallons/flush x 15 flushes/day = 75 gallons/day Next, let's calculate how much water John's new toilet uses per flush: 5 gallons/flush x 80% = 4 gallons/flush So, John's new toilet uses 4 gallons per flush. Now, let's calculate how much water John's new toilet uses per day: 4 gallons/flush x 15 flushes/day = 60 gallons/day Finally, let's calculate how much water John saved in June (assuming 30 days in June): Water saved per day = 75 gallons/day - 60 gallons/day = 15 gallons/day Water saved in June = 15 gallons/day x 30 days = 450 gallons Therefore, John saved 450 gallons of water in June by replacing his old toilet with a new, more efficient one. The answer is 450.\n\n\nQ: A vampire needs to suck 7 gallons of blood per week to survive.  If he sucks 2 pints of blood per person, how many people does he need to suck each day to survive?\nA: Let's think step by step. 1 gallon = 8 pints (since 1 gallon = 128 fluid ounces and 1 fluid ounce = 0.125 pints) So, 7 gallons = 7 x 8 = 56 pints The vampire needs to suck 56 pints of blood per week to survive. 2 pints of blood per person To find out how many people the vampire needs to suck each day, we need to divide 56 by the number of days in a week (7). 56/7 = 8 Therefore, the vampire needs to suck blood from 8 people each day to survive. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Mark is filling a punch bowl that can hold 16 gallons of punch. He fills it part way, then his cousin comes along and drinks half the punch in the bowl. Mark starts to refill the bowl and adds 4 more gallons, but then his friend Sally comes in and drinks 2 more gallons of punch. After that, Mark has to add 12 gallons of punch to completely fill the bowl. How much punch did Mark initially add to the bowl?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Mark fills the punch bowl part way, but we don't know how much he added yet. Let's call this amount \"x\". Then, his cousin drinks half the punch in the bowl, which means there is now only 8 gallons of punch left in the bowl. Mark starts to refill the bowl and adds 4 more gallons, so there are now 12 gallons of punch in the bowl. But then Sally comes in and drinks 2 more gallons of punch, so there are now only 10 gallons of punch in the bowl. Finally, Mark has to add 12 more gallons of punch to completely fill the bowl, which means the bowl can hold a total of 24 gallons of punch (16 gallons initially + 8 gallons left after cousin drank half). So, we can set up an equation to solve for x: x + 8 + 4 - 2 + 12 = 24 Simplifying, we get: x + 22 = 24 Subtracting 22 from both sides, we get: x = 2 Therefore, Mark initially added 2 gallons of punch to the bowl. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Claudia has 122 ounces of water and is filling up cups. She has 8-ounce glasses, 5-ounce glasses, and 4-ounce glasses. If she fills six 5 ounce glasses and four 8 ounce glasses, how many 4 ounce glasses can she fill with the remaining water?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much water Claudia has used so far. 6 x 5 = 30 ounces (for six 5-ounce glasses) 4 x 8 = 32 ounces (for four 8-ounce glasses) So, Claudia has used 30 + 32 = 62 ounces of water. Now, let's calculate how much water she has left. 122 - 62 = 60 ounces Finally, let's calculate how many 4-ounce glasses she can fill with the remaining water. 60 / 4 = 15 Therefore, Claudia can fill 15 4-ounce glasses with the remaining water. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Ivar owns a stable. He recently has 3 horses and each horse consumes 5 liters of water for drinking and 2 liters for bathing per day. If he added 5 horses, how many liters of water does Ivar need for all the horses for 28 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total amount of water consumed by one horse per day. Each horse consumes 5 liters of water for drinking and 2 liters for bathing per day, so the total amount of water consumed by one horse per day is 5 + 2 = 7 liters. Next, we need to calculate the total amount of water consumed by all the horses per day. Ivar has 3 horses, so the total amount of water consumed by all the horses per day is 3 x 7 = 21 liters. If he added 5 more horses, he would have a total of 3 + 5 = 8 horses. So, the total amount of water consumed by all the horses per day with 8 horses is 8 x 7 = 56 liters. Finally, we need to calculate the total amount of water needed for all the horses for 28 days. The total amount of water needed for all the horses for 28 days is 28 x 56 = 1,568 liters. Therefore, Ivar needs 1,568 liters of water for all the horses for 28 days. The answer is 28.\n\n\n"
