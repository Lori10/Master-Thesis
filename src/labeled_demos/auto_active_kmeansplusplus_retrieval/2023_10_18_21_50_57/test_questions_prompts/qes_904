  "test_question": "Q: A jellyfish tank has numerous jellyfish in it. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. How many jellyfish are in the tank?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: At the zoo, there are 5 different types of animals. Seeing each animal type takes around 6 minutes. How much time would it take to see each animal type if the zoo decided to import 4 new species?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many animal types there will be in total after the zoo imports 4 new species. 5 (original animal types) + 4 (new species) = 9 (total animal types) Next, we need to find out how long it takes to see each animal type. 6 minutes per animal type x 9 animal types = 54 minutes Therefore, it would take 54 minutes to see each animal type if the zoo decided to import 4 new species. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Andy is mixing blue, green and white paint in a 1 : 2 : 5 ratio. If he uses 6 gallons of green paint, how many gallons of paint does he use total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much paint Andy is using in total based on the ratio given. The ratio of blue : green : white paint is 1 : 2 : 5. This means that for every 1 gallon of blue paint, Andy uses 2 gallons of green paint and 5 gallons of white paint. Since we know that Andy is using 6 gallons of green paint, we can use this information to find out how much of the other colors he is using. 2 gallons of green paint is equivalent to 1 gallon of blue paint, so Andy is using 3 gallons of blue paint (since 6/2 = 3). 5 gallons of white paint is equivalent to 2.5 gallons of green paint, so Andy is using 30 gallons of white paint (since 6 x 5 = 30). Therefore, Andy is using a total of 6 + 3 + 30 = 39 gallons of paint. The answer is 39.\n\n\nQ: Melly's two cats each have litters of kittens at the same time. The first cat has 3 blue-eyed kittens and 7 brown-eyed kittens. The second cat has 4 blue-eyed kittens and 6 brown-eyed kittens. What percentage of all the kittens have blue eyes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of kittens. The first cat has 3 + 7 = 10 kittens. The second cat has 4 + 6 = 10 kittens. So, the total number of kittens is 10 + 10 = 20. Next, we need to find the total number of blue-eyed kittens. The first cat has 3 blue-eyed kittens. The second cat has 4 blue-eyed kittens. So, the total number of blue-eyed kittens is 3 + 4 = 7. To find the percentage of kittens with blue eyes, we need to divide the number of blue-eyed kittens by the total number of kittens and then multiply by 100. 7/20 x 100 = 35 Therefore, 35% of all the kittens have blue eyes. The answer is 35.\n\n\nQ: There were 90 jellybeans in a jar. Samantha snuck 24 jellybeans out of the jar, without being seen. Shelby ate 12 jellybeans from the jar. Their mom, Shannon, refilled the jar with half as much as Samantha and Shelby took out. How many jellybeans are in the jar now?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Samantha took out 24 jellybeans from the jar. Step 2: Shelby ate 12 jellybeans from the jar. Step 3: The total number of jellybeans taken out of the jar is 24 + 12 = 36. Step 4: Shannon refilled the jar with half as much as Samantha and Shelby took out, which is 1/2 * 36 = 18 jellybeans. Step 5: The total number of jellybeans in the jar now is 90 - 36 + 18 = 72 jellybeans. Therefore, there are 72 jellybeans in the jar now. The answer is 72.\n\n\nQ: Jerry is sweeping up pieces of broken glass in the parking lot. He sweeps up 20 amber pieces, 35 green pieces, and some clear pieces. If the green pieces are 25% of the total glass he sweeps up, how many pieces were clear?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the green pieces are 25% of the total glass, so we can set up an equation: 35 = 0.25x where x is the total number of pieces of glass Jerry sweeps up. We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.25: x = 140 So Jerry sweeps up a total of 140 pieces of glass. We also know that he sweeps up 20 amber pieces and 35 green pieces, so the number of clear pieces must be: 140 - 20 - 35 = 85 Therefore, Jerry swept up 85 clear pieces of glass. The answer is 85.\n\n\nQ: There are 5 green candies, 3 blue candies, and 4 red candies in a bag. If Violet randomly picks a candy from the bag, how likely is it that it's blue?\nA: Let's think step by step. There are a total of 5 + 3 + 4 = 12 candies in the bag. The probability of picking a blue candy is the number of blue candies divided by the total number of candies: P(blue) = 3/12 Simplifying this fraction, we get: P(blue) = 1/4 Therefore, the probability of picking a blue candy is 1/4 or 25%. The answer is 25.\n\n\nQ: Eric has 20 marbles. He has 12 white marbles, 6 blue marbles, and the rest are green marbles. How many green marbles does Eric have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Eric has a total of 20 marbles. Out of those 20 marbles, he has 12 white marbles and 6 blue marbles. To find out how many green marbles he has, we need to subtract the number of white and blue marbles from the total number of marbles: 20 - 12 - 6 = 2 Therefore, Eric has 2 green marbles. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Jaylen has 5 carrots and 2 cucumbers. Jaylen has twice as many bell peppers as Kristin. Jaylen has 3 less than half as many green beans as Kristin. If Kristin has 2 bell peppers and 20 green beans, how many vegetables does Jaylen have in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bell peppers Jaylen has. We know that Jaylen has twice as many bell peppers as Kristin, and Kristin has 2 bell peppers. So, Jaylen has 2 x 2 = 4 bell peppers. Next, we need to find out how many green beans Jaylen has. We know that Jaylen has 3 less than half as many green beans as Kristin, and Kristin has 20 green beans. So, half of 20 is 10, and 3 less than 10 is 7. Therefore, Jaylen has 7 green beans. Now, we can add up all the vegetables Jaylen has: 5 carrots + 2 cucumbers + 4 bell peppers + 7 green beans = 18 vegetables in total. The answer is 18.\n\n\n"
