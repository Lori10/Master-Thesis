  "test_question": "Q: Coach brought one bag filled with basketballs to practice and dumped them all out onto the gym floor before practice began.  After the practice time was over, he asked Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey to pick up the balls and carry them over to the bag.  The three boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip.  Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. If Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, what is the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Bertha started with two balls and gave one to her partner, so she has one ball left. Next, we need to figure out how many balls she loses and how many wear out. In 20 games, she loses 20/5 = 4 balls and 20/10 = 2 balls wear out. Finally, we need to figure out how many balls she buys. In 20 games, she buys 20/4 = 5 canisters of three balls, which is a total of 5*3 = 15 balls. So, in total, Bertha has 1 (starting ball) - 4 (lost balls) - 2 (worn out balls) + 15 (bought balls) = 10 tennis balls. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Jen and Tyler are gymnasts practicing flips. Jen is practicing the triple-flip while Tyler is practicing the double-flip. Jen did sixteen triple-flips during practice. Tyler flipped in the air half the number of times Jen did. How many double-flips did Tyler do?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many flips Tyler did in total. We know that Tyler did half the number of flips that Jen did, and Jen did 16 triple-flips. So, Tyler did: 16 triple-flips x 3 flips per triple-flip = 48 flips 48 flips / 2 = 24 flips Now we know that Tyler did 24 flips in total. We also know that Tyler was practicing double-flips, so we need to divide the total number of flips by 2 to find out how many double-flips he did: 24 flips / 2 = 12 double-flips Therefore, Tyler did 12 double-flips during practice. The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: Ivan has 20 dice. Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. How many dice do they have altogether?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Ivan has 20 dice. Next, we know that Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. So, we can multiply Ivan's number of dice by 2 to find Jerry's number of dice: 20 x 2 = 40 Therefore, Jerry has 40 dice. To find the total number of dice they have altogether, we can add Ivan's and Jerry's number of dice: 20 + 40 = 60 Therefore, they have 60 dice altogether. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Jason, Ryan, and Jeffery went fishing at the lake. Ryan caught three times the number of fish that Jason caught. Jefferey caught twice the number of fish that Ryan got.  If Jeffery caught 60 fish, how many fish did all of them catch in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Jeffery caught 60 fish. Next, we know that Jeffery caught twice the number of fish that Ryan caught. So, Ryan must have caught 60/2 = 30 fish. Finally, we know that Ryan caught three times the number of fish that Jason caught. So, Jason must have caught 30/3 = 10 fish. Therefore, the total number of fish caught by all of them is 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 fish. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Joe played catch with Derek and Tammy. He caught the ball 23 times. Derek made four less than double the catches Joe did. Tammy caught the ball sixteen more than a third of the times Derek did. How many times did Tammy catch the ball?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Joe caught the ball 23 times. Next, we need to figure out how many times Derek caught the ball. We know that he made four less than double the catches Joe did. So, we can set up an equation: Derek's catches = 2(Joe's catches) - 4 Derek's catches = 2(23) - 4 Derek's catches = 42 Now we need to figure out how many times Tammy caught the ball. We know that she caught the ball sixteen more than a third of the times Derek did. So, we can set up an equation: Tammy's catches = (1/3)(Derek's catches) + 16 Tammy's catches = (1/3)(42) + 16 Tammy's catches = 14 + 16 Tammy's catches = 30 Therefore, Tammy caught the ball 30 times. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: Malik rushed for 18 yards in each of 4 games. Josiah ran for 22 yards in each of 4 games. Darnell had an average of 11 yards rushed for each of the 4 games. How many yards did the 3 athletes run in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. Malik rushed for 18 yards in each of 4 games, so he ran a total of 18 x 4 = 72 yards. Josiah ran for 22 yards in each of 4 games, so he ran a total of 22 x 4 = 88 yards. Darnell had an average of 11 yards rushed for each of the 4 games, so he ran a total of 11 x 4 = 44 yards. To find the total yards run by the three athletes, we add up their individual totals: 72 + 88 + 44 = 204 yards. Therefore, the three athletes ran a total of 204 yards. The answer is 204.\n\n\nQ: Eric sorted 150 colored pencils into 5 containers for his art class. Before class, another teacher brought him 30 more pencils. How many can he evenly distribute between the five containers now?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of pencils Eric has now. To do this, we add the original 150 pencils to the 30 pencils brought by the other teacher: 150 + 30 = 180 So Eric now has 180 colored pencils. Next, we need to find out how many pencils he can evenly distribute between the five containers. To do this, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of containers: 180 \u00f7 5 = 36 Therefore, Eric can evenly distribute 36 colored pencils between each of the five containers. The answer is 36.\n\n\n"
