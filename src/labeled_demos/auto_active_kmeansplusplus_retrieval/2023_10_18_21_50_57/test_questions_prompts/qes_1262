  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Tim decides to do a movie marathon.  The first movie is 2 hours long.  The next movie is 50% longer.  And the last movie is 1 hour shorter than the combined time of the previous 2 movies.  How long was his movie marathon?\nA: Let's think step by step. First movie: 2 hours Second movie: 50% longer than the first movie = 2 + (50/100)*2 = 3 hours Total time for the first two movies: 2 + 3 = 5 hours Third movie: 1 hour shorter than the combined time of the previous two movies = 5 - 1 = 4 hours Total time for the movie marathon: 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 hours Therefore, Tim's movie marathon was 9 hours long. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Billy has 8 hours of free time on each day of the weekend. He wants to spend 75% of his time playing video games and the rest of his time reading. He can read 60 pages an hour and his books all contain 80 pages. How many books does he read?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts. First, we need to find out how much time Billy spends playing video games and how much time he spends reading. He has 8 hours of free time on each day of the weekend, so that's a total of 16 hours for the entire weekend. If he wants to spend 75% of his time playing video games, that means he will spend 0.75 x 16 = 12 hours playing video games. The rest of his time will be spent reading, which is 16 - 12 = 4 hours. Next, we need to find out how many pages he can read in 1 hour. We know that he can read 60 pages an hour, so that's 60 pages/hour. Finally, we need to find out how many books he can read in 4 hours. Each book contains 80 pages, so he can read 60/80 = 0.75 of a book in 1 hour. In 4 hours, he can read 4 x 0.75 = 3 books. Therefore, Billy can read 3 books during his free time on the weekend. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Debra is the host of a country music radio show, and she broadcasts interviews with celebrity country music singers. Each week, she interviews three singers, one at a time.  The first interview segment is always twice as long as the other two segments combined, and the third interview segment is always half as long as the second. If the third segment is 10 minutes long, how many minutes long is the entire show?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the third interview segment is 10 minutes long and is half as long as the second segment. Therefore, the second segment is 20 minutes long (10 x 2 = 20). Next, we know that the first segment is twice as long as the other two segments combined. So, the total length of the second and third segments is 20 + 10 = 30 minutes. Therefore, the first segment is 60 minutes long (30 x 2 = 60). Finally, to find the total length of the show, we add up the lengths of all three segments: 60 + 20 + 10 = 90 minutes. Therefore, the entire show is 90 minutes long. The answer is 90.\n\n\nQ: Bret takes a 9 hour train ride to go to Boston.   He spends 2 hours reading a book, 1 hour to eat his dinner, and 3 hours watching movies on his computer.  How many hours does he have left to take a nap?\nA: Let's think step by step. Bret takes a 9 hour train ride to go to Boston. He spends 2 hours reading a book, 1 hour to eat his dinner, and 3 hours watching movies on his computer. So, the total time he spends on these activities is 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 hours. Therefore, the time he has left to take a nap is 9 - 6 = 3 hours. So, Bret has 3 hours left to take a nap. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Larry jogs for 30 minutes each day. In the first week, he jogs for 3 days while he jogs for 5 days in the second week. How many hours does he jog in total for two weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days Larry jogs in two weeks. Larry jogs for 3 days in the first week and 5 days in the second week, so he jogs for a total of 3 + 5 = 8 days in two weeks. Next, we need to find out how many hours Larry jogs in one day. Larry jogs for 30 minutes each day, which is equivalent to 0.5 hours. Finally, we can calculate how many hours Larry jogs in total for two weeks by multiplying the number of days by the number of hours per day: 8 days x 0.5 hours per day = 4 hours Therefore, Larry jogs for a total of 4 hours in two weeks. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: James buys 3 CDs.  Two of them are 1.5 hours each.  The last one is twice that long.  What is the combined length of the CDs?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length of the third CD. We know that it is twice as long as the other two CDs, which are 1.5 hours each. So, the third CD is 1.5 x 2 = 3 hours long. Now, we can add up the lengths of all three CDs to find the combined length. Combined length = 1.5 + 1.5 + 3 Combined length = 6 hours Therefore, the combined length of the three CDs is 6 hours. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Gina chooses what she and her sister will watch on Netflix three times as often as her sister does. If her sister watches a total of 24 shows on Netflix per week, and each show is 50 minutes long, how many minutes of Netflix does Gina get to choose?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how often Gina chooses what they watch compared to her sister. We know that Gina chooses three times as often as her sister, so if her sister watches 24 shows per week, Gina chooses what they watch 3 times that amount, or 3 x 24 = 72 times per week. Next, we need to figure out how many minutes of Netflix each person gets to choose. We know that each show is 50 minutes long, so if Gina chooses 72 shows per week, she gets to choose 72 x 50 = 3600 minutes of Netflix per week. Therefore, Gina gets to choose 3600 minutes of Netflix per week. The answer is 3600.\n\n\nQ: Marla has to spend 20 minutes driving one way to her son's school, then 70 minutes attending parent-teacher night, then the same amount of time driving home. How many minutes does Marla spend on this errand in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we add the time Marla spends driving to her son's school and driving back home: 20 minutes (driving to school) + 20 minutes (driving back home) = 40 minutes Next, we add the time Marla spends at the parent-teacher night: 40 minutes (driving) + 70 minutes (parent-teacher night) = 110 minutes Therefore, Marla spends a total of 110 minutes on this errand. The answer is 110.\n\n\n"
