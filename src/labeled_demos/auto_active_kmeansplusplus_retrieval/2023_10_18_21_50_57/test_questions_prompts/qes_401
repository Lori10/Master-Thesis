  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Marla has to spend 20 minutes driving one way to her son's school, then 70 minutes attending parent-teacher night, then the same amount of time driving home. How many minutes does Marla spend on this errand in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we add the time Marla spends driving to her son's school and driving back home: 20 minutes (driving to school) + 20 minutes (driving back home) = 40 minutes Next, we add the time Marla spends at the parent-teacher night: 40 minutes (driving) + 70 minutes (parent-teacher night) = 110 minutes Therefore, Marla spends a total of 110 minutes on this errand. The answer is 110.\n\n\nQ: Micah, Dean, and Jake are all training for a marathon organized by a local NGO to support children in their town who have cancer. Micah runs 2/3 times as fast as Dean. It takes Jake 1/3 times more time to finish the marathon than it takes Mica. If Dean takes 9 hours, what's the total time the three take to complete the marathon?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Micah to finish the marathon since we know that he runs 2/3 times as fast as Dean. If Dean takes 9 hours, then Micah takes 2/3 * 9 = 6 hours to finish the marathon. Next, we need to find out how long it takes Jake to finish the marathon since we know that it takes him 1/3 times more time than Micah. If Micah takes 6 hours, then Jake takes 6 + (1/3 * 6) = 8 hours to finish the marathon. Finally, we can add up the times it takes each person to finish the marathon to get the total time. So, the total time the three take to complete the marathon is 9 + 6 + 8 = 23 hours. The answer is 23.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: Two old ladies spent the afternoon walking through Central Park.  The first lady walked twice as far as the second lady.  If the second lady walked four miles, what is the combined total distance, in miles, the two ladies walked?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the second lady walked 4 miles. Next, we know that the first lady walked twice as far as the second lady. So, we can multiply the second lady's distance by 2 to find the first lady's distance: 4 miles x 2 = 8 miles Therefore, the combined total distance the two ladies walked is: 4 miles + 8 miles = 12 miles The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: Betty and Dora started making some cupcakes at the same time. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour and Dora makes 8 every hour. If Betty took a two-hour break, what is the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Betty made in the first 3 hours before taking a break. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour, so in 3 hours, she would make: 10 cupcakes/hour x 3 hours = 30 cupcakes Next, we need to find out how many cupcakes Dora made in the same 5 hours. Dora makes 8 cupcakes every hour, so in 5 hours, she would make: 8 cupcakes/hour x 5 hours = 40 cupcakes Now we need to find the difference between the number of cupcakes they made. Betty made 30 cupcakes before taking a break, and Dora made 40 cupcakes in the same 5 hours. So the difference between the number of cupcakes they made is: 40 cupcakes - 30 cupcakes = 10 cupcakes Therefore, the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours is 10 cupcakes. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Ayen jogs for 30 minutes every day during weekdays. This week on Tuesday, she jogged 5 minutes more and also jogged 25 minutes more on Friday. How many hours, in total, did Ayen jog this week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long Ayen jogged on each weekday. She jogs for 30 minutes every day during weekdays, so from Monday to Thursday, she jogged for a total of 30 x 4 = 120 minutes. On Tuesday, she jogged 5 minutes more, so she jogged for 30 + 5 = 35 minutes. On Friday, she jogged 25 minutes more, so she jogged for 30 + 25 = 55 minutes. Therefore, Ayen jogged for a total of 120 + 35 + 55 = 210 minutes this week. To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 210 \u00f7 60 = 3.5 hours So Ayen jogged for a total of 3.5 hours this week. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: For homework, Brooke has 15 math problems, 6 social studies problems, and 10 science problems. He can answer each math problem for 2 minutes while answering each social studies problem takes him 30 seconds. If he can answer each science problem in 1.5 minutes, how long will it take Brooke to answer all his homework?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total time Brooke needs to answer all the math problems: 15 math problems x 2 minutes per problem = 30 minutes Next, let's calculate the total time Brooke needs to answer all the social studies problems: 6 social studies problems x 30 seconds per problem = 3 minutes Note that we converted the time to minutes since the time for math problems is given in minutes. Finally, let's calculate the total time Brooke needs to answer all the science problems: 10 science problems x 1.5 minutes per problem = 15 minutes Now, we can add up the time for each subject to get the total time Brooke needs to answer all his homework: 30 minutes (math) + 3 minutes (social studies) + 15 minutes (science) = 48 minutes Therefore, it will take Brooke 48 minutes to answer all his homework. The answer is 48.\n\n\nQ: Ann can skate 6 miles an hour. Her friend Glenda can skate 8 miles an hour. If they start in the same place and skate in straight lines in opposite directions for 3 hours, how many miles apart do they end up?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how far Ann and Glenda each skate in 3 hours. Ann: 6 miles/hour x 3 hours = 18 miles Glenda: 8 miles/hour x 3 hours = 24 miles Step 2: Add the distances they each skated to find the total distance between them. 18 miles + 24 miles = 42 miles Therefore, Ann and Glenda end up 42 miles apart after skating in opposite directions for 3 hours. The answer is 3.\n\n\n"
