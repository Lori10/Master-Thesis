  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Aliya and her classmates are sent by their teacher to the field to collect insects for science class study. The Boys collected 200 insects and the girls collected 300 insects. The teacher decided to divide the class equally into four groups that each get an equal number of insects so that each group could study together. What was the number of insects given to each group?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of insects collected by the class. Total number of insects = 200 (boys) + 300 (girls) = 500 Step 2: Divide the total number of insects by the number of groups. Number of insects per group = 500 \u00f7 4 = 125 Step 3: Therefore, each group will get 125 insects to study. The answer is 125.\n\n\nQ: A teacher is making packed lunches for a field trip. Each student needs 2 sandwiches, and will travel in a group with 5 other students. There are a total of 5 groups. How many pieces of bread will the teacher need to make enough sandwiches for all the students?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of students going on the field trip. Since each group has 6 students (1 student + 5 others), and there are 5 groups, the total number of students is: 6 students/group x 5 groups = 30 students Step 2: Find the total number of sandwiches needed. Since each student needs 2 sandwiches, the total number of sandwiches needed is: 2 sandwiches/student x 30 students = 60 sandwiches Step 3: Find the total number of bread slices needed. Since each sandwich has 2 slices of bread, the total number of bread slices needed is: 2 slices/sandwich x 60 sandwiches = 120 slices of bread Therefore, the teacher will need 120 slices of bread to make enough sandwiches for all the students. The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: For homework, Juan's teacher asked everyone in the class, to write down the different types of transportation (cars, trucks, bicycles, skateboards etc) they saw on their way home that afternoon.  After school, Juan walked home and saw the following: 15 cars, 3 bicycles, 8 pickup trucks and 1 tricycle.  How many tires in total were there on the vehicles Juan saw?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine the number of tires on each type of vehicle. - Cars have 4 tires each, so 15 cars would have 15 x 4 = 60 tires. - Bicycles have 2 tires each, so 3 bicycles would have 3 x 2 = 6 tires. - Pickup trucks have 4 tires each, so 8 pickup trucks would have 8 x 4 = 32 tires. - A tricycle has 3 tires. To find the total number of tires, we add up the number of tires for each type of vehicle: 60 + 6 + 32 + 3 = 101 Therefore, Juan saw a total of 101 tires on the vehicles he saw on his way home. The answer is 101.\n\n\nQ: There are 13 3-year-olds, 20 4-year-olds, 15 5-year-olds, and 22 six-year-olds at a particular Sunday school. If the 3 and 4-year-olds are in one class and the 5 and 6-year-olds are in another class, what is the average class size?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of students in each class. For the 3 and 4-year-olds class, we add the number of 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds: 13 + 20 = 33 For the 5 and 6-year-olds class, we add the number of 5-year-olds and 6-year-olds: 15 + 22 = 37 Next, we need to find the average class size. To do this, we add the total number of students in both classes and divide by the number of classes: (33 + 37) / 2 = 35 Therefore, the average class size is 35 students. The answer is 35.\n\n\nQ: Danny helps his friends carpool to work. He has to drive 8 miles to the first friend's house, half that distance to the second friend's house, then 3 times the total distance driven so far to get to work. How many miles does Danny drive between the second friend's house and work?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Danny drives 8 miles to the first friend's house. Then, he drives half that distance, which is 4 miles, to the second friend's house. So far, he has driven 8 + 4 = 12 miles. Next, he drives 3 times the total distance driven so far to get to work. The total distance driven so far is 12 miles, so he drives 3 x 12 = 36 miles to get to work. To find out how many miles Danny drives between the second friend's house and work, we need to subtract the distance he has already driven (8 miles to the first friend's house and 4 miles to the second friend's house) from the total distance he drives to get to work. So, Danny drives 36 - 8 - 4 = 24 miles between the second friend's house and work. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Dani brings two and half dozen cupcakes for her 2nd-grade class.  There are 27 students (including Dani), 1 teacher, and 1 teacher\u2019s aid.  If 3 students called in sick that day, how many cupcakes are left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Dani brought in total. Two and a half dozen cupcakes is equal to 30 cupcakes (since a dozen is 12). Next, we need to figure out how many people will be receiving cupcakes. There are 27 students, 1 teacher, and 1 teacher's aid, for a total of 29 people. However, 3 students called in sick, so we need to subtract them from the total. 29 - 3 = 26 people receiving cupcakes. Now, we need to subtract 26 cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes Dani brought. 30 - 26 = 4 cupcakes left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Marla has to spend 20 minutes driving one way to her son's school, then 70 minutes attending parent-teacher night, then the same amount of time driving home. How many minutes does Marla spend on this errand in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we add the time Marla spends driving to her son's school and driving back home: 20 minutes (driving to school) + 20 minutes (driving back home) = 40 minutes Next, we add the time Marla spends at the parent-teacher night: 40 minutes (driving) + 70 minutes (parent-teacher night) = 110 minutes Therefore, Marla spends a total of 110 minutes on this errand. The answer is 110.\n\n\nQ: Talia is playing football with her friends. The park they're playing at is 5 miles from Talia's house. After their game, Talia is planning to go to the grocery store 3 miles away from the park and 8 miles from her home. Starting and ending at Talia's house, how many miles does Talia drive that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Talia drives 5 miles from her house to the park. Then, she drives 3 miles from the park to the grocery store. Finally, she drives 8 miles from the grocery store back to her house. To find the total distance Talia drives that day, we can add up these three distances: 5 miles + 3 miles + 8 miles = 16 miles Therefore, Talia drives a total of 16 miles that day. The answer is 16.\n\n\n"
