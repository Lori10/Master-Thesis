  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Peter and Kristin are to read 20 fantasy novels each in a week. Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin. If Peter reads one book in 18 hours, how long will Kristin read half of her books?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Peter to read one book. We know that he can read one book in 18 hours, so we can write: Peter's reading speed = 1 book / 18 hours Next, we need to find out how long it takes Kristin to read one book. We know that Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin, so we can write: Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * Peter's reading speed Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * (1 book / 18 hours) Kristin's reading speed = 1 book / 54 hours Now we can use Kristin's reading speed to find out how long it takes her to read half of her books. We know that she needs to read 20 books in a week, so she needs to read 10 books in half a week (3.5 days). We can write: Time to read 10 books = 10 books * (1 book / 54 hours) * (24 hours / 1 day) * (3.5 days) Time to read 10 books = 14 hours and 27 minutes Therefore, it will take Kristin 14 hours and 27 minutes to read half of her books. The answer is 27.\n\n\nQ: Jerry works as an independent contractor for a company that pays him $40 per task. If each task takes him two hours to complete and he works 10 hours a day for a whole week, calculate the total amount of money he would earn at the end of the week.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many tasks Jerry can complete in a day. Since each task takes him two hours to complete, he can complete 10/2 = 5 tasks in a day. Next, we need to find out how many tasks Jerry can complete in a week. Since he works 10 hours a day for a whole week, he works a total of 10*7 = 70 hours in a week. Therefore, he can complete 70/2 = 35 tasks in a week. Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money Jerry would earn at the end of the week. Since he earns $40 per task, he would earn a total of 40*35 = $1400 at the end of the week. The answer is 1400.\n\n\nQ: Marla has to spend 20 minutes driving one way to her son's school, then 70 minutes attending parent-teacher night, then the same amount of time driving home. How many minutes does Marla spend on this errand in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we add the time Marla spends driving to her son's school and driving back home: 20 minutes (driving to school) + 20 minutes (driving back home) = 40 minutes Next, we add the time Marla spends at the parent-teacher night: 40 minutes (driving) + 70 minutes (parent-teacher night) = 110 minutes Therefore, Marla spends a total of 110 minutes on this errand. The answer is 110.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: Every hour Joanne has to collect the coins out of the fountain inside the mall. During the first hour, she collected 15 coins. For the next two hours, she collected 35 coins from the fountain. In the fourth hour, she collected 50 coins from the fountain but she gave 15 of them to her coworker so she could buy a soda. How many coins did she have after the fourth hour?\nA: Let's think step by step. First hour: Joanne collected 15 coins. Second and third hour: Joanne collected 35 coins each, so she collected a total of 35+35=70 coins. Fourth hour: Joanne collected 50 coins but gave 15 to her coworker, so she kept 50-15=35 coins. To find out how many coins Joanne had after the fourth hour, we need to add up all the coins she collected and subtract the ones she gave away: 15 + 70 + 35 = 120 coins collected 120 - 15 = 105 coins after giving 15 to her coworker. Therefore, Joanne had 105 coins after the fourth hour. The answer is 105.\n\n\nQ: Yvonne swims 10 laps in 5 minutes.  Her younger sister can swim half as many laps as Yvonne in the same time frame.  Their brother Joel can swim three times the number of laps as the youngest sister.  How many laps can Joel swim?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many laps Yvonne's younger sister can swim in 5 minutes. Since she can swim half as many laps as Yvonne, we can divide Yvonne's number of laps by 2: Yvonne's sister = 10 laps / 2 = 5 laps Next, we need to figure out how many laps Joel can swim. We know that he can swim three times the number of laps as the youngest sister, so we can multiply her number of laps by 3: Joel = 5 laps * 3 = 15 laps Therefore, Joel can swim 15 laps in 5 minutes. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: A factory uses robots to manufacture batteries. For each battery that is made, it takes a robot 6 minutes to gather the materials for the battery and 9 minutes to create the battery. If the factory has 10 robots working on batteries at the same time, how many batteries can the robots manufacture in 5 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 5 hours to minutes. 5 hours = 5 x 60 = 300 minutes Next, we need to find out how long it takes for one robot to make one battery. 6 minutes to gather materials + 9 minutes to create battery = 15 minutes per battery Now we can calculate how many batteries one robot can make in 300 minutes. 300 minutes \u00f7 15 minutes per battery = 20 batteries Finally, we can multiply the number of batteries one robot can make by the number of robots working. 20 batteries per robot x 10 robots = 200 batteries Therefore, the robots can manufacture 200 batteries in 5 hours. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Bret takes a 9 hour train ride to go to Boston.   He spends 2 hours reading a book, 1 hour to eat his dinner, and 3 hours watching movies on his computer.  How many hours does he have left to take a nap?\nA: Let's think step by step. Bret takes a 9 hour train ride to go to Boston. He spends 2 hours reading a book, 1 hour to eat his dinner, and 3 hours watching movies on his computer. So, the total time he spends on these activities is 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 hours. Therefore, the time he has left to take a nap is 9 - 6 = 3 hours. So, Bret has 3 hours left to take a nap. The answer is 3.\n\n\n"
