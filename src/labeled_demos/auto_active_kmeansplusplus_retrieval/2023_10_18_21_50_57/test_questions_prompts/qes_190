  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Tatuya, Ivanna, and Dorothy took a quiz together. Tatuya scored twice as much as Ivanna, and Ivanna scored 3/5 times as many marks as Dorothy. If Dorothy scored 90 marks, calculate the average marks scored by the three.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many marks Ivanna scored. We know that Ivanna scored 3/5 times as many marks as Dorothy, who scored 90 marks. So Ivanna scored: 3/5 * 90 = 54 marks Next, we need to find out how many marks Tatuya scored. We know that Tatuya scored twice as much as Ivanna, who scored 54 marks. So Tatuya scored: 2 * 54 = 108 marks Now we can find the total marks scored by the three of them: 90 + 54 + 108 = 252 marks Finally, we can calculate the average marks scored by the three: 252 / 3 = 84 marks Therefore, the average marks scored by Tatuya, Ivanna, and Dorothy is 84 marks. The answer is 84.\n\n\nQ: In the Golden State Team, each player earned points. Draymond earned 12 points, Curry earned twice the points as Draymond, Kelly earned 9, Durant earned twice the points as Kelly, Klay earned half the points as Draymond. How many points did the Golden States have in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. Draymond earned 12 points. Curry earned twice the points as Draymond, which is 2 x 12 = 24 points. Kelly earned 9 points. Durant earned twice the points as Kelly, which is 2 x 9 = 18 points. Klay earned half the points as Draymond, which is 1/2 x 12 = 6 points. To find the total points earned by the Golden State team, we add up all the points earned by each player: 12 + 24 + 9 + 18 + 6 = 69 points. Therefore, the Golden State team earned a total of 69 points. The answer is 69.\n\n\nQ: Ivan has 20 dice. Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. How many dice do they have altogether?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Ivan has 20 dice. Next, we know that Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. So, we can multiply Ivan's number of dice by 2 to find Jerry's number of dice: 20 x 2 = 40 Therefore, Jerry has 40 dice. To find the total number of dice they have altogether, we can add Ivan's and Jerry's number of dice: 20 + 40 = 60 Therefore, they have 60 dice altogether. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: A soccer team had 24 players prepared for a soccer game. The first half saw 11 players start the game with 2 substitutions made. In the second half, the team made twice as many substitutions as it made in the first half. How many players on the team did not play that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many players played in the first half. We know that 11 players started the game, and 2 substitutions were made, so a total of 13 players played in the first half. Next, we need to find out how many substitutions were made in the second half. We know that the team made twice as many substitutions as it made in the first half, so that means 2 x 2 = 4 substitutions were made in the second half. Now we can calculate how many players played in the second half. We know that there were 13 players who played in the first half, and 4 substitutions were made, so a total of 17 players played in the second half. Finally, we can calculate how many players did not play that day. We know that the team had 24 players prepared for the game, and 13 players played in the first half, and 17 players played in the second half. So, 24 - 13 - 17 = 4 players did not play that day. Therefore, there were 4 players on the team who did not play that day. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: The number of goals scored in a game against Barca by exactly two players last season accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league. If the players scored an equal number of goals, and the total number of goals scored in the league against Barca that season is 300, calculate the number of goals each of the two players scored.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the number of goals scored by the two players accounts for 20% of all goals scored in the league against Barca. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 0.2 * total goals in the league against Barca = number of goals scored by the two players We also know that the two players scored an equal number of goals, so we can let x be the number of goals each player scored. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as: 0.2 * 300 = 2x Simplifying the equation, we get: 60 = 2x Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 30 Therefore, each player scored 30 goals. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: Dana Point beach has four times the number of sharks as Newport Beach. If Newport Beach has 22 sharks, how many sharks are there in total on the two beaches?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many sharks there are at Dana Point beach. We know that Dana Point has four times the number of sharks as Newport Beach, so we can multiply the number of sharks at Newport Beach by 4: 4 x 22 = 88 So there are 88 sharks at Dana Point beach. Next, we need to find the total number of sharks on both beaches. We can add the number of sharks at Newport Beach to the number of sharks at Dana Point beach: 22 + 88 = 110 Therefore, there are 110 sharks in total on the two beaches. The answer is 110.\n\n\nQ: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Bertha started with two balls and gave one to her partner, so she has one ball left. Next, we need to figure out how many balls she loses and how many wear out. In 20 games, she loses 20/5 = 4 balls and 20/10 = 2 balls wear out. Finally, we need to figure out how many balls she buys. In 20 games, she buys 20/4 = 5 canisters of three balls, which is a total of 5*3 = 15 balls. So, in total, Bertha has 1 (starting ball) - 4 (lost balls) - 2 (worn out balls) + 15 (bought balls) = 10 tennis balls. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Before he lost one, Policeman O'Brien had 5 more than twice as many hats as fire chief Simpson. If fire chief Simpson has 15 hats, how many hats does Policeman O'Brien now have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many hats Policeman O'Brien had before he lost one. We know that he had 5 more than twice as many hats as fire chief Simpson, who has 15 hats. Twice as many hats as fire chief Simpson is 2 x 15 = 30 hats. Adding 5 more hats to that gives us 30 + 5 = 35 hats. So before he lost one, Policeman O'Brien had 35 hats. Now we need to figure out how many hats he has after losing one. If he had 35 hats and lost one, he now has 35 - 1 = 34 hats. Therefore, Policeman O'Brien now has 34 hats. The answer is 34.\n\n\n"
