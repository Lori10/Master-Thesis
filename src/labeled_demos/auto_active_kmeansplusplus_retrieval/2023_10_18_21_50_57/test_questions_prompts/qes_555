  "test_question": "Q: The rainstorm flooded the wetlands and washed Phineas Frog 200 yards away from his home in the swamp.  To return home, he will need to hop and swim his way back.  If he hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute, and swims through water at a speed of 10 yards per minute, how long will it take Phineas, in minutes, to return home if half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The white rabbit can hop 15 meters in one minute. The brown rabbit hops 12 meters per minute. What is the total distance the two rabbits will hop in 5 minutes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how far the white rabbit can hop in 5 minutes. To do this, we can multiply its speed by the time: 15 meters/minute x 5 minutes = 75 meters So the white rabbit can hop 75 meters in 5 minutes. Next, we need to find out how far the brown rabbit can hop in 5 minutes. Again, we can multiply its speed by the time: 12 meters/minute x 5 minutes = 60 meters So the brown rabbit can hop 60 meters in 5 minutes. To find the total distance the two rabbits will hop in 5 minutes, we simply add their distances: 75 meters + 60 meters = 135 meters Therefore, the two rabbits will hop a total distance of 135 meters in 5 minutes. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Xena is trying to outrun a dragon to get to the safety of a cave it's too big to fit into. Xena has a 600 foot head start, but the dragon can burn her if it gets within 120 feet of her. If Xena runs 15 feet per second and the dragon flies 30 feet per second, how many seconds does Xena have to get to the cave?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how fast the dragon can catch up to Xena. The dragon can cover 30 - 15 = 15 feet per second faster than Xena. Next, we need to find out how far the dragon needs to travel to catch up to Xena. This distance is 600 - 120 = 480 feet. Finally, we can use the formula distance = rate x time to find out how long Xena has to get to the cave. We can set up the equation as follows: 480 = 15t + 30t Simplifying the equation, we get: 480 = 45t Dividing both sides by 45, we get: t = 10.67 seconds Therefore, Xena has 10.67 seconds to get to the cave before the dragon catches up to her. The answer is 11.\n\n\nQ: Mr. Maxwell takes 1 hr to drive to work in the morning but 1 and half hours to drive back home in the evening. If the morning and evening traffic is similar and he drives at an average speed of 30mph in the morning, what is the average speed of his return journey?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time Since Mr. Maxwell drives at an average speed of 30mph in the morning and takes 1 hour to drive to work, we can calculate the distance he travels in the morning as: distance = 30 x 1 = 30 miles Now, we know that the distance he travels in the evening is the same as the distance he travels in the morning (assuming he takes the same route). So, we can use the formula again to find his average speed in the evening: speed = distance / time We know the distance is 30 miles, but we need to find the time it takes him to drive back home. We're told that it takes him 1 and a half hours, which we can also write as 1.5 hours. Therefore, his average speed in the evening is: speed = 30 / 1.5 = 20 mph So, the average speed of his return journey is 20 mph. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Yvonne swims 10 laps in 5 minutes.  Her younger sister can swim half as many laps as Yvonne in the same time frame.  Their brother Joel can swim three times the number of laps as the youngest sister.  How many laps can Joel swim?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many laps Yvonne's younger sister can swim in 5 minutes. Since she can swim half as many laps as Yvonne, we can divide Yvonne's number of laps by 2: Yvonne's sister = 10 laps / 2 = 5 laps Next, we need to figure out how many laps Joel can swim. We know that he can swim three times the number of laps as the youngest sister, so we can multiply her number of laps by 3: Joel = 5 laps * 3 = 15 laps Therefore, Joel can swim 15 laps in 5 minutes. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Jan enters a double dutch competition.  After training she doubles her speed which used to be 70 skips per minute.  How many skips does she do in 5 minutes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out Jan's new speed after doubling it. 70 skips per minute x 2 = 140 skips per minute Now that we know Jan's new speed, we can find out how many skips she does in 5 minutes. 140 skips per minute x 5 minutes = 700 skips Therefore, Jan does 700 skips in 5 minutes after doubling her speed. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Jill can run up a hill at 9 feet/second and down a hill at 12 feet/second. How long does it take her to run up and down a 900 foot hill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for Jill to run up the hill. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed The distance she runs up the hill is 900 feet, and her speed is 9 feet/second. So: time up = 900 / 9 = 100 seconds Next, we need to find the time it takes for Jill to run down the hill. Again, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed The distance she runs down the hill is also 900 feet, but her speed is 12 feet/second. So: time down = 900 / 12 = 75 seconds Finally, we need to find the total time it takes for Jill to run up and down the hill. Since she runs up and down separately, we can just add the two times: total time = time up + time down = 100 + 75 = 175 seconds Therefore, it takes Jill 175 seconds to run up and down a 900 foot hill. The answer is 900.\n\n\nQ: Peter and Kristin are to read 20 fantasy novels each in a week. Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin. If Peter reads one book in 18 hours, how long will Kristin read half of her books?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Peter to read one book. We know that he can read one book in 18 hours, so we can write: Peter's reading speed = 1 book / 18 hours Next, we need to find out how long it takes Kristin to read one book. We know that Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin, so we can write: Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * Peter's reading speed Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * (1 book / 18 hours) Kristin's reading speed = 1 book / 54 hours Now we can use Kristin's reading speed to find out how long it takes her to read half of her books. We know that she needs to read 20 books in a week, so she needs to read 10 books in half a week (3.5 days). We can write: Time to read 10 books = 10 books * (1 book / 54 hours) * (24 hours / 1 day) * (3.5 days) Time to read 10 books = 14 hours and 27 minutes Therefore, it will take Kristin 14 hours and 27 minutes to read half of her books. The answer is 27.\n\n\nQ: A train takes 4 hours to reach a destination at a speed of 50 miles per hour. How long would it take if it traveled at 100 miles per hour instead?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time We know that the distance is the same in both scenarios, so we can set the two equations equal to each other: 50 miles/hour x 4 hours = 100 miles/hour x time Simplifying this equation, we get: 200 miles = 100 miles/hour x time Dividing both sides by 100 miles/hour, we get: time = 2 hours Therefore, if the train traveled at 100 miles per hour instead of 50 miles per hour, it would take 2 hours to reach the destination. The answer is 2.\n\n\n"
