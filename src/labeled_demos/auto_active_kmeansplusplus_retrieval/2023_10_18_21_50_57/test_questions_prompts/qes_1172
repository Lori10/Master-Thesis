  "test_question": "Q: Carlos and Benji are at the beach. Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour and Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour. If Carlos uses the boat for 3 hours and Benji uses the raft for 5 hours, how much will they pay for their rentals, altogether?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Mitch has saved $20000 to finance his boating hobby. A new boat costs $1500 per foot in length. If Mitch needs to keep $500 for a license and registration, and three times that amount for docking fees, how many feet is the longest boat he can buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to subtract the amount Mitch needs to keep for license and registration and docking fees from his total savings: $20,000 - $500 - (3 x $500) = $18,500 Next, we need to divide this amount by the cost per foot of the boat: $18,500 \u00f7 $1500/ft = 12.33 ft Since we can't buy a fraction of a foot, we need to round down to the nearest whole number: The longest boat Mitch can buy is 12 feet long. The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: Jamie and Oliver are planning to go on a vacation. A plane ticket costs $24 for each person and a hotel stay costs $12 for each person per day. How much money will they spend on the vacation if they stay for 3 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets for both Jamie and Oliver. Since each ticket costs $24, the total cost of the tickets will be: $24 x 2 = $48 Next, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel stay. Since the cost is $12 per person per day, and they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel stay will be: $12 x 2 x 3 = $72 Finally, we need to add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay to get the total cost of the vacation: $48 + $72 = $120 Therefore, Jamie and Oliver will spend $120 on their vacation. The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: Five people are planning a party. Sonja will buy a loaf of French bread ($3 a loaf) and a platter of cold cuts ($23). Barbara will buy the soda ($1 per person) and two boxes of crackers ($2 per box). Mario and Rick will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles ($3 per package). Danica will supply a package of paper plates for $4. How much more will Sonja spend than the rest of the office put together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of Barbara's contribution. She will buy soda for 5 people, which will cost $5 (1 dollar per person). She will also buy two boxes of crackers, which will cost $4 (2 dollars per box). Therefore, Barbara's total contribution will be $9. Next, let's calculate the total cost of Mario and Rick's contribution. They will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles, which will cost $6 in total (3 dollars per package). Now, let's add up the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's. Barbara's contribution is $9, Mario and Rick's contribution is $6, and Danica's contribution is $4. Therefore, the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's is $19. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of Sonja's contribution. She will buy a loaf of French bread for $3 and a platter of cold cuts for $23. Therefore, Sonja's total contribution will be $26. To find out how much more Sonja will spend than the rest of the office put together, we need to subtract the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's from Sonja's total contribution. $26 (Sonja's contribution) - $19 (total cost of everyone else's contribution) = $7 Therefore, Sonja will spend $7 more than the rest of the office put together. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Alani earned $45 for 3 hours of baby-sitting. At the same rate, for how many hours would she need to baby-sit to earn $75?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much Alani earns per hour of baby-sitting. To do this, we can divide the total amount she earned by the number of hours she worked: $45 \u00f7 3 hours = $15 per hour Now that we know Alani earns $15 per hour of baby-sitting, we can use this rate to figure out how many hours she would need to work to earn $75. We can set up a proportion: $15 per hour = $75 \u00f7 x hours To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: $15x = $75 Then, we can divide both sides by 15: x = 5 hours Therefore, Alani would need to baby-sit for 5 hours to earn $75 at the same rate. The answer is 75.\n\n\nQ: Grant spends $200.00 a year to have the newspaper delivered daily to his house.  Juanita buys the newspaper daily.  Monday through Saturday, she spends $0.50 and on Sunday she spends $2.00.  How much more money does Juanita spend buying the newspaper yearly than Grant?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper daily from Monday to Saturday: $0.50 x 6 = $3.00 Now, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper on Sundays: $2.00 x 1 = $2.00 Next, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper weekly: $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00 Finally, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper yearly: $5.00 x 52 = $260.00 Now, let's calculate the difference between what Juanita spends and what Grant spends: $260.00 - $200.00 = $60.00 Therefore, Juanita spends $60.00 more buying the newspaper yearly than Grant. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: To get to an island called \"Virgo\", Tom needs to travel by plane and then by boat. The plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, and the boat trip takes up to 2 hours. In how many hours is Tom able to get to the \"Virgo\" island?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long the plane trip is. We know that the plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, so we can set up an equation: plane trip = 4 * boat trip Since we know the boat trip takes 2 hours, we can substitute that in: plane trip = 4 * 2 plane trip = 8 So the plane trip is 8 hours. Now we just need to add the plane trip and the boat trip together to find the total time: total time = plane trip + boat trip total time = 8 + 2 total time = 10 So Tom is able to get to the \"Virgo\" island in 10 hours. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Carlos and Diego are racing around the block. Carlos runs around the entire block in 3 minutes. Diego runs around half the block in 2.5 minutes and then is tripped by a dog and can't finish. Assuming he kept up the same speed the entire race, what would've been the average time in seconds for the racers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Diego to run the entire block. Since he runs half the block in 2.5 minutes, we can use proportion to find out: 2.5 minutes = 1/2 block x minutes = 1 block Cross-multiplying, we get: 2.5 * 2 = x * 1 5 = x So it would take Diego 5 minutes to run the entire block if he hadn't been tripped. Now we can find the average time for the racers. We add up the time it took Carlos and the time it would've taken Diego, and divide by the number of racers: (3 minutes + 5 minutes) / 2 racers = 4 minutes But the question asks for the answer in seconds, so we need to convert minutes to seconds: 4 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 240 seconds So the average time for the racers would've been 240 seconds. The answer is 240.\n\n\nQ: A fruit basket consists of 4 bananas, 3 apples, 24 strawberries, 2 avocados, and a bunch of grapes. One banana costs $1. An apple costs $2. 12 strawberries cost $4. An avocado costs $3, and half a bunch of grapes costs $2. What is the total cost of the fruit basket?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the bananas. Since one banana costs $1 and there are 4 bananas in the basket, the total cost of the bananas is 4 x $1 = $4. Next, we need to calculate the cost of the apples. Since one apple costs $2 and there are 3 apples in the basket, the total cost of the apples is 3 x $2 = $6. Now, let's calculate the cost of the strawberries. We know that 12 strawberries cost $4, so we can calculate the cost of 24 strawberries by multiplying the cost of 12 strawberries by 2. Therefore, the total cost of the strawberries is 2 x $4 = $8. Moving on to the avocados, we know that one avocado costs $3 and there are 2 avocados in the basket. Therefore, the total cost of the avocados is 2 x $3 = $6. Finally, we need to calculate the cost of the grapes. We know that half a bunch of grapes costs $2, but we don't know how many grapes are in the basket. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact cost of the grapes. Adding up the costs of all the other fruits, we get: $4 (bananas) + $6 (apples) + $8 (strawberries) + $6 (avocados) = $24 Therefore, the total cost of the fruit basket is $24 plus the cost of the grapes. The answer is 24.\n\n\n"
