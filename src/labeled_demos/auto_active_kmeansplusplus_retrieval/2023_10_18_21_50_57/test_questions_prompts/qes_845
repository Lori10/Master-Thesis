  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Stephen made 10 round trips up and down a 40,000 foot tall mountain. If he reached 3/4 of the mountain's height on each of his trips, calculate the total distance he covered.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much of the mountain Stephen climbed on each trip. If he reached 3/4 of the mountain's height on each trip, we can calculate this by multiplying the mountain's height by 3/4: 3/4 * 40,000 = 30,000 feet So Stephen climbed 30,000 feet on each trip. Since he made 10 round trips, we can multiply this by 20 to find out how much he climbed in total: 30,000 * 20 = 600,000 feet Therefore, Stephen covered a total distance of 600,000 feet. The answer is 600000.\n\n\nQ: Ryan works in an office that has an even number of men and women working there.  Ryan participates in a meeting composed of 4 men and 6 women who are pulled from the office floor.   This reduces the number of women working on the office floor by 20%.  How many people work at Ryan's office?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the number of men and women in the office is even. Let's call this number \"x\". Next, we know that 4 men and 6 women were pulled from the office floor for the meeting. This means that there are now x-4 men and x-6 women still working on the office floor. We also know that the number of women on the office floor decreased by 20%. This means that the new number of women on the office floor is 0.8(x-6). Since we know that the number of men and women in the office is even, we can set up an equation: x-4 + 0.8(x-6) = x Simplifying this equation: 0.8x - 1.2 = 0 0.8x = 1.2 x = 1.2/0.8 x = 1.5 Since we know that x is an even number, the closest even number to 1.5 is 2. Therefore, there are 2 men and 2 women working at Ryan's office. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Danny helps his friends carpool to work. He has to drive 8 miles to the first friend's house, half that distance to the second friend's house, then 3 times the total distance driven so far to get to work. How many miles does Danny drive between the second friend's house and work?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Danny drives 8 miles to the first friend's house. Then, he drives half that distance, which is 4 miles, to the second friend's house. So far, he has driven 8 + 4 = 12 miles. Next, he drives 3 times the total distance driven so far to get to work. The total distance driven so far is 12 miles, so he drives 3 x 12 = 36 miles to get to work. To find out how many miles Danny drives between the second friend's house and work, we need to subtract the distance he has already driven (8 miles to the first friend's house and 4 miles to the second friend's house) from the total distance he drives to get to work. So, Danny drives 36 - 8 - 4 = 24 miles between the second friend's house and work. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Tropical Storm Sally brings 3 days of rain to southern Texas.  The first day it rained 4 inches.  The second day it rained 5 times as much as the first day, and the third day it rained 6 inches less than the sum of the first two days.  How much did it rain on the third day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First day: 4 inches Second day: 5 times as much as the first day = 5 x 4 = 20 inches Third day: 6 inches less than the sum of the first two days = (4 + 20) - 6 = 18 inches Therefore, it rained 18 inches on the third day. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Sally, Sam, and Steve went to play with their marbles. In the beginning, Sam has twice as many marbles as Steve while Sally has 5 less than Sam. After Sam has given Sally and Steve 3 marbles each, Sam has 8 marbles left. How many marbles does Steve have now?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Sam had in the beginning. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve, so let's call the number of marbles Steve had \"x\". This means that Sam had 2x marbles. Next, we know that Sally had 5 less marbles than Sam, so Sally had 2x - 5 marbles. After Sam gave 3 marbles each to Sally and Steve, he was left with 8 marbles. This means that he gave away a total of 6 marbles (3 to Sally and 3 to Steve), so he must have started with 14 marbles (8 + 6 = 14). Now we can use this information to figure out how many marbles Steve has. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve in the beginning, so if Sam had 14 marbles, Steve must have had 7 marbles (14 \u00f7 2 = 7). After Sam gave Steve 3 marbles, Steve now has 10 marbles (7 + 3 = 10). The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Richard starts walking from Cincinnati to New York City, which is 70 miles. Richards walks 20 miles the first day. The next day he walks 6 miles less than half as much as he walked the first day. He walks 10 miles the third day. How many miles further does Richard have to walk to be in New York City?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Richard walks 20 miles. On the second day, he walks 6 miles less than half as much as he walked the first day. Half of what he walked on the first day is 20/2 = 10 miles. So, he walks 10 - 6 = 4 miles on the second day. On the third day, he walks 10 miles. Therefore, the total distance Richard has walked so far is 20 + 4 + 10 = 34 miles. To reach New York City, which is 70 miles away, Richard still has to walk 70 - 34 = 36 miles further. The answer is 36.\n\n\nQ: Eight people fit in a row on an airplane, and there are 12 rows. Only 3/4 of the seats in each row are allowed to be seated. How many seats will not be occupied on that plane?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many seats are in each row. Since only 3/4 of the seats in each row are allowed to be seated, we can multiply the number of seats in each row by 3/4 to find out how many seats are available in each row. Number of seats in each row = 8 x 3/4 = 6 Next, we need to find out how many seats are available on the plane. To do this, we can multiply the number of seats in each row by the number of rows. Number of seats on the plane = 6 x 12 = 72 Finally, we need to find out how many seats will not be occupied on the plane. To do this, we can subtract the number of passengers from the total number of seats. Number of seats not occupied = 72 - (8 x 12) = 72 - 96 = -24 Since we cannot have negative seats, we can conclude that all seats on the plane will be occupied. The answer is -24.\n\n\nQ: June made a design with 20 equal tiles. Three tiles are yellow and the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles. Six tiles are purple and the remaining tiles are white.  How many white tiles are there?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 3 yellow tiles. Next, we know that the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles, so there are 3+1=4 blue tiles. Then, we know that there are 6 purple tiles. So far, we have accounted for 3+4+6=13 tiles. Since there are 20 tiles in total, we can subtract 13 from 20 to find the number of white tiles: 20-13=7 Therefore, there are 7 white tiles in June's design. The answer is 7.\n\n\n"
