  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Joseph has a refrigerator, a water heater in his house, and an electric oven that consumes power at different rates. The total amount of money that Joseph pays for the energy used by the refrigerator is three times the amount he pays for the power used by the water heater. If the electric oven uses power worth $500 in a month, twice what Joseph pays for the power the water heater uses, calculate the total amount he pays for the power used by these gadgets.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much Joseph pays for the power used by the water heater. We know that the electric oven uses power worth $500 in a month, twice what Joseph pays for the power the water heater uses. So, if the power used by the water heater is x, then we can write: 2x = $500 Solving for x, we get: x = $250 Now we know that Joseph pays $250 for the power used by the water heater. We also know that the total amount of money that Joseph pays for the energy used by the refrigerator is three times the amount he pays for the power used by the water heater. So, if the power used by the water heater is x, then the power used by the refrigerator is 3x. Therefore, the total amount Joseph pays for the power used by these gadgets is: $250 + $500 + 3x Substituting x = $250, we get: $250 + $500 + 3($250) = $1,500 Therefore, Joseph pays a total of $1,500 for the power used by the refrigerator, water heater, and electric oven. The answer is 1500.\n\n\nQ: Noah\u2019s bedroom light uses 6 watts per hour. His office light is much brighter so he can see to work and uses three times as much energy. The living room light has a much larger space to cover and has to be more powerful, so it uses four times as much energy as his bedroom light. If Noah leaves all those lights on for two hours, how many watts has he used?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many watts Noah's office light uses per hour. We know that it uses three times as much energy as his bedroom light, which is 6 watts per hour. So, the office light uses 3 x 6 = 18 watts per hour. Next, we need to find out how many watts the living room light uses per hour. We know that it uses four times as much energy as his bedroom light, which is 6 watts per hour. So, the living room light uses 4 x 6 = 24 watts per hour. Now that we know the wattage per hour for each light, we can calculate the total watts used by multiplying the wattage per hour by the number of hours the lights were on. In this case, the lights were on for two hours, so: - Noah's bedroom light used 6 watts per hour x 2 hours = 12 watts - Noah's office light used 18 watts per hour x 2 hours = 36 watts - The living room light used 24 watts per hour x 2 hours = 48 watts Therefore, the total watts used by all three lights is 12 + 36 + 48 = 96 watts. The answer is 96.\n\n\nQ: Betty bought 1 kg of oranges and 3 kg of apples. The total cost of oranges was $12. The apples were two times cheaper than the oranges. How much did Betty pay for 1 kg of apples?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the total cost of oranges was $12. We don't know the cost per kilogram of oranges, but we can figure it out by dividing the total cost by the amount of oranges Betty bought: Cost per kilogram of oranges = $12 \u00f7 1 kg = $12/kg Next, we know that the apples were two times cheaper than the oranges. This means that the cost per kilogram of apples is half the cost per kilogram of oranges: Cost per kilogram of apples = 1/2 \u00d7 $12/kg = $6/kg Therefore, Betty paid $6 for 1 kg of apples. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: There are four lamps in Valerie's room. All of them are burnt out, so she needs to buy new light bulbs. She needs 3 small light bulbs and 1 large light bulb. She has $60 to spend. If small light bulbs cost $8 and large light bulbs cost $12, how much money will Valerie have left over?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total cost of the light bulbs Valerie needs to buy. The cost of 3 small light bulbs is: 3 x $8 = $24 The cost of 1 large light bulb is: 1 x $12 = $12 So the total cost is: $24 + $12 = $36 Next, we need to subtract the total cost from the amount of money Valerie has: $60 - $36 = $24 Therefore, Valerie will have $24 left over after buying the light bulbs. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Grant spends $200.00 a year to have the newspaper delivered daily to his house.  Juanita buys the newspaper daily.  Monday through Saturday, she spends $0.50 and on Sunday she spends $2.00.  How much more money does Juanita spend buying the newspaper yearly than Grant?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper daily from Monday to Saturday: $0.50 x 6 = $3.00 Now, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper on Sundays: $2.00 x 1 = $2.00 Next, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper weekly: $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00 Finally, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper yearly: $5.00 x 52 = $260.00 Now, let's calculate the difference between what Juanita spends and what Grant spends: $260.00 - $200.00 = $60.00 Therefore, Juanita spends $60.00 more buying the newspaper yearly than Grant. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Maria's monthly salary is $2000. 20% of her salary goes to paying tax, and 5% goes to insurance. Also, a quarter of the money left after the deductions is spent on utility bills. How much money does Maria have after the deductions and utility bills payment?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money goes to tax and insurance. Tax: 20% of $2000 = 0.2 x $2000 = $400 Insurance: 5% of $2000 = 0.05 x $2000 = $100 Next, we need to subtract the total amount of tax and insurance from Maria's monthly salary to find out how much money she has left. $2000 - $400 - $100 = $1500 Now, we need to find out how much money Maria spends on utility bills. A quarter of $1500 = 0.25 x $1500 = $375 Finally, we need to subtract the amount spent on utility bills from the money Maria has left after the deductions. $1500 - $375 = $1125 Therefore, Maria has $1125 left after the deductions and utility bills payment. The answer is 1125.\n\n\nQ: Maddie wants to see how much her mom spends on coffee each week. She makes herself 2 cups of coffee per day. Each cup has 1.5 ounces of coffee beans. A bag of coffee costs $8 and contains 10.5 ounces of beans. She uses 1/2 a gallon of milk per week. A gallon of milk costs $4. She doesn't add any sugar to the coffee. How much does she spend on her coffee per week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many ounces of coffee beans Maddie uses per week. She makes 2 cups of coffee per day, so that's 2 x 7 = 14 cups per week. Each cup has 1.5 ounces of coffee beans, so she uses 1.5 x 14 = 21 ounces of coffee beans per week. Next, we need to figure out how many bags of coffee she needs to buy. Each bag of coffee has 10.5 ounces of beans, so she needs 21 / 10.5 = 2 bags of coffee per week. Two bags of coffee cost $8 each, so she spends 2 x $8 = $16 on coffee per week. Finally, we need to calculate the cost of milk. She uses 1/2 a gallon of milk per week, which costs $4 per gallon. So, she spends 1/2 x $4 = $2 on milk per week. Adding the cost of coffee and milk, Maddie spends $16 + $2 = $18 on her coffee per week. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Tara's taking a road trip for the weekend.  She drives for two days, stopping to fill up her gas tank each time from empty to full when she needs it.  She visits 4 different gas stations in total, with the price of gas being $3, $3.50, $4, and $4.50 respectively at each.  If Tara's car has a 12-gallon tank, how much does she spend on gas for her road trip?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how much gas Tara needs to fill up her 12-gallon tank each time. To do this, we can simply multiply 12 by 1, since she is filling up from empty to full each time. So, Tara needs 12 gallons of gas at each of the 4 gas stations she visits. Next, we need to calculate how much she spends at each gas station. At the first gas station, where gas is $3 per gallon, Tara spends 12 x 3 = $36. At the second gas station, where gas is $3.50 per gallon, Tara spends 12 x 3.5 = $42. At the third gas station, where gas is $4 per gallon, Tara spends 12 x 4 = $48. And finally, at the fourth gas station, where gas is $4.50 per gallon, Tara spends 12 x 4.5 = $54. To find the total amount Tara spends on gas for her road trip, we simply add up the amounts she spent at each gas station: $36 + $42 + $48 + $54 = $180 Therefore, Tara spends $180 on gas for her road trip. The answer is 180.\n\n\n"
