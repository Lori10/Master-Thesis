  "test_question": "Q: Susan made 100 cookies for Christmas and was going to equally divide them between her 6 nephews. Before Susan could package them, her husband snuck 4 cookies for himself. How many cookies will each of Susan\u2019s nephews get?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Cristine bought a dozen lemons and gave 1/4 of them to her neighbor. How many lemons does Cristine have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine how many lemons are in a dozen. A dozen is equal to 12, so Cristine bought 12 lemons. Next, we need to figure out how many lemons Cristine gave to her neighbor. She gave away 1/4 of the lemons, which means she gave away 1/4 x 12 = 3 lemons. To find out how many lemons Cristine has left, we need to subtract the number of lemons she gave away from the total number of lemons she bought. 12 - 3 = 9 Therefore, Cristine has 9 lemons left. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Valerie\u2019s cookie recipe makes 16 dozen cookies and calls for 4 pounds of butter.  She only wants to make 4 dozen cookies for the weekend.  How many pounds of butter will she need?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cookies Valerie needs to make for the weekend. Since she only wants to make 4 dozen cookies, we can calculate that as: 4 dozen cookies = 4 x 12 = 48 cookies Next, we need to figure out how much butter is needed for 16 dozen cookies. If 16 dozen cookies require 4 pounds of butter, we can set up a proportion: 16 dozen cookies / 4 pounds of butter = 1 dozen cookies / x pounds of butter To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 16 dozen cookies * x pounds of butter = 4 pounds of butter * 1 dozen cookies 16x = 48 x = 3 Therefore, Valerie will need 3 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen cookies for the weekend. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Mary bought a packet of 1500 stickers. She shared them between Susan, Andrew and Sam in the ratio 1:1:3 respectively. If Sam gave Andrew two-thirds of his own share, how many stickers does Andrew now have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 1+1+3=5. Next, we need to find the size of each part by dividing the total number of stickers by the total number of parts: 1500/5=300. So, Susan and Andrew each get one part, which is 300 stickers each. Sam gets three parts, which is 900 stickers. Now, we need to find out how many stickers Sam gave to Andrew. Two-thirds of Sam's share is (2/3)*900=600. Therefore, Andrew now has 300+600=900 stickers. The answer is 900.\n\n\nQ: Harry uses a whole bag of chocolate chips when he makes dough for chocolate chip cookies. The dough makes three batches of cookies, and each cookie has nine chocolate chips in it. A bag of chocolate chips has 81 chips in it. How many cookies are in a batch?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Harry uses a whole bag of chocolate chips for three batches of cookies. So, we can divide the number of chips in a bag by 3 to find out how many chips are in each batch: 81 chips / 3 batches = 27 chips per batch Next, we know that each cookie has 9 chocolate chips in it. So, we can divide the number of chips per batch by 9 to find out how many cookies are in each batch: 27 chips per batch / 9 chips per cookie = 3 cookies per batch Therefore, there are 3 cookies in each batch. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Brenda volunteered to make 3 trays of banana pudding for the family reunion.  Each tray of banana pudding would need 80 wafer cookies.  A box of wafer cookies only had 60 cookies per box.  Each box costs $3.50.  How much will it cost her to buy just enough boxes for 3 trays of banana pudding?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many wafer cookies Brenda needs in total. She needs 80 cookies per tray and she's making 3 trays, so she needs: 80 x 3 = 240 wafer cookies Next, we need to figure out how many boxes of cookies she needs to buy. Each box has 60 cookies, so we can divide the total number of cookies needed by the number of cookies per box: 240 \u00f7 60 = 4 boxes So Brenda needs to buy 4 boxes of cookies. Each box costs $3.50, so we can multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box: 4 x $3.50 = $14 Therefore, it will cost Brenda $14 to buy just enough boxes for 3 trays of banana pudding. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Mary wants 144 cupcakes for her party. Mary has already made 36 cherry cupcakes, and 48 berry cupcakes. Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes for the rest. How much of each should she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Mary has already made: 36 cherry + 48 berry = 84 cupcakes Next, we need to figure out how many more cupcakes Mary needs to make: 144 total cupcakes - 84 cupcakes already made = 60 cupcakes Since Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, we can divide the remaining 60 cupcakes by 2: 60 cupcakes \u00f7 2 = 30 cupcakes of each flavor Therefore, Mary should make 30 chocolate cupcakes and 30 vanilla cupcakes to have a total of 144 cupcakes for her party. The answer is 144.\n\n\nQ: Anna is making gingerbread cookies. She gives 6 of them red hats, 9 of them blue boots, and 3 of them both red hats and blue boots. What percentage of the gingerbread men have red hats?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many gingerbread men there are in total. We can do this by adding the number of gingerbread men with red hats (6) to the number of gingerbread men with blue boots (9), and then subtracting the number of gingerbread men with both red hats and blue boots (3): 6 + 9 - 3 = 12 So there are 12 gingerbread men in total. Next, we need to find out how many of these gingerbread men have red hats. We already know that 6 of them have red hats and 3 of them have both red hats and blue boots. So we can subtract the 3 from the 6 to get the number of gingerbread men with only red hats: 6 - 3 = 3 Therefore, 3 gingerbread men have only red hats. To find the percentage of gingerbread men with red hats, we can divide the number of gingerbread men with only red hats (3) by the total number of gingerbread men (12), and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage: (3/12) x 100 = 25% So 25% of the gingerbread men have red hats. The answer is 25.\n\n\nQ: There were 90 jellybeans in a jar. Samantha snuck 24 jellybeans out of the jar, without being seen. Shelby ate 12 jellybeans from the jar. Their mom, Shannon, refilled the jar with half as much as Samantha and Shelby took out. How many jellybeans are in the jar now?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Samantha took out 24 jellybeans from the jar. Step 2: Shelby ate 12 jellybeans from the jar. Step 3: The total number of jellybeans taken out of the jar is 24 + 12 = 36. Step 4: Shannon refilled the jar with half as much as Samantha and Shelby took out, which is 1/2 * 36 = 18 jellybeans. Step 5: The total number of jellybeans in the jar now is 90 - 36 + 18 = 72 jellybeans. Therefore, there are 72 jellybeans in the jar now. The answer is 72.\n\n\n"
