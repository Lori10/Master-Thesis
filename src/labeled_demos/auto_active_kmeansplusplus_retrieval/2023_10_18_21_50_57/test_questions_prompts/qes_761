  "test_question": "Q: A large bag of Starbursts candy has 232 pieces of individually wrapped candies.  If this bag has 54 red candies, twice that amount of orange candies and half as many yellow candies as red candies, how many candies are pink?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: There are 5 green candies, 3 blue candies, and 4 red candies in a bag. If Violet randomly picks a candy from the bag, how likely is it that it's blue?\nA: Let's think step by step. There are a total of 5 + 3 + 4 = 12 candies in the bag. The probability of picking a blue candy is the number of blue candies divided by the total number of candies: P(blue) = 3/12 Simplifying this fraction, we get: P(blue) = 1/4 Therefore, the probability of picking a blue candy is 1/4 or 25%. The answer is 25.\n\n\nQ: Penelope has 5 M&M candies for every 3 Starbursts candies. If she has 25 M&M candies, how many Starbursts candies does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out the ratio of M&M candies to Starbursts candies. According to the problem, Penelope has 5 M&M candies for every 3 Starbursts candies. This can be written as: 5 M&M candies : 3 Starbursts candies Next, we need to use this ratio to figure out how many Starbursts candies Penelope has. We know that she has 25 M&M candies, so we can set up a proportion: 5 M&M candies / 3 Starbursts candies = 25 M&M candies / x Starbursts candies To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 5 M&M candies * x Starbursts candies = 3 Starbursts candies * 25 M&M candies 5x = 75 x = 15 Therefore, Penelope has 15 Starbursts candies. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: MIlle is making snack packs for her kindergarten class. She's going to divide 64 pretzels, four times as many goldfish, and 32 suckers into baggies for the 16 kids in the class. How many items does each baggie have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many goldfish there are. We know that there are four times as many goldfish as pretzels, so: 64 pretzels x 4 = 256 goldfish Next, we need to add up the total number of items: 64 pretzels + 256 goldfish + 32 suckers = 352 items Now we can divide the total number of items by the number of baggies: 352 items \u00f7 16 baggies = 22 items per baggie Therefore, each baggie will have 22 items, which includes pretzels, goldfish, and suckers. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: There are 10 bags with 30 oranges each on a truck. A total of 50 pieces of oranges are rotten. Thirty pieces of oranges will be kept for making orange juice and the rest will be sold. How many pieces of oranges will be sold?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of oranges in the 10 bags. 10 bags x 30 oranges/bag = 300 oranges Next, we need to subtract the number of rotten oranges. 300 oranges - 50 rotten oranges = 250 good oranges Now, we know that 30 oranges will be kept for making juice. 250 good oranges - 30 oranges for juice = 220 oranges to be sold Therefore, 220 pieces of oranges will be sold. The answer is 220.\n\n\nQ: Shelby was having a movie party for her birthday. She and her mom made a dozen bags of buttered popcorn and 10 bags of caramel popcorn. Her brother Alan took 3 bags of buttered popcorn and 1 bag of caramel popcorn for his friends. How many bags of popcorn does Shelby have left for the party?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine how many bags of popcorn Shelby had before her brother took some. Shelby had a dozen bags of buttered popcorn, which is equal to 12. She also had 10 bags of caramel popcorn. So, in total, she had 12 + 10 = 22 bags of popcorn. Next, we need to subtract the bags of popcorn that Alan took. Alan took 3 bags of buttered popcorn and 1 bag of caramel popcorn, which is a total of 4 bags. So, Shelby is left with 22 - 4 = 18 bags of popcorn for the party. Therefore, Shelby has 18 bags of popcorn left for the party. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: A total of 107 oranges are picked by Del and Juan. Del picked 23 on each of 2 days and Juan picked the rest. How many oranges did Juan pick?\nA: Let's think step by step. Del picked 23 oranges on each of 2 days, so he picked a total of 23 x 2 = 46 oranges. If the total number of oranges picked by both Del and Juan is 107, then Juan picked 107 - 46 = 61 oranges. Therefore, Juan picked 61 oranges. The answer is 61.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: There were 90 jellybeans in a jar. Samantha snuck 24 jellybeans out of the jar, without being seen. Shelby ate 12 jellybeans from the jar. Their mom, Shannon, refilled the jar with half as much as Samantha and Shelby took out. How many jellybeans are in the jar now?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Samantha took out 24 jellybeans from the jar. Step 2: Shelby ate 12 jellybeans from the jar. Step 3: The total number of jellybeans taken out of the jar is 24 + 12 = 36. Step 4: Shannon refilled the jar with half as much as Samantha and Shelby took out, which is 1/2 * 36 = 18 jellybeans. Step 5: The total number of jellybeans in the jar now is 90 - 36 + 18 = 72 jellybeans. Therefore, there are 72 jellybeans in the jar now. The answer is 72.\n\n\n"
