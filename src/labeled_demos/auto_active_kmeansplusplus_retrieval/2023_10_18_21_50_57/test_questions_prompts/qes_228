  "test_question": "Q: Mary has 30 sheep. She gets 1 kg of milk from half of them and 2 kg of milk from the other half every day. How much milk does she collect every day?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much milk one cow produces in a week. We can do this by dividing the total amount of milk produced in 5 weeks (2160 liters) by the number of weeks (5) and the number of cows (x): 2160 = 6x * 108 * 5 2160 = 540x x = 4 Therefore, there are 4 cows on the farm. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Martin owns a farm with hens. 10 hens do lay 80 eggs in 10 days. Martin decided to buy 15 more hens. How many eggs will all hens lay in 15 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many eggs one hen lays in 10 days. We can do this by dividing the total number of eggs laid by 10 hens by 10 days: 80 eggs \u00f7 10 hens \u00f7 10 days = 0.8 eggs per hen per day Now that we know how many eggs one hen lays per day, we can find out how many eggs all 25 hens will lay in 15 days: 25 hens \u00d7 0.8 eggs per hen per day \u00d7 15 days = 300 eggs Therefore, all 25 hens will lay 300 eggs in 15 days. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Colby harvested his mango trees, the total mangoes he harvested is 60 kilograms. He sold 20 kilograms to the market and sold the remaining half to his community. If each kilogram contains 8 mangoes, how many mangoes does he still have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many kilograms of mangoes Colby sold to his community. We know that he sold 20 kilograms to the market, so he had 60 - 20 = 40 kilograms left. Next, we need to find out how many kilograms of mangoes he sold to his community. We know that he sold half of the remaining 40 kilograms, which is 40/2 = 20 kilograms. Finally, we need to find out how many mangoes he still has. We know that each kilogram contains 8 mangoes, so he sold a total of 20 + 20 = 40 kilograms, which is equivalent to 40 x 8 = 320 mangoes. Therefore, Colby still has 60 - 40 = 20 kilograms of mangoes, which is equivalent to 20 x 8 = 160 mangoes. The answer is 160.\n\n\nQ: Mary has 26 blue shirts and 36 brown shirts. If she gives away half of her blue shirts and a third of her brown shirts, how many shirts does she have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many blue shirts Mary gives away. Half of her blue shirts would be: 26 / 2 = 13 So Mary gives away 13 blue shirts. Next, we need to find out how many brown shirts Mary gives away. A third of her brown shirts would be: 36 / 3 = 12 So Mary gives away 12 brown shirts. Now we can find out how many shirts Mary has left. She started with 26 blue shirts and gave away 13, so she has: 26 - 13 = 13 blue shirts left She started with 36 brown shirts and gave away 12, so she has: 36 - 12 = 24 brown shirts left Therefore, Mary has 13 + 24 = 37 shirts left. The answer is 37.\n\n\nQ: Merry had 50 boxes of apples on Saturday and 25 boxes on Sunday. There were 10 apples in each box. If she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, how many boxes of apples are left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many apples Merry had in total. On Saturday, she had 50 boxes of apples, and each box had 10 apples, so she had 50 x 10 = 500 apples on Saturday. On Sunday, she had 25 boxes of apples, and each box had 10 apples, so she had 25 x 10 = 250 apples on Sunday. In total, she had 500 + 250 = 750 apples. Next, we need to find out how many apples she sold. We know that she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, so she must have had 750 - 720 = 30 apples left. Finally, we need to find out how many boxes of apples she has left. We know that there are 10 apples in each box, so she must have 30 / 10 = 3 boxes of apples left. Therefore, Merry has 3 boxes of apples left. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Melody has three dogs. Each dog eats 1/2 of a pound of dog food twice a day. If Melody bought 30 pounds of dog food, how many pounds of dog food are left after a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much dog food each dog eats in a day. Since each dog eats 1/2 of a pound of dog food twice a day, each dog eats a total of 1 pound of dog food per day (1/2 + 1/2 = 1). So, three dogs would eat a total of 3 pounds of dog food per day (3 x 1 = 3). In a week, which is 7 days, the dogs would eat a total of 21 pounds of dog food (3 x 7 = 21). If Melody bought 30 pounds of dog food and the dogs ate 21 pounds in a week, then there would be 9 pounds of dog food left (30 - 21 = 9). Therefore, after a week, Melody would have 9 pounds of dog food left. The answer is 9.\n\n\n"
