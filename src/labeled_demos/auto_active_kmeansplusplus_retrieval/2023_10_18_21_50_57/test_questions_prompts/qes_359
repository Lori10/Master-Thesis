  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: A group of 30 tourists sets out on a walking tour of the rainforest. Two tourists are eaten by anacondas, then half the remaining tourists try to pet poisonous dart frogs and get poisoned. If only 1/7 of the poisoned tourists recovered, how many tourists are left at the end of the tour?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Start with 30 tourists. Step 2: Two tourists are eaten by anacondas, so we subtract 2 from 30 to get 28 tourists remaining. Step 3: Half of the remaining tourists try to pet poisonous dart frogs and get poisoned. Half of 28 is 14, so we subtract 14 from 28 to get 14 tourists remaining. Step 4: Only 1/7 of the poisoned tourists recovered. 1/7 of 14 is 2, so we add 2 to the 14 tourists remaining to get 16 tourists at the end of the tour. Therefore, there are 16 tourists left at the end of the tour. The answer is 16.\n\n\nQ: A zoo has 8 parrots. It 3 times the number of snakes than parrots and 2 times the number of monkeys than snakes. The number of elephants is half the number of parrots and snakes added up, and there are 3 fewer zebras than elephants. What is the difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the zoo has 8 parrots. Next, we are told that there are 3 times as many snakes as parrots. So, the number of snakes would be 3 x 8 = 24. Then, we are told that there are 2 times as many monkeys as snakes. So, the number of monkeys would be 2 x 24 = 48. The number of elephants is half the number of parrots and snakes added up. So, the number of elephants would be (8 + 24) / 2 = 16. Finally, we are told that there are 3 fewer zebras than elephants. So, the number of zebras would be 16 - 3 = 13. The difference between the number of zebras and monkeys would be 48 - 13 = 35. Therefore, the difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys is 35. The answer is 35.\n\n\nQ: Los Angeles has 6 million people living in it. If half the population is women and 1/3 of the women work in retail, how many women work in retail in Los Angeles?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of women in Los Angeles. Half of the population is women, so we can calculate: 6 million / 2 = 3 million women Step 2: Find the number of women who work in retail. One-third of the women work in retail, so we can calculate: 3 million / 3 = 1 million women work in retail Therefore, there are 1 million women who work in retail in Los Angeles. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Mary has 26 blue shirts and 36 brown shirts. If she gives away half of her blue shirts and a third of her brown shirts, how many shirts does she have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many blue shirts Mary gives away. Half of her blue shirts would be: 26 / 2 = 13 So Mary gives away 13 blue shirts. Next, we need to find out how many brown shirts Mary gives away. A third of her brown shirts would be: 36 / 3 = 12 So Mary gives away 12 brown shirts. Now we can find out how many shirts Mary has left. She started with 26 blue shirts and gave away 13, so she has: 26 - 13 = 13 blue shirts left She started with 36 brown shirts and gave away 12, so she has: 36 - 12 = 24 brown shirts left Therefore, Mary has 13 + 24 = 37 shirts left. The answer is 37.\n\n\nQ: There are 48 passengers on the bus. Two-thirds of the passengers are women and the rest are men.  If one-eighth of the men are standing, how many men are seated?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many women are on the bus. We know that two-thirds of the passengers are women, so we can set up an equation: 2/3 x 48 = 32 So there are 32 women on the bus. Next, we need to find out how many men are on the bus. We know that the rest of the passengers are men, so we can subtract the number of women from the total number of passengers: 48 - 32 = 16 So there are 16 men on the bus. Now we need to find out how many of the men are standing. We know that one-eighth of the men are standing, so we can set up another equation: 1/8 x 16 = 2 So there are 2 men standing. Finally, we can find out how many men are seated by subtracting the number of men standing from the total number of men: 16 - 2 = 14 So there are 14 men seated on the bus. The answer is 14.\n\n\nQ: A park has three colors of flowering crepe myrtle trees planted: red, white, and pink. When they bloom, a third of them are pink, but only two are red. Most of them are white. There are 42 crepe myrtle trees in the park. How many have white flowers when they bloom?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that a third of the trees are pink. So, we can find the number of pink trees by dividing the total number of trees by 3: 42 \u00f7 3 = 14 So, there are 14 pink trees in the park. Next, we know that only two trees are red. So, we can subtract those from the total number of trees to find the number of white trees: 42 - 14 - 2 = 26 Therefore, there are 26 crepe myrtle trees with white flowers when they bloom. The answer is 26.\n\n\nQ: Two-thirds of the class have brown eyes. Half of the students with brown eyes have black hair. If there are 6 students in the class with brown eyes and black hair, how many students are there in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that two-thirds of the class have brown eyes. Let's represent the total number of students in the class as \"x\". Then, we can write: (2/3)x = number of students with brown eyes Next, we know that half of the students with brown eyes have black hair. So, we can take half of the number of students with brown eyes to find the number of students with both brown eyes and black hair: (1/2)(2/3)x = 6 Simplifying this equation, we get: (1/3)x = 6 Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: x = 18 Therefore, there are 18 students in total. The answer is 18.\n\n\n"
