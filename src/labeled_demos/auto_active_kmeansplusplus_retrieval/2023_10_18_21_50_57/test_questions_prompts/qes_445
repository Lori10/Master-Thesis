  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Joe played catch with Derek and Tammy. He caught the ball 23 times. Derek made four less than double the catches Joe did. Tammy caught the ball sixteen more than a third of the times Derek did. How many times did Tammy catch the ball?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Joe caught the ball 23 times. Next, we need to figure out how many times Derek caught the ball. We know that he made four less than double the catches Joe did. So, we can set up an equation: Derek's catches = 2(Joe's catches) - 4 Derek's catches = 2(23) - 4 Derek's catches = 42 Now we need to figure out how many times Tammy caught the ball. We know that she caught the ball sixteen more than a third of the times Derek did. So, we can set up an equation: Tammy's catches = (1/3)(Derek's catches) + 16 Tammy's catches = (1/3)(42) + 16 Tammy's catches = 14 + 16 Tammy's catches = 30 Therefore, Tammy caught the ball 30 times. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: Jason, Ryan, and Jeffery went fishing at the lake. Ryan caught three times the number of fish that Jason caught. Jefferey caught twice the number of fish that Ryan got.  If Jeffery caught 60 fish, how many fish did all of them catch in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Jeffery caught 60 fish. Next, we know that Jeffery caught twice the number of fish that Ryan caught. So, Ryan must have caught 60/2 = 30 fish. Finally, we know that Ryan caught three times the number of fish that Jason caught. So, Jason must have caught 30/3 = 10 fish. Therefore, the total number of fish caught by all of them is 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 fish. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: 1,800 fish swim westward, 3,200 swim eastward, and 500 swim north. What is the number of fish left in the sea, if fishers catch 2/5 of the fish that swam eastward and 3/4 of the fish that swam westward?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many fish were caught by the fishers. 2/5 of 3,200 fish that swam eastward is: (2/5) x 3,200 = 1,280 fish 3/4 of 1,800 fish that swam westward is: (3/4) x 1,800 = 1,350 fish So, the total number of fish caught by the fishers is: 1,280 + 1,350 = 2,630 fish Now, we need to subtract the number of fish caught by the fishers from the total number of fish: 1,800 + 3,200 + 500 - 2,630 = 2,870 fish Therefore, there are 2,870 fish left in the sea. The answer is 2870.\n\n\nQ: Emily goes fishing and has a very busy day. She catches 4 trout, 3 catfish, and 5 bluegills. If the trout weigh 2 pounds each, the catfish weigh 1.5 pounds each, and the bluegills weigh 2.5 pounds each, how many total pounds of fish did she catch?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total weight of the trout. Emily caught 4 trout, and each trout weighs 2 pounds, so the total weight of the trout is: 4 trout x 2 pounds/trout = 8 pounds Next, we need to calculate the total weight of the catfish. Emily caught 3 catfish, and each catfish weighs 1.5 pounds, so the total weight of the catfish is: 3 catfish x 1.5 pounds/catfish = 4.5 pounds Finally, we need to calculate the total weight of the bluegills. Emily caught 5 bluegills, and each bluegill weighs 2.5 pounds, so the total weight of the bluegills is: 5 bluegills x 2.5 pounds/bluegill = 12.5 pounds Now, we can add up the weight of all the fish to find the total weight: 8 pounds + 4.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds = 25 pounds Therefore, Emily caught a total of 25 pounds of fish. The answer is 25.\n\n\nQ: Lewis found 4 more items on the scavenger hunt than Samantha.  Samantha found four times the amount of items than Tanya who was only able to find 4 items.  How many items did Lewis find?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many items Samantha found. We know that Samantha found four times the amount of items than Tanya, who found 4 items. So Samantha found 4 x 4 = 16 items. Next, we know that Lewis found 4 more items than Samantha. So we can add 4 to Samantha's total: 16 + 4 = 20. Therefore, Lewis found 20 items on the scavenger hunt. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Marion received 20 more turtles than Martha at the animal rescue center where they had gone to take part in the animal saving day event. If Martha received 40 turtles, how many turtles did they receive together?\nA: Let's think step by step. Martha received 40 turtles. Marion received 20 more turtles than Martha, which means Marion received 40 + 20 = 60 turtles. To find out how many turtles they received together, we need to add Martha's turtles to Marion's turtles: 40 + 60 = 100. Therefore, they received 100 turtles together. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Trent caught 180 tadpoles then let 75% of them go. How many did he keep?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many tadpoles Trent let go. To do this, we can multiply the total number of tadpoles by the percentage he let go: 180 x 0.75 = 135 So Trent let go 135 tadpoles. To find out how many he kept, we can subtract the number he let go from the total number he caught: 180 - 135 = 45 Therefore, Trent kept 45 tadpoles. The answer is 45.\n\n\nQ: Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. If Mabel has 85 marbles, how many more marbles does Mabel have than Amanda?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Katrina has. We know that Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 85 marbles, so we can set up an equation: Mabel's marbles = 5 x Katrina's marbles 85 = 5 x Katrina's marbles Katrina's marbles = 17 Now we know that Katrina has 17 marbles. We also know that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. So we can set up another equation: Amanda's marbles = 2 x Katrina's marbles + 12 Amanda's marbles = 2 x 17 + 12 Amanda's marbles = 46 So Amanda has 46 marbles. Finally, we can figure out how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda: Mabel's marbles - Amanda's marbles = 85 - 46 Mabel's marbles - Amanda's marbles = 39 Therefore, Mabel has 39 more marbles than Amanda. The answer is 39.\n\n\n"
