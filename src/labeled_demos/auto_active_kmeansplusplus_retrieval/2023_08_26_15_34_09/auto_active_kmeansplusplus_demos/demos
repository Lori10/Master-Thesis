            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nRupert is younger than Vincent by 2 years, so he is 22 years old – 2 years = <<22-2=20>>20 years old.\nKhloe is 10 years younger than Rupert so she is 20 years old – 10 years = 10 years old.\nEugene is 3 times older than Khloe so he is 10 years old * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 years old.\nYorick is twice Eugene’s age so he is 30 years old * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 years old.\nAmilia is a quarter of Yorick’s age so she is 60 years old / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 years old.\nTricia is a third of Amilia’s age so she is 15 years old / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 years old.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nThe total amount of money saved is $9 + $5 = $<<9+5=14>>14.\nThe total cost of the frisbee and the puzzle is $4 + $3 = $<<4+3=7>>7.\nSo Oliver has $14 - $7 = $<<14-7=7>>7 left.\nHis friend gives him $8, so now he has $7 + $8 = $<<7+8=15>>15.",

The second statue weighed 18. The remaining two statues weighed the same amount. The marble he discarded after carving it off the statues weighed 22 pounds. How much did each of the remaining statues Hammond carved weigh?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nHammond’s statues weighed 80 - 22 = <<80-22=58>>58 pounds after the discarded marble was carved off.\nMinus the first statue, the statues weighed 58 - 10 = <<58-10=48>>48 pounds.\nMinus the second statue, the statues weighed 48 - 18 = <<48-18=30>>30 pounds.\nThe remaining two statues weighed the same amount, so each weighed 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 pounds.",

How much did the P.T.O. spend on shirts for field day?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nThe cost for 101 Kindergarten shirts x $5.80 = $<<101*5.80=585.80>>585.80.\nThe cost for 113 first grade shirts x $5 = $<<113*5=565>>565.\nThe cost for 107 second grade shirts x $5.60 = $<<107*5.60=599.20>>599.20.\nThe cost for 108 third grade shirts x $5.25 = $<<108*5.25=567>>567.\nThe total cost of the shirts was $585.80 + $565 + $599.20 + $567 = $<<585.8+565+599.2+567=2317>>2,317",
