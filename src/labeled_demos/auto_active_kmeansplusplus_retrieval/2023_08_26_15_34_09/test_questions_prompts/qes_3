  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Tricia is a third of Amilia\u2019s age and Amilia is a quarter of Yorick\u2019s age. Yorick is twice Eugene\u2019s age and Khloe is a third of Eugene\u2019s age. Rupert is 10 years older than Khloe but 2 years younger than Vincent who is 22 years old. How old, in years, is Tricia?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nRupert is younger than Vincent by 2 years, so he is 22 years old \u2013 2 years = <<22-2=20>>20 years old.\nKhloe is 10 years younger than Rupert so she is 20 years old \u2013 10 years = 10 years old.\nEugene is 3 times older than Khloe so he is 10 years old * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 years old.\nYorick is twice Eugene\u2019s age so he is 30 years old * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 years old.\nAmilia is a quarter of Yorick\u2019s age so she is 60 years old / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 years old.\nTricia is a third of Amilia\u2019s age so she is 15 years old / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 years old. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: A train takes 4 hours to reach a destination at a speed of 50 miles per hour. How long would it take if it traveled at 100 miles per hour instead?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe distance to the destination is 4 hours * 50 miles/hour = <<4*50=200>>200 miles.\nTraveling at 100 miles per hour, it will take 200 miles / (100 miles/hour) = <<200/(100)=2>>2 hours. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Oliver had $9, then he saved $5 from his allowance and spent $4 on a frisbee and $3 on a puzzle. His friend gives him another $8 as it's his birthday. How much money does Oliver have left?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe total amount of money saved is $9 + $5 = $<<9+5=14>>14.\nThe total cost of the frisbee and the puzzle is $4 + $3 = $<<4+3=7>>7.\nSo Oliver has $14 - $7 = $<<14-7=7>>7 left.\nHis friend gives him $8, so now he has $7 + $8 = $<<7+8=15>>15. The answer is 15.\n\n\n"
