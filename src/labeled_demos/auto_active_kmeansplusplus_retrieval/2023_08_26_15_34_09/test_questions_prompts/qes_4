  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A train takes 4 hours to reach a destination at a speed of 50 miles per hour. How long would it take if it traveled at 100 miles per hour instead?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe distance to the destination is 4 hours * 50 miles/hour = <<4*50=200>>200 miles.\nTraveling at 100 miles per hour, it will take 200 miles / (100 miles/hour) = <<200/(100)=2>>2 hours. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Hammond carves life-sized statues out of marble. His latest set of four statues started with an 80-pound block of marble. The first statue he carved weighed 10 pounds. The second statue weighed 18. The remaining two statues weighed the same amount. The marble he discarded after carving it off the statues weighed 22 pounds. How much did each of the remaining statues Hammond carved weigh?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nHammond\u2019s statues weighed 80 - 22 = <<80-22=58>>58 pounds after the discarded marble was carved off.\nMinus the first statue, the statues weighed 58 - 10 = <<58-10=48>>48 pounds.\nMinus the second statue, the statues weighed 48 - 18 = <<48-18=30>>30 pounds.\nThe remaining two statues weighed the same amount, so each weighed 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 pounds. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Tricia is a third of Amilia\u2019s age and Amilia is a quarter of Yorick\u2019s age. Yorick is twice Eugene\u2019s age and Khloe is a third of Eugene\u2019s age. Rupert is 10 years older than Khloe but 2 years younger than Vincent who is 22 years old. How old, in years, is Tricia?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nRupert is younger than Vincent by 2 years, so he is 22 years old \u2013 2 years = <<22-2=20>>20 years old.\nKhloe is 10 years younger than Rupert so she is 20 years old \u2013 10 years = 10 years old.\nEugene is 3 times older than Khloe so he is 10 years old * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 years old.\nYorick is twice Eugene\u2019s age so he is 30 years old * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 years old.\nAmilia is a quarter of Yorick\u2019s age so she is 60 years old / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 years old.\nTricia is a third of Amilia\u2019s age so she is 15 years old / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 years old. The answer is 5.\n\n\n"
