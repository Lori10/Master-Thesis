Cost of an orange is 1$. He want to buy same number of orange and apples. So how many apple and orange he would be able to buy in 100$? Answer Choices: (A) 10 apple an 10 oranges (B) 20 apple and 20 oranges (C) 27 apples and 27 oranges (D) 30 apple and 30 oranges (E) 34 apples and 34 oranges\nA: Let's think step by step.\nSince cost of an orange is 1$ and apple is 4 times costlier than orange so the cost of apple is 4$. Now if we add cost of an apple and orange it comes to be 5$ and hence if we divide 100 by 5 we get answer 20. So he will be able to buy 20 apple and 20 oranges. So option B is correct. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
