Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?

  "formatted_prompt": "Q: if cost of an apple is equal to cost of 4 oranges and he has 100$ with him. Cost of an orange is 1$. He want to buy same number of orange and apples. So how many apple and orange he would be able to buy in 100$? Answer Choices: (A) 10 apple an 10 oranges (B) 20 apple and 20 oranges (C) 27 apples and 27 oranges (D) 30 apple and 30 oranges (E) 34 apples and 34 oranges\nA: Let's think step by step.\nSince cost of an orange is 1$ and apple is 4 times costlier than orange so the cost of apple is 4$. Now if we add cost of an apple and orange it comes to be 5$ and hence if we divide 100 by 5 we get answer 20. So he will be able to buy 20 apple and 20 oranges. So option B is correct. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: The ratio of sum of squares of first n natural numbers to square of sum of first n natural numbers is 17:325. the value of n is Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 25 (C) 35 (D) 30 (E) none of these\nA: Let's think step by step.\nsum of 1st n natural no.s is n(n+1)/2,\nsum of sqaures of 1st n natural no.s is n(n+1)(2n+1)/6,\nThe ratio of sum of squares of first n natural numbers to square of sum of first n natural numbers=n(n+1)(2n+1)*2*2/(n*n*(n+1)*(n+1))\n=2(2n+1)/(3n(n+1))\nnow by hit and trial for the given options,if we put 25 then this will give 17/325\ntherefore the answer is 25\nANSWER:B The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If 6 Men or 7 Women take 6 days to complete some work, how many days will 10 Men and 6 Women working together take to complete the work?\nCan anyone explain please? Answer Choices: (A) 1. 3/2 days (B) 2. 2 Days (C) 3. 9/4 days (D) 4.5/2 days (E) 5.126/53 days\nA: Let's think step by step.\n6 men or 7 women takes 6 days to complete the work\nSo 6M = 7W\nW = 6/7M\n1 man in 1 day does 1 unit of work\nso 6 M in 6 M = 36 units of work\nnow 10 M and 6 W = 10 M + 6(6/7)M\n= 10M + 36M/7\n= 106M/7\nSince both set do the same work\n106M/7 in n Days = 36 units of work\nn = 36 *7/106 = 126/53 days.\nE The answer is E.\n\n\n"
