            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\n6 men or 7 women takes 6 days to complete the work\nSo 6M = 7W\nW = 6/7M\n1 man in 1 day does 1 unit of work\nso 6 M in 6 M = 36 units of work\nnow 10 M and 6 W = 10 M + 6(6/7)M\n= 10M + 36M/7\n= 106M/7\nSince both set do the same work\n106M/7 in n Days = 36 units of work\nn = 36 *7/106 = 126/53 days.\nE",

So how many apple and orange he would be able to buy in 100$? Answer Choices: (A) 10 apple an 10 oranges (B) 20 apple and 20 oranges (C) 27 apples and 27 oranges (D) 30 apple and 30 oranges (E) 34 apples and 34 oranges",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nSince cost of an orange is 1$ and apple is 4 times costlier than orange so the cost of apple is 4$. Now if we add cost of an apple and orange it comes to be 5$ and hence if we divide 100 by 5 we get answer 20. So he will be able to buy 20 apple and 20 oranges. So option B is correct.",
