  "test_question": "Q: Calvin is making soup for his family for dinner. He has a pot with enough soup to fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. He is an adult and will be eating with his adult wife and their two children. If everyone eats one bowl at a meal, how many times will each child be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: One serving of soup has 1 cup of vegetables and 2.5 cups of broth. How many pints of vegetables and broth combined would be needed for 8 servings?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total amount of soup in cups for 8 servings. One serving has 1 cup of vegetables and 2.5 cups of broth, so one serving of soup is 1 + 2.5 = 3.5 cups. To find the total amount of soup for 8 servings, we can multiply the amount for one serving by 8: 3.5 cups/serving x 8 servings = 28 cups of soup Now we need to find the amount of pints in 28 cups. There are 2 cups in a pint, so we can divide 28 cups by 2 to get the amount in pints: 28 cups \u00f7 2 cups/pint = 14 pints Therefore, we would need 14 pints of vegetables and broth combined for 8 servings of soup. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Mark is filling a punch bowl that can hold 16 gallons of punch. He fills it part way, then his cousin comes along and drinks half the punch in the bowl. Mark starts to refill the bowl and adds 4 more gallons, but then his friend Sally comes in and drinks 2 more gallons of punch. After that, Mark has to add 12 gallons of punch to completely fill the bowl. How much punch did Mark initially add to the bowl?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Mark fills the punch bowl part way, but we don't know how much he added yet. Let's call this amount \"x\". Then, his cousin drinks half the punch in the bowl, which means there is now only 8 gallons of punch left in the bowl. Mark starts to refill the bowl and adds 4 more gallons, so there are now 12 gallons of punch in the bowl. But then Sally comes in and drinks 2 more gallons of punch, so there are now only 10 gallons of punch in the bowl. Finally, Mark has to add 12 more gallons of punch to completely fill the bowl, which means the bowl can hold a total of 24 gallons of punch (16 gallons initially + 8 gallons left after cousin drank half). So, we can set up an equation to solve for x: x + 8 + 4 - 2 + 12 = 24 Simplifying, we get: x + 22 = 24 Subtracting 22 from both sides, we get: x = 2 Therefore, Mark initially added 2 gallons of punch to the bowl. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: To make fried green tomatoes, Thelma cuts each green tomato into 8 slices before cooking them up.  If 20 slices of fried green tomato make a meal for a single person, how many tomatoes will Thelma need to make enough fried green tomatoes to feed a family of 8 for a single meal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many slices of fried green tomatoes are needed for a family of 8 for a single meal. We know that 20 slices make a meal for a single person, so for 8 people, we need: 20 slices/person x 8 people = 160 slices Next, we need to figure out how many tomatoes are needed to make 160 slices. We know that Thelma cuts each tomato into 8 slices, so: 160 slices \u00f7 8 slices/tomato = 20 tomatoes Therefore, Thelma will need 20 tomatoes to make enough fried green tomatoes to feed a family of 8 for a single meal. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Timmy, Tommy and Tina are filling up a kiddie pool in their backyard.  Each has a pail they fill with water from a house before dumping it into the pool.  If Timmy's pail holds twice as much water as Tommy's, and Tommy's holds 2 gallons more than Tina's, and Tina's is 4 gallons, how much water do the three of them fill the pool with after 3 trips each?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much water each pail can hold. We know that Tina's pail holds 4 gallons. Tommy's pail holds 2 more gallons than Tina's, so it holds 4 + 2 = 6 gallons. Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's, so it holds 6 x 2 = 12 gallons. Now we know how much water each pail can hold, we can figure out how much water they can fill the pool with after 1 trip each. Together, they can fill the pool with 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 gallons of water. After 3 trips each, they will have filled the pool with 22 x 3 = 66 gallons of water. The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: A local restaurant is offering an 8 piece fried chicken bucket and 2 sides for $12.00 that will feed 6 people.  If Monty was having a family reunion for 36 family members, how much will it cost him to buy enough chicken and sides to feed everyone one serving?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many servings of chicken and sides Monty needs to feed 36 people. Since the restaurant's 8 piece fried chicken bucket feeds 6 people, we can calculate that Monty needs 6 buckets of chicken to feed 36 people. Next, we need to figure out how many sides Monty needs. The restaurant offers 2 sides with each 8 piece chicken bucket, so Monty needs 6 x 2 = 12 sides. Now, we can calculate the total cost. Monty is paying $12.00 for 6 people, so he needs to pay 6/6 = 1 dollar per person. To feed 36 people, Monty needs to pay 36 x 1 = $36.00 for the chicken and sides. The answer is 36.\n\n\nQ: Alex was having a cookout Friday night and planned to serve burgers to his guests.  He planned to cook 3 burgers for each guest and had invited 10 friends over.  1 of his friends didn't eat meat and said they would bring their own food.  Another one of his friends didn't eat bread and would not need the buns.  The burger buns came 8 to a pack.  How many packs of buns did Alex need to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many guests will be eating burgers. Alex invited 10 friends, but one won't be eating meat, so there will be 9 guests eating burgers. Next, we need to figure out how many burgers Alex will need to cook. He plans to cook 3 burgers for each guest, so he will need to cook 3 x 9 = 27 burgers. Now we need to figure out how many buns Alex will need. Each burger needs 2 buns, but one of his friends won't be eating the buns, so he will only need 2 x 26 = 52 buns. Since the buns come 8 to a pack, we need to divide 52 by 8 to find out how many packs of buns Alex needs to buy. 52 \u00f7 8 = 6.5 Since we can't buy half a pack of buns, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So Alex needs to buy 7 packs of buns. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Dani brings two and half dozen cupcakes for her 2nd-grade class.  There are 27 students (including Dani), 1 teacher, and 1 teacher\u2019s aid.  If 3 students called in sick that day, how many cupcakes are left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Dani brought in total. Two and a half dozen cupcakes is equal to 30 cupcakes (since a dozen is 12). Next, we need to figure out how many people will be receiving cupcakes. There are 27 students, 1 teacher, and 1 teacher's aid, for a total of 29 people. However, 3 students called in sick, so we need to subtract them from the total. 29 - 3 = 26 people receiving cupcakes. Now, we need to subtract 26 cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes Dani brought. 30 - 26 = 4 cupcakes left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Phill cuts the pizza in half, which gives him 2 slices. Then he cuts both halves in half, which gives him 4 slices. And then he cuts each slice in half again, which gives him 8 slices in total. Next, Phill passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends, which means he gives away 3 slices in total. He also passes out 2 slices to 2 of his friends, which means he gives away 4 slices in total. Therefore, Phill has given away a total of 7 slices of pizza. If he started with 8 slices, then he has 1 slice left for himself. The answer is 1.\n\n\n"
