  "test_question": "Q: When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes that she uses contains three tomatoes. Freda\u2019s last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce. How many tomatoes did Freda use?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: To make fried green tomatoes, Thelma cuts each green tomato into 8 slices before cooking them up.  If 20 slices of fried green tomato make a meal for a single person, how many tomatoes will Thelma need to make enough fried green tomatoes to feed a family of 8 for a single meal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many slices of fried green tomatoes are needed for a family of 8 for a single meal. We know that 20 slices make a meal for a single person, so for 8 people, we need: 20 slices/person x 8 people = 160 slices Next, we need to figure out how many tomatoes are needed to make 160 slices. We know that Thelma cuts each tomato into 8 slices, so: 160 slices \u00f7 8 slices/tomato = 20 tomatoes Therefore, Thelma will need 20 tomatoes to make enough fried green tomatoes to feed a family of 8 for a single meal. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: One serving of soup has 1 cup of vegetables and 2.5 cups of broth. How many pints of vegetables and broth combined would be needed for 8 servings?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total amount of soup in cups for 8 servings. One serving has 1 cup of vegetables and 2.5 cups of broth, so one serving of soup is 1 + 2.5 = 3.5 cups. To find the total amount of soup for 8 servings, we can multiply the amount for one serving by 8: 3.5 cups/serving x 8 servings = 28 cups of soup Now we need to find the amount of pints in 28 cups. There are 2 cups in a pint, so we can divide 28 cups by 2 to get the amount in pints: 28 cups \u00f7 2 cups/pint = 14 pints Therefore, we would need 14 pints of vegetables and broth combined for 8 servings of soup. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Timmy, Tommy and Tina are filling up a kiddie pool in their backyard.  Each has a pail they fill with water from a house before dumping it into the pool.  If Timmy's pail holds twice as much water as Tommy's, and Tommy's holds 2 gallons more than Tina's, and Tina's is 4 gallons, how much water do the three of them fill the pool with after 3 trips each?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much water each pail can hold. We know that Tina's pail holds 4 gallons. Tommy's pail holds 2 more gallons than Tina's, so it holds 4 + 2 = 6 gallons. Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's, so it holds 6 x 2 = 12 gallons. Now we know how much water each pail can hold, we can figure out how much water they can fill the pool with after 1 trip each. Together, they can fill the pool with 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 gallons of water. After 3 trips each, they will have filled the pool with 22 x 3 = 66 gallons of water. The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: Tim drinks 2 bottles that are each 1.5 quarts and an additional 20 ounces a day.  How much water does he drink a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the 1.5 quarts to ounces. 1 quart = 32 ounces So, 1.5 quarts = 1.5 x 32 = 48 ounces Tim drinks 2 bottles, so he drinks 2 x 48 = 96 ounces from the bottles. He also drinks an additional 20 ounces a day, so he drinks a total of 96 + 20 = 116 ounces a day. To find out how much he drinks in a week, we need to multiply 116 by 7 (the number of days in a week). 116 x 7 = 812 Therefore, Tim drinks 812 ounces of water in a week. The answer is 812.\n\n\nQ: Mark is filling a punch bowl that can hold 16 gallons of punch. He fills it part way, then his cousin comes along and drinks half the punch in the bowl. Mark starts to refill the bowl and adds 4 more gallons, but then his friend Sally comes in and drinks 2 more gallons of punch. After that, Mark has to add 12 gallons of punch to completely fill the bowl. How much punch did Mark initially add to the bowl?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Mark fills the punch bowl part way, but we don't know how much he added yet. Let's call this amount \"x\". Then, his cousin drinks half the punch in the bowl, which means there is now only 8 gallons of punch left in the bowl. Mark starts to refill the bowl and adds 4 more gallons, so there are now 12 gallons of punch in the bowl. But then Sally comes in and drinks 2 more gallons of punch, so there are now only 10 gallons of punch in the bowl. Finally, Mark has to add 12 more gallons of punch to completely fill the bowl, which means the bowl can hold a total of 24 gallons of punch (16 gallons initially + 8 gallons left after cousin drank half). So, we can set up an equation to solve for x: x + 8 + 4 - 2 + 12 = 24 Simplifying, we get: x + 22 = 24 Subtracting 22 from both sides, we get: x = 2 Therefore, Mark initially added 2 gallons of punch to the bowl. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Bertha started with two balls and gave one to her partner, so she has one ball left. Next, we need to figure out how many balls she loses and how many wear out. In 20 games, she loses 20/5 = 4 balls and 20/10 = 2 balls wear out. Finally, we need to figure out how many balls she buys. In 20 games, she buys 20/4 = 5 canisters of three balls, which is a total of 5*3 = 15 balls. So, in total, Bertha has 1 (starting ball) - 4 (lost balls) - 2 (worn out balls) + 15 (bought balls) = 10 tennis balls. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Dani brings two and half dozen cupcakes for her 2nd-grade class.  There are 27 students (including Dani), 1 teacher, and 1 teacher\u2019s aid.  If 3 students called in sick that day, how many cupcakes are left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Dani brought in total. Two and a half dozen cupcakes is equal to 30 cupcakes (since a dozen is 12). Next, we need to figure out how many people will be receiving cupcakes. There are 27 students, 1 teacher, and 1 teacher's aid, for a total of 29 people. However, 3 students called in sick, so we need to subtract them from the total. 29 - 3 = 26 people receiving cupcakes. Now, we need to subtract 26 cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes Dani brought. 30 - 26 = 4 cupcakes left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Betty and Dora started making some cupcakes at the same time. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour and Dora makes 8 every hour. If Betty took a two-hour break, what is the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Betty made in the first 3 hours before taking a break. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour, so in 3 hours, she would make: 10 cupcakes/hour x 3 hours = 30 cupcakes Next, we need to find out how many cupcakes Dora made in the same 5 hours. Dora makes 8 cupcakes every hour, so in 5 hours, she would make: 8 cupcakes/hour x 5 hours = 40 cupcakes Now we need to find the difference between the number of cupcakes they made. Betty made 30 cupcakes before taking a break, and Dora made 40 cupcakes in the same 5 hours. So the difference between the number of cupcakes they made is: 40 cupcakes - 30 cupcakes = 10 cupcakes Therefore, the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours is 10 cupcakes. The answer is 10.\n\n\n"
