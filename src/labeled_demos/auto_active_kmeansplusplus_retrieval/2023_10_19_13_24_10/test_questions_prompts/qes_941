  "test_question": "Q: An air conditioner cools a room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. The room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, then it was turned up to high for 4 hours. Afterward, it was turned off for 2 hours. How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Noah\u2019s bedroom light uses 6 watts per hour. His office light is much brighter so he can see to work and uses three times as much energy. The living room light has a much larger space to cover and has to be more powerful, so it uses four times as much energy as his bedroom light. If Noah leaves all those lights on for two hours, how many watts has he used?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many watts Noah's office light uses per hour. We know that it uses three times as much energy as his bedroom light, which is 6 watts per hour. So, the office light uses 3 x 6 = 18 watts per hour. Next, we need to find out how many watts the living room light uses per hour. We know that it uses four times as much energy as his bedroom light, which is 6 watts per hour. So, the living room light uses 4 x 6 = 24 watts per hour. Now that we know the wattage per hour for each light, we can calculate the total watts used by multiplying the wattage per hour by the number of hours the lights were on. In this case, the lights were on for two hours, so: - Noah's bedroom light used 6 watts per hour x 2 hours = 12 watts - Noah's office light used 18 watts per hour x 2 hours = 36 watts - The living room light used 24 watts per hour x 2 hours = 48 watts Therefore, the total watts used by all three lights is 12 + 36 + 48 = 96 watts. The answer is 96.\n\n\nQ: Betty and Dora started making some cupcakes at the same time. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour and Dora makes 8 every hour. If Betty took a two-hour break, what is the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Betty made in the first 3 hours before taking a break. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour, so in 3 hours, she would make: 10 cupcakes/hour x 3 hours = 30 cupcakes Next, we need to find out how many cupcakes Dora made in the same 5 hours. Dora makes 8 cupcakes every hour, so in 5 hours, she would make: 8 cupcakes/hour x 5 hours = 40 cupcakes Now we need to find the difference between the number of cupcakes they made. Betty made 30 cupcakes before taking a break, and Dora made 40 cupcakes in the same 5 hours. So the difference between the number of cupcakes they made is: 40 cupcakes - 30 cupcakes = 10 cupcakes Therefore, the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours is 10 cupcakes. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Carlos and Diego are racing around the block. Carlos runs around the entire block in 3 minutes. Diego runs around half the block in 2.5 minutes and then is tripped by a dog and can't finish. Assuming he kept up the same speed the entire race, what would've been the average time in seconds for the racers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Diego to run the entire block. Since he runs half the block in 2.5 minutes, we can use proportion to find out: 2.5 minutes = 1/2 block x minutes = 1 block Cross-multiplying, we get: 2.5 * 2 = x * 1 5 = x So it would take Diego 5 minutes to run the entire block if he hadn't been tripped. Now we can find the average time for the racers. We add up the time it took Carlos and the time it would've taken Diego, and divide by the number of racers: (3 minutes + 5 minutes) / 2 racers = 4 minutes But the question asks for the answer in seconds, so we need to convert minutes to seconds: 4 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 240 seconds So the average time for the racers would've been 240 seconds. The answer is 240.\n\n\nQ: John takes a 10-minute shower every other day for 4 weeks. If his shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute.  How much water does he use in those 4 weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many showers John takes in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks is 4 x 7 = 28 days. Since John takes a shower every other day, he takes 28/2 = 14 showers in 4 weeks. Next, we need to find out how much water he uses per shower. John takes a 10-minute shower, and his shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute. So, he uses 10 x 2 = 20 gallons of water per shower. Finally, we can find out how much water he uses in 4 weeks by multiplying the amount of water per shower by the number of showers he takes: 20 gallons per shower x 14 showers = 280 gallons of water in 4 weeks. Therefore, John uses 280 gallons of water in those 4 weeks. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Jill can run up a hill at 9 feet/second and down a hill at 12 feet/second. How long does it take her to run up and down a 900 foot hill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for Jill to run up the hill. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed The distance she runs up the hill is 900 feet, and her speed is 9 feet/second. So: time up = 900 / 9 = 100 seconds Next, we need to find the time it takes for Jill to run down the hill. Again, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed The distance she runs down the hill is also 900 feet, but her speed is 12 feet/second. So: time down = 900 / 12 = 75 seconds Finally, we need to find the total time it takes for Jill to run up and down the hill. Since she runs up and down separately, we can just add the two times: total time = time up + time down = 100 + 75 = 175 seconds Therefore, it takes Jill 175 seconds to run up and down a 900 foot hill. The answer is 900.\n\n\nQ: Gilbert, the bearded dragon, eats 4 crickets per week when the temperature averages 90 degrees F per day, but he eats twice as many crickets per week when the temperature averages 100 degrees F.  How many crickets will he eat over 15 weeks if the temperature averages 90 degrees F for 80% of the time, and 100 degrees F for the remainder of the time?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many weeks Gilbert will be eating 4 crickets per week. Since the temperature averages 90 degrees F for 80% of the time, that means he will be eating 4 crickets per week for 80% of 15 weeks, which is 12 weeks. Next, we need to find out how many weeks Gilbert will be eating twice as many crickets per week. Since the temperature averages 100 degrees F for the remaining 20% of the time, that means he will be eating twice as many crickets per week for 20% of 15 weeks, which is 3 weeks. Now we can calculate how many crickets Gilbert will eat in total. For the 12 weeks he eats 4 crickets per week, he will eat a total of 4 x 12 = 48 crickets. For the 3 weeks he eats twice as many crickets per week, he will eat a total of 2 x 4 = 8 crickets per week, or 8 x 3 = 24 crickets in total. Adding these two totals together, Gilbert will eat a total of 48 + 24 = 72 crickets over 15 weeks. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: There are four growing trees. The first tree grows 1 meter/day, the second grows the same amount in half the time, the third grows 2 meters/day, and the fourth tree grows a meter more than the third each day. How many meters did the trees grow in total in 4 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much the second tree grows per day. Since it grows the same amount as the first tree in half the time, it grows 2 meters/day. Now we can calculate how much each tree grows in 4 days: - The first tree grows 1 meter/day, so in 4 days it grows 4 meters. - The second tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The third tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The fourth tree grows 1 meter more than the third each day, so it grows 3 meters/day. In 4 days it grows 12 meters. Adding up the growth of all four trees, we get: 4 + 8 + 8 + 12 = 32 meters Therefore, the trees grew a total of 32 meters in 4 days. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: To get to an island called \"Virgo\", Tom needs to travel by plane and then by boat. The plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, and the boat trip takes up to 2 hours. In how many hours is Tom able to get to the \"Virgo\" island?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long the plane trip is. We know that the plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, so we can set up an equation: plane trip = 4 * boat trip Since we know the boat trip takes 2 hours, we can substitute that in: plane trip = 4 * 2 plane trip = 8 So the plane trip is 8 hours. Now we just need to add the plane trip and the boat trip together to find the total time: total time = plane trip + boat trip total time = 8 + 2 total time = 10 So Tom is able to get to the \"Virgo\" island in 10 hours. The answer is 10.\n\n\n"
