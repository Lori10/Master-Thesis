  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Mark is filling a punch bowl that can hold 16 gallons of punch. He fills it part way, then his cousin comes along and drinks half the punch in the bowl. Mark starts to refill the bowl and adds 4 more gallons, but then his friend Sally comes in and drinks 2 more gallons of punch. After that, Mark has to add 12 gallons of punch to completely fill the bowl. How much punch did Mark initially add to the bowl?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Mark fills the punch bowl part way, but we don't know how much he added yet. Let's call this amount \"x\". Then, his cousin drinks half the punch in the bowl, which means there is now only 8 gallons of punch left in the bowl. Mark starts to refill the bowl and adds 4 more gallons, so there are now 12 gallons of punch in the bowl. But then Sally comes in and drinks 2 more gallons of punch, so there are now only 10 gallons of punch in the bowl. Finally, Mark has to add 12 more gallons of punch to completely fill the bowl, which means the bowl can hold a total of 24 gallons of punch (16 gallons initially + 8 gallons left after cousin drank half). So, we can set up an equation to solve for x: x + 8 + 4 - 2 + 12 = 24 Simplifying, we get: x + 22 = 24 Subtracting 22 from both sides, we get: x = 2 Therefore, Mark initially added 2 gallons of punch to the bowl. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Tim drinks 2 bottles that are each 1.5 quarts and an additional 20 ounces a day.  How much water does he drink a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the 1.5 quarts to ounces. 1 quart = 32 ounces So, 1.5 quarts = 1.5 x 32 = 48 ounces Tim drinks 2 bottles, so he drinks 2 x 48 = 96 ounces from the bottles. He also drinks an additional 20 ounces a day, so he drinks a total of 96 + 20 = 116 ounces a day. To find out how much he drinks in a week, we need to multiply 116 by 7 (the number of days in a week). 116 x 7 = 812 Therefore, Tim drinks 812 ounces of water in a week. The answer is 812.\n\n\nQ: Timmy, Tommy and Tina are filling up a kiddie pool in their backyard.  Each has a pail they fill with water from a house before dumping it into the pool.  If Timmy's pail holds twice as much water as Tommy's, and Tommy's holds 2 gallons more than Tina's, and Tina's is 4 gallons, how much water do the three of them fill the pool with after 3 trips each?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much water each pail can hold. We know that Tina's pail holds 4 gallons. Tommy's pail holds 2 more gallons than Tina's, so it holds 4 + 2 = 6 gallons. Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's, so it holds 6 x 2 = 12 gallons. Now we know how much water each pail can hold, we can figure out how much water they can fill the pool with after 1 trip each. Together, they can fill the pool with 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 gallons of water. After 3 trips each, they will have filled the pool with 22 x 3 = 66 gallons of water. The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: A vampire needs to suck 7 gallons of blood per week to survive.  If he sucks 2 pints of blood per person, how many people does he need to suck each day to survive?\nA: Let's think step by step. 1 gallon = 8 pints (since 1 gallon = 128 fluid ounces and 1 fluid ounce = 0.125 pints) So, 7 gallons = 7 x 8 = 56 pints The vampire needs to suck 56 pints of blood per week to survive. 2 pints of blood per person To find out how many people the vampire needs to suck each day, we need to divide 56 by the number of days in a week (7). 56/7 = 8 Therefore, the vampire needs to suck blood from 8 people each day to survive. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: John takes a 10-minute shower every other day for 4 weeks. If his shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute.  How much water does he use in those 4 weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many showers John takes in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks is 4 x 7 = 28 days. Since John takes a shower every other day, he takes 28/2 = 14 showers in 4 weeks. Next, we need to find out how much water he uses per shower. John takes a 10-minute shower, and his shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute. So, he uses 10 x 2 = 20 gallons of water per shower. Finally, we can find out how much water he uses in 4 weeks by multiplying the amount of water per shower by the number of showers he takes: 20 gallons per shower x 14 showers = 280 gallons of water in 4 weeks. Therefore, John uses 280 gallons of water in those 4 weeks. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: One serving of soup has 1 cup of vegetables and 2.5 cups of broth. How many pints of vegetables and broth combined would be needed for 8 servings?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total amount of soup in cups for 8 servings. One serving has 1 cup of vegetables and 2.5 cups of broth, so one serving of soup is 1 + 2.5 = 3.5 cups. To find the total amount of soup for 8 servings, we can multiply the amount for one serving by 8: 3.5 cups/serving x 8 servings = 28 cups of soup Now we need to find the amount of pints in 28 cups. There are 2 cups in a pint, so we can divide 28 cups by 2 to get the amount in pints: 28 cups \u00f7 2 cups/pint = 14 pints Therefore, we would need 14 pints of vegetables and broth combined for 8 servings of soup. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many students are in Alice's class. We know that there are 40 students and 10 instructors, so the total number of people in the class is 40 + 10 = 50. Next, we need to figure out how many students are bringing their own life vests. We know that 20% of the students are bringing life vests, so we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of students by 0.2: 40 x 0.2 = 8. So 8 students are bringing their own life vests. Now we need to figure out how many life vests we still need. We have 20 life vests on hand, and we need one for each of the 50 people in the class. So we need 50 - 20 = 30 more life vests. However, we already know that 8 students are bringing their own life vests, so we can subtract those from the total number we need: 30 - 8 = 22. Therefore, Alice needs to get 22 more life vests so that the entire class has one. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Dani brings two and half dozen cupcakes for her 2nd-grade class.  There are 27 students (including Dani), 1 teacher, and 1 teacher\u2019s aid.  If 3 students called in sick that day, how many cupcakes are left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Dani brought in total. Two and a half dozen cupcakes is equal to 30 cupcakes (since a dozen is 12). Next, we need to figure out how many people will be receiving cupcakes. There are 27 students, 1 teacher, and 1 teacher's aid, for a total of 29 people. However, 3 students called in sick, so we need to subtract them from the total. 29 - 3 = 26 people receiving cupcakes. Now, we need to subtract 26 cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes Dani brought. 30 - 26 = 4 cupcakes left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class. The answer is 4.\n\n\n"
