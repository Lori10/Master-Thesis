  "test_question": "Q: Mrs. Jameson's bamboo in the backyard grows up to 30 inches a day. Today, its height is 20 feet. In how many days will its height be 600 inches?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: There are four growing trees. The first tree grows 1 meter/day, the second grows the same amount in half the time, the third grows 2 meters/day, and the fourth tree grows a meter more than the third each day. How many meters did the trees grow in total in 4 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much the second tree grows per day. Since it grows the same amount as the first tree in half the time, it grows 2 meters/day. Now we can calculate how much each tree grows in 4 days: - The first tree grows 1 meter/day, so in 4 days it grows 4 meters. - The second tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The third tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The fourth tree grows 1 meter more than the third each day, so it grows 3 meters/day. In 4 days it grows 12 meters. Adding up the growth of all four trees, we get: 4 + 8 + 8 + 12 = 32 meters Therefore, the trees grew a total of 32 meters in 4 days. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: James wants to build a ladder to climb a very tall tree.  Each rung of the ladder is 18 inches long and they are 6 inches apart.  If he needs to climb 50 feet how many feet of wood will he need for the rungs?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 50 feet to inches since the length of the rungs is given in inches. 50 feet = 600 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches) Next, we need to figure out how many rungs James will need. We know that each rung is 18 inches long and they are 6 inches apart. So, the total length of each \"rung + gap\" is 24 inches. To find the number of rungs, we can divide the total height of the ladder (600 inches) by the length of each \"rung + gap\" (24 inches). 600 inches \u00f7 24 inches = 25 rungs Finally, we can calculate the total length of wood needed for the rungs by multiplying the length of each rung (18 inches) by the number of rungs (25). 18 inches x 25 rungs = 450 inches To convert this back to feet, we divide by 12: 450 inches \u00f7 12 inches/foot = 37.5 feet So James will need 37.5 feet of wood for the rungs of his ladder. The answer is 38.\n\n\nQ: Xena is trying to outrun a dragon to get to the safety of a cave it's too big to fit into. Xena has a 600 foot head start, but the dragon can burn her if it gets within 120 feet of her. If Xena runs 15 feet per second and the dragon flies 30 feet per second, how many seconds does Xena have to get to the cave?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how fast the dragon can catch up to Xena. The dragon can cover 30 - 15 = 15 feet per second faster than Xena. Next, we need to find out how far the dragon needs to travel to catch up to Xena. This distance is 600 - 120 = 480 feet. Finally, we can use the formula distance = rate x time to find out how long Xena has to get to the cave. We can set up the equation as follows: 480 = 15t + 30t Simplifying the equation, we get: 480 = 45t Dividing both sides by 45, we get: t = 10.67 seconds Therefore, Xena has 10.67 seconds to get to the cave before the dragon catches up to her. The answer is 11.\n\n\nQ: James writes a comic every other day for 4 years. If there was no leap year, how many comics has he written?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days there are in 4 years. Since there are 365 days in a year, we can multiply 365 by 4 to get: 365 x 4 = 1460 days Next, we need to figure out how many comics James writes in every other day. Since he writes a comic every other day, we can divide the total number of days by 2 to get: 1460 / 2 = 730 comics Therefore, James has written 730 comics in 4 years if there was no leap year. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Patricia is growing her long very long to donate it to a charity that makes wigs for cancer survivors. Her hair is 14 inches long. She needs to donate 23 inches to make a wig. She wants her hair to be 12 inches long after the donation. How much longer does she have to grow her hair?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much hair Patricia needs to donate to reach the required 23 inches. 23 inches - 14 inches = 9 inches So, Patricia needs to grow her hair 9 more inches to reach the required length for donation. Next, we need to find out how much hair Patricia will have left after the donation. 14 inches - 9 inches = 5 inches So, Patricia will have 5 inches of hair left after the donation. Finally, we need to find out how much longer Patricia needs to grow her hair to reach her desired length of 12 inches. 12 inches - 5 inches = 7 inches Therefore, Patricia needs to grow her hair 7 more inches to reach her desired length after the donation. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Since 1989, Lily has treated herself to 1 hydrangea plant, each year.  Each plant costs $20.00.  By 2021, how much money has Lily spent on hydrangeas?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many years it has been since 1989 to 2021. 2021 - 1989 = 32 years So, Lily has been treating herself to 1 hydrangea plant every year for 32 years. Next, we need to find out how much money Lily has spent on hydrangeas. 1 plant costs $20.00, so: 32 years x $20.00 per plant = $640.00 Therefore, Lily has spent $640.00 on hydrangeas since 1989. The answer is 1989.\n\n\nQ: Jill can run up a hill at 9 feet/second and down a hill at 12 feet/second. How long does it take her to run up and down a 900 foot hill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for Jill to run up the hill. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed The distance she runs up the hill is 900 feet, and her speed is 9 feet/second. So: time up = 900 / 9 = 100 seconds Next, we need to find the time it takes for Jill to run down the hill. Again, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed The distance she runs down the hill is also 900 feet, but her speed is 12 feet/second. So: time down = 900 / 12 = 75 seconds Finally, we need to find the total time it takes for Jill to run up and down the hill. Since she runs up and down separately, we can just add the two times: total time = time up + time down = 100 + 75 = 175 seconds Therefore, it takes Jill 175 seconds to run up and down a 900 foot hill. The answer is 900.\n\n\n"
