  "test_question": "Q: Mr. Jackson\u2019s fourth-grade class has 27 students. He wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. The glue sticks come in packs of 8. How many packs will Mr. Jackson need to buy so every student can have 2 glue sticks, assuming he can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Dani brings two and half dozen cupcakes for her 2nd-grade class.  There are 27 students (including Dani), 1 teacher, and 1 teacher\u2019s aid.  If 3 students called in sick that day, how many cupcakes are left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Dani brought in total. Two and a half dozen cupcakes is equal to 30 cupcakes (since a dozen is 12). Next, we need to figure out how many people will be receiving cupcakes. There are 27 students, 1 teacher, and 1 teacher's aid, for a total of 29 people. However, 3 students called in sick, so we need to subtract them from the total. 29 - 3 = 26 people receiving cupcakes. Now, we need to subtract 26 cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes Dani brought. 30 - 26 = 4 cupcakes left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many students are in Alice's class. We know that there are 40 students and 10 instructors, so the total number of people in the class is 40 + 10 = 50. Next, we need to figure out how many students are bringing their own life vests. We know that 20% of the students are bringing life vests, so we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of students by 0.2: 40 x 0.2 = 8. So 8 students are bringing their own life vests. Now we need to figure out how many life vests we still need. We have 20 life vests on hand, and we need one for each of the 50 people in the class. So we need 50 - 20 = 30 more life vests. However, we already know that 8 students are bringing their own life vests, so we can subtract those from the total number we need: 30 - 8 = 22. Therefore, Alice needs to get 22 more life vests so that the entire class has one. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Seth bought some boxes of oranges. He gave a box to his mother. He then gave away half of the remaining boxes. If Seth has 4 boxes of oranges left, how many boxes did he buy in the first place?\nA: Let's think step by step. 1. Seth gave a box to his mother, so he had x-1 boxes left. 2. He then gave away half of the remaining boxes, which means he gave away (x-1)/2 boxes. 3. After giving away half of the remaining boxes, he had 4 boxes left. So, we can set up an equation: (x-1)/2 = x-4 4. Solving for x, we can simplify the equation: x-1 = 2(x-4) -> x-1 = 2x-8 -> x = 7 Therefore, Seth bought 7 boxes of oranges in the first place. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Nori had 4 boxes of crayons with 8 crayons in each box. She gave 5 crayons to Mae and also give some crayons to Lea. How many more crayons did she give to Lea than Mae if she has only 15 crayons left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many crayons Nori had in total. 4 boxes x 8 crayons per box = 32 crayons Next, we need to subtract the 5 crayons Nori gave to Mae. 32 crayons - 5 crayons = 27 crayons We know that Nori has 15 crayons left, so we can subtract that from the 27 crayons to find out how many crayons she gave to Lea. 27 crayons - 15 crayons = 12 crayons Therefore, Nori gave 12 crayons to Lea. To find out how many more crayons Nori gave to Lea than Mae, we can subtract the 5 crayons from Mae from the 12 crayons given to Lea. 12 crayons - 5 crayons = 7 crayons So Nori gave 7 more crayons to Lea than Mae. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Alex was having a cookout Friday night and planned to serve burgers to his guests.  He planned to cook 3 burgers for each guest and had invited 10 friends over.  1 of his friends didn't eat meat and said they would bring their own food.  Another one of his friends didn't eat bread and would not need the buns.  The burger buns came 8 to a pack.  How many packs of buns did Alex need to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many guests will be eating burgers. Alex invited 10 friends, but one won't be eating meat, so there will be 9 guests eating burgers. Next, we need to figure out how many burgers Alex will need to cook. He plans to cook 3 burgers for each guest, so he will need to cook 3 x 9 = 27 burgers. Now we need to figure out how many buns Alex will need. Each burger needs 2 buns, but one of his friends won't be eating the buns, so he will only need 2 x 26 = 52 buns. Since the buns come 8 to a pack, we need to divide 52 by 8 to find out how many packs of buns Alex needs to buy. 52 \u00f7 8 = 6.5 Since we can't buy half a pack of buns, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So Alex needs to buy 7 packs of buns. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Michael has $42. Michael gives away half the money to his brother. His brother then buys 3 dollars worth of candy. If his brother has $35 left, how much money, in dollars, did his brother have at first?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Michael had $42. Next, he gave away half of that money to his brother, which is $21. His brother then spent $3 on candy, leaving him with $35. To figure out how much money his brother had at first, we need to work backwards. If his brother had $35 after spending $3 on candy, then he had $38 before buying the candy. And if his brother received $21 from Michael, then he must have had $17 to begin with. Therefore, his brother had $17 at first. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Sally, Sam, and Steve went to play with their marbles. In the beginning, Sam has twice as many marbles as Steve while Sally has 5 less than Sam. After Sam has given Sally and Steve 3 marbles each, Sam has 8 marbles left. How many marbles does Steve have now?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Sam had in the beginning. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve, so let's call the number of marbles Steve had \"x\". This means that Sam had 2x marbles. Next, we know that Sally had 5 less marbles than Sam, so Sally had 2x - 5 marbles. After Sam gave 3 marbles each to Sally and Steve, he was left with 8 marbles. This means that he gave away a total of 6 marbles (3 to Sally and 3 to Steve), so he must have started with 14 marbles (8 + 6 = 14). Now we can use this information to figure out how many marbles Steve has. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve in the beginning, so if Sam had 14 marbles, Steve must have had 7 marbles (14 \u00f7 2 = 7). After Sam gave Steve 3 marbles, Steve now has 10 marbles (7 + 3 = 10). The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Jerry is sweeping up pieces of broken glass in the parking lot. He sweeps up 20 amber pieces, 35 green pieces, and some clear pieces. If the green pieces are 25% of the total glass he sweeps up, how many pieces were clear?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the green pieces are 25% of the total glass, so we can set up an equation: 35 = 0.25x where x is the total number of pieces of glass Jerry sweeps up. We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.25: x = 140 So Jerry sweeps up a total of 140 pieces of glass. We also know that he sweeps up 20 amber pieces and 35 green pieces, so the number of clear pieces must be: 140 - 20 - 35 = 85 Therefore, Jerry swept up 85 clear pieces of glass. The answer is 85.\n\n\n"
