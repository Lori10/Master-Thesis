  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Miriam currently has 30 marbles, but she used to have more. Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, gave her sister twice that amount and gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has. How many marbles did Miriam start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, so she now has 30 - 60 = -30 marbles. This doesn't make sense, so we know that Miriam must have started with more than 60 marbles. Next, we know that Miriam gave her sister twice the amount she gave her brother, so her sister received 2 * 60 = 120 marbles. We also know that Miriam gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has, so Savanna received 3 * 30 = 90 marbles. In total, Miriam gave away 60 + 120 + 90 = 270 marbles. If Miriam started with x marbles, we can set up the equation: x - 270 = 30 Solving for x, we get: x = 300 Therefore, Miriam started with 300 marbles. The answer is 300.\n\n\nQ: Aimee does a poll around her neighborhood and makes sure to get answers from 50% men and 50% women. She finds that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. How many people did she poll?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Aimee polled an equal number of men and women. Therefore, we can assume that 50% of the total number of people she polled are women. Let's call the total number of people she polled \"x\". Then, the number of women she polled is 0.5x. Next, we know that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. Therefore, the number of women in favor of this idea is 0.35(0.5x) = 0.175x. We also know that 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. Therefore, the number of women who did not support shortening the school day is 39. We can set up an equation to solve for x: 0.175x + 39 = 0.5x Simplifying this equation, we get: 39 = 0.325x x = 120 Therefore, Aimee polled 120 people in total. The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Sally, Sam, and Steve went to play with their marbles. In the beginning, Sam has twice as many marbles as Steve while Sally has 5 less than Sam. After Sam has given Sally and Steve 3 marbles each, Sam has 8 marbles left. How many marbles does Steve have now?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Sam had in the beginning. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve, so let's call the number of marbles Steve had \"x\". This means that Sam had 2x marbles. Next, we know that Sally had 5 less marbles than Sam, so Sally had 2x - 5 marbles. After Sam gave 3 marbles each to Sally and Steve, he was left with 8 marbles. This means that he gave away a total of 6 marbles (3 to Sally and 3 to Steve), so he must have started with 14 marbles (8 + 6 = 14). Now we can use this information to figure out how many marbles Steve has. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve in the beginning, so if Sam had 14 marbles, Steve must have had 7 marbles (14 \u00f7 2 = 7). After Sam gave Steve 3 marbles, Steve now has 10 marbles (7 + 3 = 10). The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Janice can type 6 sentences per minute. Today at work, Janice continued working on a paper she started typing yesterday. She typed for 20 minutes, took a break, and typed 15 minutes longer. She then had to erase 40 sentences she had typed incorrectly. After a meeting, she typed for 18 minutes more. In all, the paper had 536 sentences by the end of today. How many sentences did she start with today?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many sentences Janice typed in the first 20 minutes: 6 sentences/minute x 20 minutes = 120 sentences Next, let's find out how many sentences Janice typed in the additional 15 minutes: 6 sentences/minute x 15 minutes = 90 sentences Now, let's subtract the 40 sentences she had to erase: 120 sentences + 90 sentences - 40 sentences = 170 sentences So, Janice typed 170 sentences before the meeting. We know that the paper had 536 sentences by the end of the day, so we can subtract the 170 sentences Janice typed before the meeting to find out how many sentences she started with: 536 sentences - 170 sentences = 366 sentences Therefore, Janice started with 366 sentences today. The answer is 366.\n\n\nQ: Cleo and Ignacio placed 30 of their marbles in a jar on a Monday. They took 3/5 of the marbles from the jar the next day and divided them equally. On the third day, Cleo took 1/2 of the marbles remaining in the jars. How many marbles did Cleo have on the third day?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many marbles were taken from the jar on the second day. 3/5 of 30 marbles = (3/5) x 30 = 18 marbles So, 18 marbles were taken from the jar on the second day. Step 2: Find out how many marbles were left in the jar after the second day. 30 - 18 = 12 marbles So, 12 marbles were left in the jar after the second day. Step 3: Find out how many marbles Cleo took on the third day. 1/2 of 12 marbles = (1/2) x 12 = 6 marbles So, Cleo took 6 marbles on the third day. Step 4: Find out how many marbles Cleo had on the third day. Cleo had 6 marbles on the third day. Therefore, Cleo had 6 marbles on the third day. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Tracy has been collecting novels from her friends to donate to the Children For The Future charity organization. In the first week she collects a certain number of books. In the next five weeks, she collects ten times as many books as she did in the first week. How many books did she collect in the first week if she has 99 books now?\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that Tracy collected x number of books in the first week. According to the problem, in the next five weeks, she collected ten times as many books as she did in the first week. So, in the next five weeks, she collected 10x books. Therefore, the total number of books she collected is x + 10x = 11x. We also know that she has 99 books now. So, we can set up an equation: 11x = 99 To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 11: x = 9 Therefore, Tracy collected 9 books in the first week. The answer is 9.\n\n\n"
