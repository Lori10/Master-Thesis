  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Samuel is going to the cinema with his brother, Kevin. They both have a total budget of $20 for their outing. Samuel buys his $14 ticket, then spends $6 on drinks and food. Kevin buys his ticket, then spends $2 on drinks. They have both used their entire budget. How much did Kevin spend on food?\nA: Let's think step by step. Samuel spent $14 on his ticket and $6 on food and drinks, which means he spent a total of $20. This means that Kevin must have spent $0 on food and drinks, since they both used their entire budget of $20. Therefore, Kevin spent $6 on his ticket and $2 on drinks, which means he spent a total of $8. Since he didn't spend any money on food, the answer is $0. The answer is 0.\n\n\nQ: To get to an island called \"Virgo\", Tom needs to travel by plane and then by boat. The plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, and the boat trip takes up to 2 hours. In how many hours is Tom able to get to the \"Virgo\" island?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long the plane trip is. We know that the plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, so we can set up an equation: plane trip = 4 * boat trip Since we know the boat trip takes 2 hours, we can substitute that in: plane trip = 4 * 2 plane trip = 8 So the plane trip is 8 hours. Now we just need to add the plane trip and the boat trip together to find the total time: total time = plane trip + boat trip total time = 8 + 2 total time = 10 So Tom is able to get to the \"Virgo\" island in 10 hours. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Emery's family decides to travel for a weekend trip. They drive the first 100 miles in 1 hour. They stop at a McDonald's and then continue the rest of the journey for 300 miles. What's the total number of hours they traveled?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, they drove 100 miles in 1 hour. Then, they stopped at McDonald's, which we don't know how long it took. Finally, they continued the rest of the journey for 300 miles. So, the total distance they traveled is 100 + 300 = 400 miles. We know they drove the first 100 miles in 1 hour, but we don't know how long they stopped at McDonald's. Let's call that time \"x\". Then, they drove the remaining 300 miles. Let's call the time it took to drive that distance \"y\". So, the total time they traveled is: 1 hour (for the first 100 miles) + x (for the time they stopped at McDonald's) + y (for the remaining 300 miles) We don't know x or y, but we do know that the total time they traveled is the sum of those three values. Therefore, the answer is: Total time = 1 + x + y hours. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Grant spends $200.00 a year to have the newspaper delivered daily to his house.  Juanita buys the newspaper daily.  Monday through Saturday, she spends $0.50 and on Sunday she spends $2.00.  How much more money does Juanita spend buying the newspaper yearly than Grant?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper daily from Monday to Saturday: $0.50 x 6 = $3.00 Now, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper on Sundays: $2.00 x 1 = $2.00 Next, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper weekly: $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00 Finally, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper yearly: $5.00 x 52 = $260.00 Now, let's calculate the difference between what Juanita spends and what Grant spends: $260.00 - $200.00 = $60.00 Therefore, Juanita spends $60.00 more buying the newspaper yearly than Grant. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Jenny signs up for dinner theater with 5 of her friends. Each person pays $50 for the ticket and $10 for their entr\u00e9e, and half the people also buy unlimited drink tickets for $30/person. Then the dinner theater is canceled due to COVID, and each person gets a 90% refund. How much money did the group of six friends lose?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total cost per person. Each person pays $50 for the ticket and $10 for their entr\u00e9e, so the total cost per person is $50 + $10 = $60. Half of the people also buy unlimited drink tickets for $30/person, so three people buy drink tickets. The total cost per person for those who bought drink tickets is $60 + $30 = $90. Now we can calculate the total cost for the group of six friends. Since there are three people who bought drink tickets and three who didn't, we can calculate the total cost as follows: Total cost = (3 people x $90/person) + (3 people x $60/person) Total cost = $270 + $180 Total cost = $450 However, the dinner theater was canceled due to COVID, and each person gets a 90% refund. Therefore, the group of six friends will only get back 90% of the total cost, which is: Refund = 90% x $450 Refund = $405 Therefore, the group of six friends lost $450 - $405 = $45 in total. The answer is 45.\n\n\nQ: Maria wants to paint a picture and needs some tools to do that. She wants to buy a set of brushes for $20 and some canvas for three times more than the brushes. The paint costs Maria $8 per liter, and she needs at least 5 liters. How much money will she earn on the painting if she will be able to sell it for $200?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much Maria will spend on canvas. We know that the canvas will cost three times more than the brushes, which are $20. So, 3 x $20 = $60 for the canvas. Next, let's calculate how much Maria will spend on paint. She needs at least 5 liters, and each liter costs $8. So, 5 x $8 = $40 for the paint. Now, let's add up all of Maria's expenses: $20 for brushes + $60 for canvas + $40 for paint = $120 total expenses. If Maria sells the painting for $200, she will earn $200 - $120 = $80 profit. The answer is 80.\n\n\nQ: Each week Jaime saves $50. Every two weeks she spends $46 of her savings on a nice lunch with her mum. How long will it take her to save $135?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much money Jaime saves in a week after spending $46 every two weeks on lunch with her mom. In two weeks, Jaime spends $46 on lunch, so in one week, she spends $23 on lunch. Therefore, Jaime saves $50 - $23 = $27 per week. Next, we need to figure out how many weeks it will take Jaime to save $135. We can set up an equation: $27 per week x number of weeks = $135 To solve for the number of weeks, we can divide both sides by $27: number of weeks = $135 / $27 number of weeks = 5 Therefore, it will take Jaime 5 weeks to save $135. The answer is 135.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\n"
