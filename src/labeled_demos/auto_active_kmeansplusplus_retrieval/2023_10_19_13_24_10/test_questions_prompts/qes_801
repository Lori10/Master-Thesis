  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Peter and Kristin are to read 20 fantasy novels each in a week. Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin. If Peter reads one book in 18 hours, how long will Kristin read half of her books?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Peter to read one book. We know that he can read one book in 18 hours, so we can write: Peter's reading speed = 1 book / 18 hours Next, we need to find out how long it takes Kristin to read one book. We know that Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin, so we can write: Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * Peter's reading speed Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * (1 book / 18 hours) Kristin's reading speed = 1 book / 54 hours Now we can use Kristin's reading speed to find out how long it takes her to read half of her books. We know that she needs to read 20 books in a week, so she needs to read 10 books in half a week (3.5 days). We can write: Time to read 10 books = 10 books * (1 book / 54 hours) * (24 hours / 1 day) * (3.5 days) Time to read 10 books = 14 hours and 27 minutes Therefore, it will take Kristin 14 hours and 27 minutes to read half of her books. The answer is 27.\n\n\nQ: Carlos and Diego are racing around the block. Carlos runs around the entire block in 3 minutes. Diego runs around half the block in 2.5 minutes and then is tripped by a dog and can't finish. Assuming he kept up the same speed the entire race, what would've been the average time in seconds for the racers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Diego to run the entire block. Since he runs half the block in 2.5 minutes, we can use proportion to find out: 2.5 minutes = 1/2 block x minutes = 1 block Cross-multiplying, we get: 2.5 * 2 = x * 1 5 = x So it would take Diego 5 minutes to run the entire block if he hadn't been tripped. Now we can find the average time for the racers. We add up the time it took Carlos and the time it would've taken Diego, and divide by the number of racers: (3 minutes + 5 minutes) / 2 racers = 4 minutes But the question asks for the answer in seconds, so we need to convert minutes to seconds: 4 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 240 seconds So the average time for the racers would've been 240 seconds. The answer is 240.\n\n\nQ: Jessica just got her driving permit. She must complete 50 hours of driving with a parent to get her driver\u2019s license. It takes 20 minutes to drive to school. If she drives to and from school every day, how many school days will it take Jessica to meet the 50-hour driving requirement?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much time Jessica spends driving to and from school each day. She drives to school and back, so that's a total of 2 trips. Each trip takes 20 minutes, so she spends 40 minutes driving to and from school each day. Next, we need to figure out how many minutes of driving Jessica needs to complete in order to reach the 50-hour requirement. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 50 hours is equal to 50 x 60 = 3000 minutes. Now we can divide the total minutes of driving required by the number of minutes Jessica spends driving each day: 3000 / 40 = 75. So Jessica needs to drive for 75 school days in order to complete the 50-hour driving requirement. The answer is 50.\n\n\nQ: Some friends went hiking for 3.5 hours. They traveled 21 kilometers in that time. Birgit was 4 minutes/km faster than the average time. If Birgit kept the same pace, how many minutes would it take her to go 8 kilometers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the average speed of the group. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken: Average speed = distance/time = 21 km/3.5 hours = 6 km/hour Next, we need to find Birgit's speed. We know that she was 4 minutes/km faster than the average time, which means she completed each kilometer in (60-4) = 56 minutes. So her speed was: Birgit's speed = 1 km/56 minutes = 0.018 km/minute Finally, we need to find how long it would take Birgit to travel 8 kilometers at this speed. We can use the formula: Time = distance/speed Time = 8 km / 0.018 km/minute = 444.44 minutes So it would take Birgit approximately 444.44 minutes to travel 8 kilometers at the same pace. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Gina chooses what she and her sister will watch on Netflix three times as often as her sister does. If her sister watches a total of 24 shows on Netflix per week, and each show is 50 minutes long, how many minutes of Netflix does Gina get to choose?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how often Gina chooses what they watch compared to her sister. We know that Gina chooses three times as often as her sister, so if her sister watches 24 shows per week, Gina chooses what they watch 3 times that amount, or 3 x 24 = 72 times per week. Next, we need to figure out how many minutes of Netflix each person gets to choose. We know that each show is 50 minutes long, so if Gina chooses 72 shows per week, she gets to choose 72 x 50 = 3600 minutes of Netflix per week. Therefore, Gina gets to choose 3600 minutes of Netflix per week. The answer is 3600.\n\n\nQ: Janice can type 6 sentences per minute. Today at work, Janice continued working on a paper she started typing yesterday. She typed for 20 minutes, took a break, and typed 15 minutes longer. She then had to erase 40 sentences she had typed incorrectly. After a meeting, she typed for 18 minutes more. In all, the paper had 536 sentences by the end of today. How many sentences did she start with today?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many sentences Janice typed in the first 20 minutes: 6 sentences/minute x 20 minutes = 120 sentences Next, let's find out how many sentences Janice typed in the additional 15 minutes: 6 sentences/minute x 15 minutes = 90 sentences Now, let's subtract the 40 sentences she had to erase: 120 sentences + 90 sentences - 40 sentences = 170 sentences So, Janice typed 170 sentences before the meeting. We know that the paper had 536 sentences by the end of the day, so we can subtract the 170 sentences Janice typed before the meeting to find out how many sentences she started with: 536 sentences - 170 sentences = 366 sentences Therefore, Janice started with 366 sentences today. The answer is 366.\n\n\nQ: Jill can run up a hill at 9 feet/second and down a hill at 12 feet/second. How long does it take her to run up and down a 900 foot hill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for Jill to run up the hill. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed The distance she runs up the hill is 900 feet, and her speed is 9 feet/second. So: time up = 900 / 9 = 100 seconds Next, we need to find the time it takes for Jill to run down the hill. Again, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed The distance she runs down the hill is also 900 feet, but her speed is 12 feet/second. So: time down = 900 / 12 = 75 seconds Finally, we need to find the total time it takes for Jill to run up and down the hill. Since she runs up and down separately, we can just add the two times: total time = time up + time down = 100 + 75 = 175 seconds Therefore, it takes Jill 175 seconds to run up and down a 900 foot hill. The answer is 900.\n\n\nQ: Stella and Twinkle are filling up a truck with a capacity of 6000 stone blocks at the rate of 250 blocks per hour per person. They work for four hours and are then joined by 6 other people who also work at the same rate. How many hours did filling the truck take?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many blocks Stella and Twinkle can fill in 4 hours. 250 blocks per hour per person x 2 people x 4 hours = 2000 blocks So, after 4 hours, Stella and Twinkle have filled 2000 blocks. Next, we need to find out how many blocks all 8 people can fill in one hour. 250 blocks per hour per person x 8 people = 2000 blocks So, all 8 people can fill 2000 blocks in one hour. Now, we need to find out how many more blocks they need to fill to reach the capacity of 6000 blocks. 6000 blocks - 2000 blocks = 4000 blocks Finally, we can use the rate of 2000 blocks per hour for all 8 people to find out how many hours it will take to fill the remaining 4000 blocks. 4000 blocks \u00f7 2000 blocks per hour = 2 hours Therefore, filling the truck took a total of 4 + 2 = 6 hours. The answer is 6.\n\n\n"
