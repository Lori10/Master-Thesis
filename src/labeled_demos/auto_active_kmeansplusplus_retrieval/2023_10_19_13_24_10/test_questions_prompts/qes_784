  "test_question": "Q: At 8:00, 5000 people lined up at a polling station to cast their vote on election day. By midday 2/5 of the people had voted and by 16:00 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. What's the number of those who had not voted by 16:00?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Nine hundred tickets were sold to a concert. Three-fourths of those who bought the ticket came before the start of the concert. Five-ninths of the remaining came few minutes after the first song. Eighty people arrived during the middle part of the concert while the rest did not go. How many of those who bought the tickets did not go?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many people came before the start of the concert. Three-fourths of 900 tickets = (3/4) x 900 = 675 people came before the start of the concert. Step 2: Find out how many people were left after the first group came. 900 - 675 = 225 people were left. Step 3: Find out how many people came few minutes after the first song. Five-ninths of the remaining 225 people = (5/9) x 225 = 125 people came few minutes after the first song. Step 4: Find out how many people were left after the second group came. 225 - 125 = 100 people were left. Step 5: Subtract the number of people who arrived during the middle part of the concert from the number of people left. 100 - 80 = 20 people did not go to the concert. Therefore, 20 people who bought the tickets did not go to the concert. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Aimee does a poll around her neighborhood and makes sure to get answers from 50% men and 50% women. She finds that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. How many people did she poll?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Aimee polled an equal number of men and women. Therefore, we can assume that 50% of the total number of people she polled are women. Let's call the total number of people she polled \"x\". Then, the number of women she polled is 0.5x. Next, we know that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. Therefore, the number of women in favor of this idea is 0.35(0.5x) = 0.175x. We also know that 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. Therefore, the number of women who did not support shortening the school day is 39. We can set up an equation to solve for x: 0.175x + 39 = 0.5x Simplifying this equation, we get: 39 = 0.325x x = 120 Therefore, Aimee polled 120 people in total. The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: Cleo and Ignacio placed 30 of their marbles in a jar on a Monday. They took 3/5 of the marbles from the jar the next day and divided them equally. On the third day, Cleo took 1/2 of the marbles remaining in the jars. How many marbles did Cleo have on the third day?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many marbles were taken from the jar on the second day. 3/5 of 30 marbles = (3/5) x 30 = 18 marbles So, 18 marbles were taken from the jar on the second day. Step 2: Find out how many marbles were left in the jar after the second day. 30 - 18 = 12 marbles So, 12 marbles were left in the jar after the second day. Step 3: Find out how many marbles Cleo took on the third day. 1/2 of 12 marbles = (1/2) x 12 = 6 marbles So, Cleo took 6 marbles on the third day. Step 4: Find out how many marbles Cleo had on the third day. Cleo had 6 marbles on the third day. Therefore, Cleo had 6 marbles on the third day. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: A soccer team had 24 players prepared for a soccer game. The first half saw 11 players start the game with 2 substitutions made. In the second half, the team made twice as many substitutions as it made in the first half. How many players on the team did not play that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many players played in the first half. We know that 11 players started the game, and 2 substitutions were made, so a total of 13 players played in the first half. Next, we need to find out how many substitutions were made in the second half. We know that the team made twice as many substitutions as it made in the first half, so that means 2 x 2 = 4 substitutions were made in the second half. Now we can calculate how many players played in the second half. We know that there were 13 players who played in the first half, and 4 substitutions were made, so a total of 17 players played in the second half. Finally, we can calculate how many players did not play that day. We know that the team had 24 players prepared for the game, and 13 players played in the first half, and 17 players played in the second half. So, 24 - 13 - 17 = 4 players did not play that day. Therefore, there were 4 players on the team who did not play that day. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: In a school, the number of participants in the 2018 Science Quiz Bowl was 150. There were 20 more than twice the number of participants in 2019 as there were in 2018. In 2020, the number of participants was 40 less than half the number of participants in 2019. How many more participants were there in 2019 than in 2020?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many participants there were in 2019. We know that there were 20 more than twice the number of participants in 2018, so we can set up an equation: 2019 participants = 20 + 2 * 2018 participants 2019 participants = 20 + 2 * 150 2019 participants = 320 Next, we need to find out how many participants there were in 2020. We know that the number of participants in 2020 was 40 less than half the number of participants in 2019, so we can set up another equation: 2020 participants = 0.5 * 2019 participants - 40 2020 participants = 0.5 * 320 - 40 2020 participants = 80 Finally, we can find out how many more participants there were in 2019 than in 2020: 2019 participants - 2020 participants = 320 - 80 = 240 Therefore, there were 240 more participants in 2019 than in 2020. The answer is 2020.\n\n\nQ: Janice can type 6 sentences per minute. Today at work, Janice continued working on a paper she started typing yesterday. She typed for 20 minutes, took a break, and typed 15 minutes longer. She then had to erase 40 sentences she had typed incorrectly. After a meeting, she typed for 18 minutes more. In all, the paper had 536 sentences by the end of today. How many sentences did she start with today?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many sentences Janice typed in the first 20 minutes: 6 sentences/minute x 20 minutes = 120 sentences Next, let's find out how many sentences Janice typed in the additional 15 minutes: 6 sentences/minute x 15 minutes = 90 sentences Now, let's subtract the 40 sentences she had to erase: 120 sentences + 90 sentences - 40 sentences = 170 sentences So, Janice typed 170 sentences before the meeting. We know that the paper had 536 sentences by the end of the day, so we can subtract the 170 sentences Janice typed before the meeting to find out how many sentences she started with: 536 sentences - 170 sentences = 366 sentences Therefore, Janice started with 366 sentences today. The answer is 366.\n\n\nQ: Betty and Dora started making some cupcakes at the same time. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour and Dora makes 8 every hour. If Betty took a two-hour break, what is the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Betty made in the first 3 hours before taking a break. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour, so in 3 hours, she would make: 10 cupcakes/hour x 3 hours = 30 cupcakes Next, we need to find out how many cupcakes Dora made in the same 5 hours. Dora makes 8 cupcakes every hour, so in 5 hours, she would make: 8 cupcakes/hour x 5 hours = 40 cupcakes Now we need to find the difference between the number of cupcakes they made. Betty made 30 cupcakes before taking a break, and Dora made 40 cupcakes in the same 5 hours. So the difference between the number of cupcakes they made is: 40 cupcakes - 30 cupcakes = 10 cupcakes Therefore, the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours is 10 cupcakes. The answer is 10.\n\n\n"
