  "test_question": "Q: Elijah has one dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory\u2019s dog and another dog that is half the weight of Kory\u2019s dog. If Kory\u2019s dog is 60 pounds, how much do Elijah and Kory\u2019s dogs weigh altogether, in pounds?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Parker went to the gym and found 4 twenty pounds dumbbells set up for weightlifting. He added two more dumbbells to the setup and started his exercises. How many pounds of dumbbells is Parker using for his exercises?\nA: Let's think step by step. Parker started with 4 twenty pounds dumbbells, which means he was using 4 x 20 = 80 pounds of dumbbells for his exercises. Then he added two more dumbbells, but we don't know how much each of them weighs. Let's call the weight of each new dumbbell \"x\". So now Parker is using a total of (4 + 2) dumbbells, which is 6 dumbbells in total. The weight of each dumbbell is either 20 pounds (the original ones) or x pounds (the new ones). Therefore, the total weight of dumbbells that Parker is using for his exercises is: 80 + 2x We don't know the value of x, so we can't calculate the exact weight. But we do know that it's at least 20 pounds (since the original dumbbells were 20 pounds each). The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Joy fosters dogs.  The mom foster dog eats 1.5 cups of food, three times a day.  The puppies each eat 1/2 cup of food, twice a day.  There are 5 puppies.  How much food will Joy need for the next 6 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much food the mom foster dog eats in one day: 1.5 cups x 3 = 4.5 cups/day Next, let's calculate how much food one puppy eats in one day: 0.5 cups x 2 = 1 cup/day Since there are 5 puppies, they eat a total of: 5 x 1 = 5 cups/day To calculate how much food Joy needs for 6 days, we need to multiply the daily amount of food by 6: Mom foster dog: 4.5 cups/day x 6 days = 27 cups Puppies: 5 cups/day x 6 days = 30 cups Therefore, Joy will need a total of 27 + 30 = 57 cups of food for the next 6 days. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: James has five huskies, two pitbulls and four golden retrievers, all female. They became pregnant and each golden retriever had two more pups than each husky. If the huskies and pitbulls had 3 pups each, How many more pups than adult dogs are there in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many golden retriever pups were born. We know that each golden retriever had two more pups than each husky, so if the huskies had 3 pups each, then the golden retrievers had 3+2=5 pups each. So, the total number of golden retriever pups is 5 x 4 = 20. The huskies and pitbulls had 3 pups each, so the total number of husky and pitbull pups is (5+2) x 3 = 21. Therefore, the total number of pups is 20 + 21 = 41. There were 11 adult dogs (5 huskies + 2 pitbulls + 4 golden retrievers), so there are 41 - 11 = 30 more pups than adult dogs. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of 18 watermelons. Since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, the total weight of 18 watermelons would be: 23 x 18 = 414 pounds Next, we need to find the total amount of money Farmer Kent would make by selling these watermelons. Since he sells them for $2 a pound, we can multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 414 x $2 = $828 Therefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Giselle had 20 female doves in a birdhouse. After a month, the doves laid 3 eggs each. If 3/4 of the eggs hatched, calculate the total number of doves Giselle has now.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many eggs were laid in total. Since each dove laid 3 eggs, we can multiply the number of doves by 3: 20 doves x 3 eggs/dove = 60 eggs Next, we need to find out how many of those eggs hatched. We know that 3/4 of the eggs hatched, so we can multiply the total number of eggs by 3/4: 60 eggs x 3/4 = 45 eggs hatched Finally, we need to add the number of original doves (20) to the number of hatched eggs (45) to find the total number of doves: 20 doves + 45 doves = 65 doves Therefore, Giselle now has 65 doves. The answer is 65.\n\n\nQ: Jeff has a shelter where he currently takes care of 20 cats. On Monday he found 2 kittens in a box and took them to the shelter. On Tuesday he found 1 more cat with a leg injury. On Wednesday 3 people adopted 2 cats each. How many cats does Jeff currently have in his shelter?\nA: Let's think step by step. Jeff had 20 cats in his shelter. On Monday he found 2 kittens and took them to the shelter, so he now has 20 + 2 = 22 cats. On Tuesday he found 1 more cat with a leg injury, so he now has 22 + 1 = 23 cats. On Wednesday, 3 people adopted 2 cats each, which means a total of 3 x 2 = 6 cats were adopted. Therefore, Jeff currently has 23 - 6 = 17 cats in his shelter. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Yvonne swims 10 laps in 5 minutes.  Her younger sister can swim half as many laps as Yvonne in the same time frame.  Their brother Joel can swim three times the number of laps as the youngest sister.  How many laps can Joel swim?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many laps Yvonne's younger sister can swim in 5 minutes. Since she can swim half as many laps as Yvonne, we can divide Yvonne's number of laps by 2: Yvonne's sister = 10 laps / 2 = 5 laps Next, we need to figure out how many laps Joel can swim. We know that he can swim three times the number of laps as the youngest sister, so we can multiply her number of laps by 3: Joel = 5 laps * 3 = 15 laps Therefore, Joel can swim 15 laps in 5 minutes. The answer is 5.\n\n\n"
