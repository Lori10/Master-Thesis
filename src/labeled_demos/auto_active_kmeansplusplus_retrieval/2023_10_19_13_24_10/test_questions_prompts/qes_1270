  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Frank's laundry detergent is double concentrated and will wash 80 loads of laundry.  His detergent is usually $25.00 a bottle but they're having a sale.  If he buys 2 bottles, both bottles will drop to $20.00 a bottle.  How much does he spend, in cents, per load of laundry, if he buys 2 bottles of detergent?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the cost of one bottle of detergent during the sale: $25.00 - $20.00 = $5.00 discount per bottle $25.00 - $5.00 = $20.00 per bottle during the sale Since Frank buys 2 bottles during the sale, he spends: 2 bottles x $20.00 per bottle = $40.00 Now, let's calculate the cost per load of laundry: $40.00 for 2 bottles x 80 loads per bottle = 160 loads $40.00 for 160 loads = $0.25 per load Therefore, Frank spends 25 cents per load of laundry if he buys 2 bottles of detergent during the sale. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Janet buys 45-pound containers of cat litter for $21 each.  If her cat litter box holds 15 pounds of cat litter, and she changes out the litter weekly, how much will it cost, in dollars, for her to buy enough litter to last 210 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much cat litter Janet needs for 210 days. Since she changes the litter weekly, we need to multiply the amount of litter she uses in a week by the number of weeks in 210 days. Number of weeks in 210 days = 210/7 = 30 weeks Amount of litter used in a week = 15 pounds Amount of litter needed for 210 days = 15 pounds/week x 30 weeks = 450 pounds Next, we need to figure out how many 45-pound containers of cat litter Janet needs to buy to get 450 pounds of litter. Number of 45-pound containers needed = 450 pounds/45 pounds/container = 10 containers Finally, we can calculate the total cost of the cat litter. Cost of one 45-pound container = $21 Total cost of 10 containers = $21/container x 10 containers = $210 Therefore, it will cost Janet $210 to buy enough cat litter to last 210 days. The answer is 210.\n\n\nQ: John takes a 10-minute shower every other day for 4 weeks. If his shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute.  How much water does he use in those 4 weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many showers John takes in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks is 4 x 7 = 28 days. Since John takes a shower every other day, he takes 28/2 = 14 showers in 4 weeks. Next, we need to find out how much water he uses per shower. John takes a 10-minute shower, and his shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute. So, he uses 10 x 2 = 20 gallons of water per shower. Finally, we can find out how much water he uses in 4 weeks by multiplying the amount of water per shower by the number of showers he takes: 20 gallons per shower x 14 showers = 280 gallons of water in 4 weeks. Therefore, John uses 280 gallons of water in those 4 weeks. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Maria wants to paint a picture and needs some tools to do that. She wants to buy a set of brushes for $20 and some canvas for three times more than the brushes. The paint costs Maria $8 per liter, and she needs at least 5 liters. How much money will she earn on the painting if she will be able to sell it for $200?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much Maria will spend on canvas. We know that the canvas will cost three times more than the brushes, which are $20. So, 3 x $20 = $60 for the canvas. Next, let's calculate how much Maria will spend on paint. She needs at least 5 liters, and each liter costs $8. So, 5 x $8 = $40 for the paint. Now, let's add up all of Maria's expenses: $20 for brushes + $60 for canvas + $40 for paint = $120 total expenses. If Maria sells the painting for $200, she will earn $200 - $120 = $80 profit. The answer is 80.\n\n\nQ: A gallon of whole milk that normally costs $3 is now sold at $2. A box of cereal was sold at a discount of $1. How much will you save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the discount for each gallon of whole milk. The discount is $3 - $2 = $1 per gallon. So, if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk, you will save 3 x $1 = $3. Next, let's calculate the discount for each box of cereal. The discount is $1 per box. So, if you buy 5 boxes of cereal, you will save 5 x $1 = $5. Therefore, the total amount you will save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal is $3 + $5 = $8. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Each week Jaime saves $50. Every two weeks she spends $46 of her savings on a nice lunch with her mum. How long will it take her to save $135?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much money Jaime saves in a week after spending $46 every two weeks on lunch with her mom. In two weeks, Jaime spends $46 on lunch, so in one week, she spends $23 on lunch. Therefore, Jaime saves $50 - $23 = $27 per week. Next, we need to figure out how many weeks it will take Jaime to save $135. We can set up an equation: $27 per week x number of weeks = $135 To solve for the number of weeks, we can divide both sides by $27: number of weeks = $135 / $27 number of weeks = 5 Therefore, it will take Jaime 5 weeks to save $135. The answer is 135.\n\n\nQ: Tim drinks 2 bottles that are each 1.5 quarts and an additional 20 ounces a day.  How much water does he drink a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the 1.5 quarts to ounces. 1 quart = 32 ounces So, 1.5 quarts = 1.5 x 32 = 48 ounces Tim drinks 2 bottles, so he drinks 2 x 48 = 96 ounces from the bottles. He also drinks an additional 20 ounces a day, so he drinks a total of 96 + 20 = 116 ounces a day. To find out how much he drinks in a week, we need to multiply 116 by 7 (the number of days in a week). 116 x 7 = 812 Therefore, Tim drinks 812 ounces of water in a week. The answer is 812.\n\n\nQ: Grant spends $200.00 a year to have the newspaper delivered daily to his house.  Juanita buys the newspaper daily.  Monday through Saturday, she spends $0.50 and on Sunday she spends $2.00.  How much more money does Juanita spend buying the newspaper yearly than Grant?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper daily from Monday to Saturday: $0.50 x 6 = $3.00 Now, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper on Sundays: $2.00 x 1 = $2.00 Next, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper weekly: $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00 Finally, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper yearly: $5.00 x 52 = $260.00 Now, let's calculate the difference between what Juanita spends and what Grant spends: $260.00 - $200.00 = $60.00 Therefore, Juanita spends $60.00 more buying the newspaper yearly than Grant. The answer is 60.\n\n\n"
