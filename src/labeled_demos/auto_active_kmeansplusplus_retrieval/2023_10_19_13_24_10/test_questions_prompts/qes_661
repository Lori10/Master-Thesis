  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Martha needs 4 cups of berries and 2 cups of heavy cream to make 1 quart of ice cream.  She wants to make 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream.  At the farmers market, the 2 cup packages of strawberries are $3.00 each and the 2 cup package of raspberries are $5.00 each.  The heavy cream is sold for $4.00 for a 4 cup container.  How much will it cost her to make 1 quart of each ice cream?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how many packages of strawberries and raspberries Martha needs to make 1 quart of each ice cream. Since she needs 4 cups of berries for 1 quart of ice cream, and each package contains 2 cups, she will need 2 packages of strawberries and 2 packages of raspberries for both quarts of ice cream. The cost of the strawberries will be 2 packages x $3.00 per package = $6.00 for 1 quart of strawberry ice cream. The cost of the raspberries will be 2 packages x $5.00 per package = $10.00 for 1 quart of raspberry ice cream. Next, we need to calculate the cost of the heavy cream. Martha needs 2 cups of heavy cream for 1 quart of ice cream, so she will need 4 cups of heavy cream for both quarts of ice cream. The cost of the heavy cream is $4.00 for a 4 cup container, so it will cost $4.00 for both quarts of ice cream. Therefore, the total cost of making 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream is: $6.00 (strawberries) + $10.00 (raspberries) + $4.00 (heavy cream) = $20.00 The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of 18 watermelons. Since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, the total weight of 18 watermelons would be: 23 x 18 = 414 pounds Next, we need to find the total amount of money Farmer Kent would make by selling these watermelons. Since he sells them for $2 a pound, we can multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 414 x $2 = $828 Therefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Fran\u00e7oise sells pots of lily of the valley to fund humanitarian work. She buys them at \u20ac12 each and sells them at a 25% higher cost. How much will she give back to the association by selling 150 pots of lily of the valley?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the selling price of each pot of lily of the valley. Fran\u00e7oise sells them at a 25% higher cost than the buying price of \u20ac12, so we need to add 25% of \u20ac12 to \u20ac12: 25% of \u20ac12 = 0.25 x \u20ac12 = \u20ac3 Selling price = \u20ac12 + \u20ac3 = \u20ac15 Now we know that Fran\u00e7oise sells each pot of lily of the valley for \u20ac15. To calculate how much she will give back to the association by selling 150 pots, we need to multiply the selling price by the number of pots sold: \u20ac15 x 150 = \u20ac2250 Therefore, Fran\u00e7oise will give back \u20ac2250 to the association by selling 150 pots of lily of the valley. The answer is 150.\n\n\nQ: Five people are planning a party. Sonja will buy a loaf of French bread ($3 a loaf) and a platter of cold cuts ($23). Barbara will buy the soda ($1 per person) and two boxes of crackers ($2 per box). Mario and Rick will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles ($3 per package). Danica will supply a package of paper plates for $4. How much more will Sonja spend than the rest of the office put together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of Barbara's contribution. She will buy soda for 5 people, which will cost $5 (1 dollar per person). She will also buy two boxes of crackers, which will cost $4 (2 dollars per box). Therefore, Barbara's total contribution will be $9. Next, let's calculate the total cost of Mario and Rick's contribution. They will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles, which will cost $6 in total (3 dollars per package). Now, let's add up the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's. Barbara's contribution is $9, Mario and Rick's contribution is $6, and Danica's contribution is $4. Therefore, the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's is $19. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of Sonja's contribution. She will buy a loaf of French bread for $3 and a platter of cold cuts for $23. Therefore, Sonja's total contribution will be $26. To find out how much more Sonja will spend than the rest of the office put together, we need to subtract the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's from Sonja's total contribution. $26 (Sonja's contribution) - $19 (total cost of everyone else's contribution) = $7 Therefore, Sonja will spend $7 more than the rest of the office put together. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: John buys 500 newspapers.  Each newspaper sells for $2.  He sells 80% of them.  He buys them all for 75% less than the price at which he sells them.  How much profit does he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much John buys the newspapers for. He buys them for 75% less than the price at which he sells them, which means he buys them for 25% of the selling price. 25% of the selling price = 0.25 x 2 = $0.50 So, John buys each newspaper for $0.50. Next, let's calculate how much John earns from selling the newspapers. He sells 80% of the 500 newspapers, which is: 0.8 x 500 = 400 newspapers He sells each newspaper for $2, so his total earnings are: 400 x 2 = $800 Now, let's calculate how much John spent on buying the newspapers: 500 x 0.50 = $250 Therefore, John's profit is: $800 - $250 = $550 So, John makes a profit of $550. The answer is 550.\n\n\nQ: Maria wants to paint a picture and needs some tools to do that. She wants to buy a set of brushes for $20 and some canvas for three times more than the brushes. The paint costs Maria $8 per liter, and she needs at least 5 liters. How much money will she earn on the painting if she will be able to sell it for $200?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much Maria will spend on canvas. We know that the canvas will cost three times more than the brushes, which are $20. So, 3 x $20 = $60 for the canvas. Next, let's calculate how much Maria will spend on paint. She needs at least 5 liters, and each liter costs $8. So, 5 x $8 = $40 for the paint. Now, let's add up all of Maria's expenses: $20 for brushes + $60 for canvas + $40 for paint = $120 total expenses. If Maria sells the painting for $200, she will earn $200 - $120 = $80 profit. The answer is 80.\n\n\nQ: A gallon of whole milk that normally costs $3 is now sold at $2. A box of cereal was sold at a discount of $1. How much will you save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the discount for each gallon of whole milk. The discount is $3 - $2 = $1 per gallon. So, if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk, you will save 3 x $1 = $3. Next, let's calculate the discount for each box of cereal. The discount is $1 per box. So, if you buy 5 boxes of cereal, you will save 5 x $1 = $5. Therefore, the total amount you will save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal is $3 + $5 = $8. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: John has to replace the ball bearings for machines he works with.  He has 10 machines and they take 30 ball bearings each.  It normally costs $1 per ball bearing but right now there is a sale where they are only $.75.  Also since he is buying in bulk he gets a further 20% discount.  How much money did he save by buying them all during the sale rather than 1 at a time?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many ball bearings John needs in total. 10 machines x 30 ball bearings each = 300 ball bearings Next, we need to find out how much it would cost to buy all the ball bearings at the regular price: 300 ball bearings x $1 per ball bearing = $300 But since there is a sale where the ball bearings are only $.75 each, we can calculate the new cost: 300 ball bearings x $.75 per ball bearing = $225 Finally, we need to factor in the additional 20% discount for buying in bulk: $225 x 0.20 = $45 discount So the final cost for all the ball bearings is: $225 - $45 = $180 Therefore, John saved $300 - $180 = $120 by buying all the ball bearings during the sale rather than one at a time. The answer is 120.\n\n\n"
