  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Aimee does a poll around her neighborhood and makes sure to get answers from 50% men and 50% women. She finds that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. How many people did she poll?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Aimee polled an equal number of men and women. Therefore, we can assume that 50% of the total number of people she polled are women. Let's call the total number of people she polled \"x\". Then, the number of women she polled is 0.5x. Next, we know that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. Therefore, the number of women in favor of this idea is 0.35(0.5x) = 0.175x. We also know that 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. Therefore, the number of women who did not support shortening the school day is 39. We can set up an equation to solve for x: 0.175x + 39 = 0.5x Simplifying this equation, we get: 39 = 0.325x x = 120 Therefore, Aimee polled 120 people in total. The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: In a school, the number of participants in the 2018 Science Quiz Bowl was 150. There were 20 more than twice the number of participants in 2019 as there were in 2018. In 2020, the number of participants was 40 less than half the number of participants in 2019. How many more participants were there in 2019 than in 2020?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many participants there were in 2019. We know that there were 20 more than twice the number of participants in 2018, so we can set up an equation: 2019 participants = 20 + 2 * 2018 participants 2019 participants = 20 + 2 * 150 2019 participants = 320 Next, we need to find out how many participants there were in 2020. We know that the number of participants in 2020 was 40 less than half the number of participants in 2019, so we can set up another equation: 2020 participants = 0.5 * 2019 participants - 40 2020 participants = 0.5 * 320 - 40 2020 participants = 80 Finally, we can find out how many more participants there were in 2019 than in 2020: 2019 participants - 2020 participants = 320 - 80 = 240 Therefore, there were 240 more participants in 2019 than in 2020. The answer is 2020.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many students are in Alice's class. We know that there are 40 students and 10 instructors, so the total number of people in the class is 40 + 10 = 50. Next, we need to figure out how many students are bringing their own life vests. We know that 20% of the students are bringing life vests, so we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of students by 0.2: 40 x 0.2 = 8. So 8 students are bringing their own life vests. Now we need to figure out how many life vests we still need. We have 20 life vests on hand, and we need one for each of the 50 people in the class. So we need 50 - 20 = 30 more life vests. However, we already know that 8 students are bringing their own life vests, so we can subtract those from the total number we need: 30 - 8 = 22. Therefore, Alice needs to get 22 more life vests so that the entire class has one. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Ryan works in an office that has an even number of men and women working there.  Ryan participates in a meeting composed of 4 men and 6 women who are pulled from the office floor.   This reduces the number of women working on the office floor by 20%.  How many people work at Ryan's office?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the number of men and women in the office is even. Let's call this number \"x\". Next, we know that 4 men and 6 women were pulled from the office floor for the meeting. This means that there are now x-4 men and x-6 women still working on the office floor. We also know that the number of women on the office floor decreased by 20%. This means that the new number of women on the office floor is 0.8(x-6). Since we know that the number of men and women in the office is even, we can set up an equation: x-4 + 0.8(x-6) = x Simplifying this equation: 0.8x - 1.2 = 0 0.8x = 1.2 x = 1.2/0.8 x = 1.5 Since we know that x is an even number, the closest even number to 1.5 is 2. Therefore, there are 2 men and 2 women working at Ryan's office. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: Dani brings two and half dozen cupcakes for her 2nd-grade class.  There are 27 students (including Dani), 1 teacher, and 1 teacher\u2019s aid.  If 3 students called in sick that day, how many cupcakes are left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Dani brought in total. Two and a half dozen cupcakes is equal to 30 cupcakes (since a dozen is 12). Next, we need to figure out how many people will be receiving cupcakes. There are 27 students, 1 teacher, and 1 teacher's aid, for a total of 29 people. However, 3 students called in sick, so we need to subtract them from the total. 29 - 3 = 26 people receiving cupcakes. Now, we need to subtract 26 cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes Dani brought. 30 - 26 = 4 cupcakes left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: A soccer team had 24 players prepared for a soccer game. The first half saw 11 players start the game with 2 substitutions made. In the second half, the team made twice as many substitutions as it made in the first half. How many players on the team did not play that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many players played in the first half. We know that 11 players started the game, and 2 substitutions were made, so a total of 13 players played in the first half. Next, we need to find out how many substitutions were made in the second half. We know that the team made twice as many substitutions as it made in the first half, so that means 2 x 2 = 4 substitutions were made in the second half. Now we can calculate how many players played in the second half. We know that there were 13 players who played in the first half, and 4 substitutions were made, so a total of 17 players played in the second half. Finally, we can calculate how many players did not play that day. We know that the team had 24 players prepared for the game, and 13 players played in the first half, and 17 players played in the second half. So, 24 - 13 - 17 = 4 players did not play that day. Therefore, there were 4 players on the team who did not play that day. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Jessica just got her driving permit. She must complete 50 hours of driving with a parent to get her driver\u2019s license. It takes 20 minutes to drive to school. If she drives to and from school every day, how many school days will it take Jessica to meet the 50-hour driving requirement?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much time Jessica spends driving to and from school each day. She drives to school and back, so that's a total of 2 trips. Each trip takes 20 minutes, so she spends 40 minutes driving to and from school each day. Next, we need to figure out how many minutes of driving Jessica needs to complete in order to reach the 50-hour requirement. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 50 hours is equal to 50 x 60 = 3000 minutes. Now we can divide the total minutes of driving required by the number of minutes Jessica spends driving each day: 3000 / 40 = 75. So Jessica needs to drive for 75 school days in order to complete the 50-hour driving requirement. The answer is 50.\n\n\n"
