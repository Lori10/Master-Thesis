  "test_question": "Q: Terri is knitting a sweater with two sleeves, a collar, and a decorative rosette. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete, the collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches, and the rosette takes twice as many as the collar. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. How many stitches does each sleeve take?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Betsy is sewing a quilt.  The quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side.  Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together.  How many more squares does she need to sew together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many squares Betsy has already sewn together. If the quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side, then the total number of squares in the quilt is: 16 x 16 = 256 squares If Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together, then she has sewn: 0.25 x 256 = 64 squares Now we need to find out how many more squares she needs to sew together. To do this, we can subtract the number of squares she has already sewn from the total number of squares in the quilt: 256 - 64 = 192 squares So Betsy still needs to sew together 192 squares to complete the quilt. The answer is 192.\n\n\nQ: Norma takes her clothes to the laundry. She leaves 9 T-shirts and twice as many sweaters as T-shirts in the washer. When she returns she finds 3 sweaters and triple the number of T-shirts. How many items are missing?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Norma left 9 T-shirts in the washer. Next, we know that she left twice as many sweaters as T-shirts in the washer. So, she left 2 x 9 = 18 sweaters in the washer. When she returns, she finds 3 sweaters and triple the number of T-shirts. So, she finds 3 sweaters + 3 x 9 = 30 T-shirts. To find out how many items are missing, we need to add up the total number of items that Norma left in the washer and subtract the total number of items that she found when she returned. Total items left in washer: 9 T-shirts + 18 sweaters = 27 items Total items found when she returned: 3 sweaters + 30 T-shirts = 33 items So, the number of items missing is: 33 - 27 = 6 items. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Bertha started with two balls and gave one to her partner, so she has one ball left. Next, we need to figure out how many balls she loses and how many wear out. In 20 games, she loses 20/5 = 4 balls and 20/10 = 2 balls wear out. Finally, we need to figure out how many balls she buys. In 20 games, she buys 20/4 = 5 canisters of three balls, which is a total of 5*3 = 15 balls. So, in total, Bertha has 1 (starting ball) - 4 (lost balls) - 2 (worn out balls) + 15 (bought balls) = 10 tennis balls. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Becky has 50 necklaces in her jewelry collection. 3 of the necklaces have broken beads so she collects the unbroken beads for crafting and throws the other parts of the 3 the necklaces out. Becky buys 5 new necklaces that week. She decides to give 15 of her old necklaces to her friends as gifts. How many necklaces does she own now?\nA: Let's think step by step. Becky starts with 50 necklaces. She throws out 3 necklaces, so she now has 50 - 3 = 47 necklaces. She buys 5 new necklaces, so she now has 47 + 5 = 52 necklaces. She gives away 15 necklaces, so she now has 52 - 15 = 37 necklaces. Therefore, Becky now owns 37 necklaces. The answer is 37.\n\n\nQ: A 1165 cm long rope is cut into 154 pieces. 150 of the pieces are equally sized and the remaining pieces are 100mm each. Find the length of each of the equal pieces in millimeters.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total length of the 100mm pieces. There are 154 pieces in total, and 150 of them are equal in size. So, the remaining 4 pieces must be the 100mm pieces. 4 pieces x 100mm/piece = 400mm Now, we can subtract the length of the 100mm pieces from the total length of the rope: 1165cm - 40cm = 1125cm We know that the 150 equal pieces are the same size, so we can divide the remaining length by 150 to find the length of each piece: 1125cm \u00f7 150 pieces = 7.5cm/piece Finally, we need to convert centimeters to millimeters: 7.5cm/piece x 10mm/cm = 75mm/piece Therefore, each of the equal pieces is 75 millimeters long. The answer is 75.\n\n\nQ: Stella and Twinkle are filling up a truck with a capacity of 6000 stone blocks at the rate of 250 blocks per hour per person. They work for four hours and are then joined by 6 other people who also work at the same rate. How many hours did filling the truck take?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many blocks Stella and Twinkle can fill in 4 hours. 250 blocks per hour per person x 2 people x 4 hours = 2000 blocks So, after 4 hours, Stella and Twinkle have filled 2000 blocks. Next, we need to find out how many blocks all 8 people can fill in one hour. 250 blocks per hour per person x 8 people = 2000 blocks So, all 8 people can fill 2000 blocks in one hour. Now, we need to find out how many more blocks they need to fill to reach the capacity of 6000 blocks. 6000 blocks - 2000 blocks = 4000 blocks Finally, we can use the rate of 2000 blocks per hour for all 8 people to find out how many hours it will take to fill the remaining 4000 blocks. 4000 blocks \u00f7 2000 blocks per hour = 2 hours Therefore, filling the truck took a total of 4 + 2 = 6 hours. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Janice can type 6 sentences per minute. Today at work, Janice continued working on a paper she started typing yesterday. She typed for 20 minutes, took a break, and typed 15 minutes longer. She then had to erase 40 sentences she had typed incorrectly. After a meeting, she typed for 18 minutes more. In all, the paper had 536 sentences by the end of today. How many sentences did she start with today?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many sentences Janice typed in the first 20 minutes: 6 sentences/minute x 20 minutes = 120 sentences Next, let's find out how many sentences Janice typed in the additional 15 minutes: 6 sentences/minute x 15 minutes = 90 sentences Now, let's subtract the 40 sentences she had to erase: 120 sentences + 90 sentences - 40 sentences = 170 sentences So, Janice typed 170 sentences before the meeting. We know that the paper had 536 sentences by the end of the day, so we can subtract the 170 sentences Janice typed before the meeting to find out how many sentences she started with: 536 sentences - 170 sentences = 366 sentences Therefore, Janice started with 366 sentences today. The answer is 366.\n\n\n"
