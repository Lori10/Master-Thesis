  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Grant spends $200.00 a year to have the newspaper delivered daily to his house.  Juanita buys the newspaper daily.  Monday through Saturday, she spends $0.50 and on Sunday she spends $2.00.  How much more money does Juanita spend buying the newspaper yearly than Grant?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper daily from Monday to Saturday: $0.50 x 6 = $3.00 Now, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper on Sundays: $2.00 x 1 = $2.00 Next, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper weekly: $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00 Finally, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper yearly: $5.00 x 52 = $260.00 Now, let's calculate the difference between what Juanita spends and what Grant spends: $260.00 - $200.00 = $60.00 Therefore, Juanita spends $60.00 more buying the newspaper yearly than Grant. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how much money Carl will earn in four weeks. If he earns $0.50 every time, and he buys a candy bar each time, that means he's spending $0.50 each week. But he's also earning $0.75 each week for taking out his neighbor's trash. So his net earnings each week are $0.75 - $0.50 = $0.25. Over four weeks, that's a total of $0.25 x 4 = $1. So Carl will have $1 to spend on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.50, he can buy 2 candy bars with his earnings. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Janice can type 6 sentences per minute. Today at work, Janice continued working on a paper she started typing yesterday. She typed for 20 minutes, took a break, and typed 15 minutes longer. She then had to erase 40 sentences she had typed incorrectly. After a meeting, she typed for 18 minutes more. In all, the paper had 536 sentences by the end of today. How many sentences did she start with today?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many sentences Janice typed in the first 20 minutes: 6 sentences/minute x 20 minutes = 120 sentences Next, let's find out how many sentences Janice typed in the additional 15 minutes: 6 sentences/minute x 15 minutes = 90 sentences Now, let's subtract the 40 sentences she had to erase: 120 sentences + 90 sentences - 40 sentences = 170 sentences So, Janice typed 170 sentences before the meeting. We know that the paper had 536 sentences by the end of the day, so we can subtract the 170 sentences Janice typed before the meeting to find out how many sentences she started with: 536 sentences - 170 sentences = 366 sentences Therefore, Janice started with 366 sentences today. The answer is 366.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: Betty and Dora started making some cupcakes at the same time. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour and Dora makes 8 every hour. If Betty took a two-hour break, what is the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Betty made in the first 3 hours before taking a break. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour, so in 3 hours, she would make: 10 cupcakes/hour x 3 hours = 30 cupcakes Next, we need to find out how many cupcakes Dora made in the same 5 hours. Dora makes 8 cupcakes every hour, so in 5 hours, she would make: 8 cupcakes/hour x 5 hours = 40 cupcakes Now we need to find the difference between the number of cupcakes they made. Betty made 30 cupcakes before taking a break, and Dora made 40 cupcakes in the same 5 hours. So the difference between the number of cupcakes they made is: 40 cupcakes - 30 cupcakes = 10 cupcakes Therefore, the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours is 10 cupcakes. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Each week Jaime saves $50. Every two weeks she spends $46 of her savings on a nice lunch with her mum. How long will it take her to save $135?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much money Jaime saves in a week after spending $46 every two weeks on lunch with her mom. In two weeks, Jaime spends $46 on lunch, so in one week, she spends $23 on lunch. Therefore, Jaime saves $50 - $23 = $27 per week. Next, we need to figure out how many weeks it will take Jaime to save $135. We can set up an equation: $27 per week x number of weeks = $135 To solve for the number of weeks, we can divide both sides by $27: number of weeks = $135 / $27 number of weeks = 5 Therefore, it will take Jaime 5 weeks to save $135. The answer is 135.\n\n\nQ: Peter and Kristin are to read 20 fantasy novels each in a week. Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin. If Peter reads one book in 18 hours, how long will Kristin read half of her books?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Peter to read one book. We know that he can read one book in 18 hours, so we can write: Peter's reading speed = 1 book / 18 hours Next, we need to find out how long it takes Kristin to read one book. We know that Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin, so we can write: Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * Peter's reading speed Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * (1 book / 18 hours) Kristin's reading speed = 1 book / 54 hours Now we can use Kristin's reading speed to find out how long it takes her to read half of her books. We know that she needs to read 20 books in a week, so she needs to read 10 books in half a week (3.5 days). We can write: Time to read 10 books = 10 books * (1 book / 54 hours) * (24 hours / 1 day) * (3.5 days) Time to read 10 books = 14 hours and 27 minutes Therefore, it will take Kristin 14 hours and 27 minutes to read half of her books. The answer is 27.\n\n\nQ: Jessica just got her driving permit. She must complete 50 hours of driving with a parent to get her driver\u2019s license. It takes 20 minutes to drive to school. If she drives to and from school every day, how many school days will it take Jessica to meet the 50-hour driving requirement?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much time Jessica spends driving to and from school each day. She drives to school and back, so that's a total of 2 trips. Each trip takes 20 minutes, so she spends 40 minutes driving to and from school each day. Next, we need to figure out how many minutes of driving Jessica needs to complete in order to reach the 50-hour requirement. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 50 hours is equal to 50 x 60 = 3000 minutes. Now we can divide the total minutes of driving required by the number of minutes Jessica spends driving each day: 3000 / 40 = 75. So Jessica needs to drive for 75 school days in order to complete the 50-hour driving requirement. The answer is 50.\n\n\n"
