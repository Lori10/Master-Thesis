  "formatted_prompt": "Q: James buys $3000 worth of stuff from Amazon.  He has to return a TV that cost $700 and a bike that cost $500.  He also sells another bike that cost 20% more than the bike he returned for 80% of what he bought it for.  He then buys a toaster for $100.  How much is he out of pocket for everything?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, James spent $3000 on Amazon. Then he returned a TV that cost $700 and a bike that cost $500. So, he spent $3000 - $700 - $500 = $1800. Next, he sold a bike that cost 20% more than the bike he returned. If the returned bike cost $500, then the bike he sold cost 1.2 * $500 = $600. He sold it for 80% of what he bought it for, which is 0.8 * $600 = $480. Now, let's add up all the transactions. James spent $1800 on Amazon, sold a bike for $480, and bought a toaster for $100. So, he is out of pocket for $1800 - $480 + $100 = $1420. Therefore, James is out of pocket for $1420. The answer is 1420.\n\n\nQ: John buys 500 newspapers.  Each newspaper sells for $2.  He sells 80% of them.  He buys them all for 75% less than the price at which he sells them.  How much profit does he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much John buys the newspapers for. He buys them for 75% less than the price at which he sells them, which means he buys them for 25% of the selling price. 25% of the selling price = 0.25 x 2 = $0.50 So, John buys each newspaper for $0.50. Next, let's calculate how much John earns from selling the newspapers. He sells 80% of the 500 newspapers, which is: 0.8 x 500 = 400 newspapers He sells each newspaper for $2, so his total earnings are: 400 x 2 = $800 Now, let's calculate how much John spent on buying the newspapers: 500 x 0.50 = $250 Therefore, John's profit is: $800 - $250 = $550 So, John makes a profit of $550. The answer is 550.\n\n\nQ: Jim buys a wedding ring for $10,000.  He gets his wife a ring that is twice that much and sells the first one for half its value.  How much is he out of pocket?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Jim buys a wedding ring for $10,000. Next, we know that he gets his wife a ring that is twice that much, which means he spends $20,000 on her ring. Now, he sells the first ring for half its value, which means he sells it for $5,000. To find out how much Jim is out of pocket, we need to add up all of his expenses and subtract any income he received from selling the first ring. So, Jim's total expenses are $10,000 + $20,000 = $30,000. His income from selling the first ring is $5,000. Therefore, Jim is out of pocket $30,000 - $5,000 = $25,000. The answer is 25000.\n\n\nQ: Michael has $42. Michael gives away half the money to his brother. His brother then buys 3 dollars worth of candy. If his brother has $35 left, how much money, in dollars, did his brother have at first?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Michael had $42. Next, he gave away half of that money to his brother, which is $21. His brother then spent $3 on candy, leaving him with $35. To figure out how much money his brother had at first, we need to work backwards. If his brother had $35 after spending $3 on candy, then he had $38 before buying the candy. And if his brother received $21 from Michael, then he must have had $17 to begin with. Therefore, his brother had $17 at first. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how much money Carl will earn in four weeks. If he earns $0.50 every time, and he buys a candy bar each time, that means he's spending $0.50 each week. But he's also earning $0.75 each week for taking out his neighbor's trash. So his net earnings each week are $0.75 - $0.50 = $0.25. Over four weeks, that's a total of $0.25 x 4 = $1. So Carl will have $1 to spend on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.50, he can buy 2 candy bars with his earnings. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Lorie has 2 pieces of $100 bills. He requested to change one piece of the $100 bills into $50 bills. Half of the remaining $100 bill is changed to $10 bills while the rest is changed to $5 bills. How many pieces of bills will she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Lorie has 2 pieces of $100 bills, which means she has a total of $200. Next, she changes one piece of the $100 bill into $50 bills. One piece of $100 bill is equal to 2 pieces of $50 bills, so she now has a total of $200 - $100 + $100 = $200. Half of the remaining $100 bill is changed to $10 bills. Half of $100 is $50, so she changes $50 into $10 bills. $50 divided by $10 is 5, so she now has 5 pieces of $10 bills. The rest of the remaining $100 bill is changed to $5 bills. The remaining amount is $50, and $50 divided by $5 is 10, so she now has 10 pieces of $5 bills. Therefore, Lorie now has a total of 2 pieces of $50 bills, 5 pieces of $10 bills, and 10 pieces of $5 bills, which is a total of 17 pieces of bills. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Tracy has been collecting novels from her friends to donate to the Children For The Future charity organization. In the first week she collects a certain number of books. In the next five weeks, she collects ten times as many books as she did in the first week. How many books did she collect in the first week if she has 99 books now?\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that Tracy collected x number of books in the first week. According to the problem, in the next five weeks, she collected ten times as many books as she did in the first week. So, in the next five weeks, she collected 10x books. Therefore, the total number of books she collected is x + 10x = 11x. We also know that she has 99 books now. So, we can set up an equation: 11x = 99 To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 11: x = 9 Therefore, Tracy collected 9 books in the first week. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Maria wants to paint a picture and needs some tools to do that. She wants to buy a set of brushes for $20 and some canvas for three times more than the brushes. The paint costs Maria $8 per liter, and she needs at least 5 liters. How much money will she earn on the painting if she will be able to sell it for $200?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much Maria will spend on canvas. We know that the canvas will cost three times more than the brushes, which are $20. So, 3 x $20 = $60 for the canvas. Next, let's calculate how much Maria will spend on paint. She needs at least 5 liters, and each liter costs $8. So, 5 x $8 = $40 for the paint. Now, let's add up all of Maria's expenses: $20 for brushes + $60 for canvas + $40 for paint = $120 total expenses. If Maria sells the painting for $200, she will earn $200 - $120 = $80 profit. The answer is 80.\n\n\n"
