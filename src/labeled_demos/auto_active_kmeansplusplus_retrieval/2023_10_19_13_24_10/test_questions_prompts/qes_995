  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Jerry is sweeping up pieces of broken glass in the parking lot. He sweeps up 20 amber pieces, 35 green pieces, and some clear pieces. If the green pieces are 25% of the total glass he sweeps up, how many pieces were clear?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the green pieces are 25% of the total glass, so we can set up an equation: 35 = 0.25x where x is the total number of pieces of glass Jerry sweeps up. We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.25: x = 140 So Jerry sweeps up a total of 140 pieces of glass. We also know that he sweeps up 20 amber pieces and 35 green pieces, so the number of clear pieces must be: 140 - 20 - 35 = 85 Therefore, Jerry swept up 85 clear pieces of glass. The answer is 85.\n\n\nQ: Andy is mixing blue, green and white paint in a 1 : 2 : 5 ratio. If he uses 6 gallons of green paint, how many gallons of paint does he use total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much paint Andy is using in total based on the ratio given. The ratio of blue : green : white paint is 1 : 2 : 5. This means that for every 1 gallon of blue paint, Andy uses 2 gallons of green paint and 5 gallons of white paint. Since we know that Andy is using 6 gallons of green paint, we can use this information to find out how much of the other colors he is using. 2 gallons of green paint is equivalent to 1 gallon of blue paint, so Andy is using 3 gallons of blue paint (since 6/2 = 3). 5 gallons of white paint is equivalent to 2.5 gallons of green paint, so Andy is using 30 gallons of white paint (since 6 x 5 = 30). Therefore, Andy is using a total of 6 + 3 + 30 = 39 gallons of paint. The answer is 39.\n\n\nQ: Betsy is sewing a quilt.  The quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side.  Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together.  How many more squares does she need to sew together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many squares Betsy has already sewn together. If the quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side, then the total number of squares in the quilt is: 16 x 16 = 256 squares If Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together, then she has sewn: 0.25 x 256 = 64 squares Now we need to find out how many more squares she needs to sew together. To do this, we can subtract the number of squares she has already sewn from the total number of squares in the quilt: 256 - 64 = 192 squares So Betsy still needs to sew together 192 squares to complete the quilt. The answer is 192.\n\n\nQ: Becky has 50 necklaces in her jewelry collection. 3 of the necklaces have broken beads so she collects the unbroken beads for crafting and throws the other parts of the 3 the necklaces out. Becky buys 5 new necklaces that week. She decides to give 15 of her old necklaces to her friends as gifts. How many necklaces does she own now?\nA: Let's think step by step. Becky starts with 50 necklaces. She throws out 3 necklaces, so she now has 50 - 3 = 47 necklaces. She buys 5 new necklaces, so she now has 47 + 5 = 52 necklaces. She gives away 15 necklaces, so she now has 52 - 15 = 37 necklaces. Therefore, Becky now owns 37 necklaces. The answer is 37.\n\n\nQ: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Bertha started with two balls and gave one to her partner, so she has one ball left. Next, we need to figure out how many balls she loses and how many wear out. In 20 games, she loses 20/5 = 4 balls and 20/10 = 2 balls wear out. Finally, we need to figure out how many balls she buys. In 20 games, she buys 20/4 = 5 canisters of three balls, which is a total of 5*3 = 15 balls. So, in total, Bertha has 1 (starting ball) - 4 (lost balls) - 2 (worn out balls) + 15 (bought balls) = 10 tennis balls. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Nori had 4 boxes of crayons with 8 crayons in each box. She gave 5 crayons to Mae and also give some crayons to Lea. How many more crayons did she give to Lea than Mae if she has only 15 crayons left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many crayons Nori had in total. 4 boxes x 8 crayons per box = 32 crayons Next, we need to subtract the 5 crayons Nori gave to Mae. 32 crayons - 5 crayons = 27 crayons We know that Nori has 15 crayons left, so we can subtract that from the 27 crayons to find out how many crayons she gave to Lea. 27 crayons - 15 crayons = 12 crayons Therefore, Nori gave 12 crayons to Lea. To find out how many more crayons Nori gave to Lea than Mae, we can subtract the 5 crayons from Mae from the 12 crayons given to Lea. 12 crayons - 5 crayons = 7 crayons So Nori gave 7 more crayons to Lea than Mae. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Cleo and Ignacio placed 30 of their marbles in a jar on a Monday. They took 3/5 of the marbles from the jar the next day and divided them equally. On the third day, Cleo took 1/2 of the marbles remaining in the jars. How many marbles did Cleo have on the third day?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many marbles were taken from the jar on the second day. 3/5 of 30 marbles = (3/5) x 30 = 18 marbles So, 18 marbles were taken from the jar on the second day. Step 2: Find out how many marbles were left in the jar after the second day. 30 - 18 = 12 marbles So, 12 marbles were left in the jar after the second day. Step 3: Find out how many marbles Cleo took on the third day. 1/2 of 12 marbles = (1/2) x 12 = 6 marbles So, Cleo took 6 marbles on the third day. Step 4: Find out how many marbles Cleo had on the third day. Cleo had 6 marbles on the third day. Therefore, Cleo had 6 marbles on the third day. The answer is 6.\n\n\n"
