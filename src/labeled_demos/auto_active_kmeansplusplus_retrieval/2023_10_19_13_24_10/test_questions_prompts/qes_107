A group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat. How many kilograms of meat were on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A group of 30 tourists sets out on a walking tour of the rainforest. Two tourists are eaten by anacondas, then half the remaining tourists try to pet poisonous dart frogs and get poisoned. If only 1/7 of the poisoned tourists recovered, how many tourists are left at the end of the tour?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Start with 30 tourists. Step 2: Two tourists are eaten by anacondas, so we subtract 2 from 30 to get 28 tourists remaining. Step 3: Half of the remaining tourists try to pet poisonous dart frogs and get poisoned. Half of 28 is 14, so we subtract 14 from 28 to get 14 tourists remaining. Step 4: Only 1/7 of the poisoned tourists recovered. 1/7 of 14 is 2, so we add 2 to the 14 tourists remaining to get 16 tourists at the end of the tour. Therefore, there are 16 tourists left at the end of the tour. The answer is 16.\n\n\nQ: Gilbert, the bearded dragon, eats 4 crickets per week when the temperature averages 90 degrees F per day, but he eats twice as many crickets per week when the temperature averages 100 degrees F.  How many crickets will he eat over 15 weeks if the temperature averages 90 degrees F for 80% of the time, and 100 degrees F for the remainder of the time?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many weeks Gilbert will be eating 4 crickets per week. Since the temperature averages 90 degrees F for 80% of the time, that means he will be eating 4 crickets per week for 80% of 15 weeks, which is 12 weeks. Next, we need to find out how many weeks Gilbert will be eating twice as many crickets per week. Since the temperature averages 100 degrees F for the remaining 20% of the time, that means he will be eating twice as many crickets per week for 20% of 15 weeks, which is 3 weeks. Now we can calculate how many crickets Gilbert will eat in total. For the 12 weeks he eats 4 crickets per week, he will eat a total of 4 x 12 = 48 crickets. For the 3 weeks he eats twice as many crickets per week, he will eat a total of 2 x 4 = 8 crickets per week, or 8 x 3 = 24 crickets in total. Adding these two totals together, Gilbert will eat a total of 48 + 24 = 72 crickets over 15 weeks. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Phoebe has two pizzas to share with her and three friends. One has pepperoni and the other has cheese. They both have 16 slices. They all eat the same amount. One friend eats only pepperoni, while the rest have an equal number of slices of each. At the end, there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese, how many slices does each person eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 2 pizzas with 16 slices each, so there are a total of 32 slices. Next, we know that one friend only eats pepperoni, so they eat one slice from the pepperoni pizza. That leaves 31 slices, with 15 slices from each pizza. We also know that there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese left. So, the remaining 15 slices are divided equally among the remaining 3 friends, which means each of them eats 5 slices. Therefore, each person eats 1 slice of pepperoni and 5 slices of cheese. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Alex was having a cookout Friday night and planned to serve burgers to his guests.  He planned to cook 3 burgers for each guest and had invited 10 friends over.  1 of his friends didn't eat meat and said they would bring their own food.  Another one of his friends didn't eat bread and would not need the buns.  The burger buns came 8 to a pack.  How many packs of buns did Alex need to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many guests will be eating burgers. Alex invited 10 friends, but one won't be eating meat, so there will be 9 guests eating burgers. Next, we need to figure out how many burgers Alex will need to cook. He plans to cook 3 burgers for each guest, so he will need to cook 3 x 9 = 27 burgers. Now we need to figure out how many buns Alex will need. Each burger needs 2 buns, but one of his friends won't be eating the buns, so he will only need 2 x 26 = 52 buns. Since the buns come 8 to a pack, we need to divide 52 by 8 to find out how many packs of buns Alex needs to buy. 52 \u00f7 8 = 6.5 Since we can't buy half a pack of buns, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So Alex needs to buy 7 packs of buns. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Van Helsing gets paid by the town to remove all the vampires and werewolves. He gets $5 per vampire and $10 per werewolf. He removes half the vampires and removes 8 werewolves, and earned $105. There were 4 times as many werewolves as vampires. What percentage of the werewolves did he remove?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assign variables to the unknowns in the problem. Let's call the number of vampires \"V\" and the number of werewolves \"W\". We know that Van Helsing gets paid $5 per vampire and removes half of them, so he earns 5*(1/2)V = 2.5V dollars from the vampires. We also know that he gets paid $10 per werewolf and removes 8 of them, so he earns 10*(W-8) dollars from the werewolves. Finally, we know that there were 4 times as many werewolves as vampires, so W = 4V. Putting all of this together, we can create an equation to solve for V: 2.5V + 10(4V-8) = 105 Simplifying this equation, we get: 42.5V = 185 V = 4.35 Since we can't have a fraction of a vampire, we'll round up to 5 vampires. Using the equation W = 4V, we can find that there were 20 werewolves. Van Helsing removed 8 werewolves, so he removed 8/20 = 0.4 or 40% of the werewolves. The answer is 40.\n\n\nQ: Xena is trying to outrun a dragon to get to the safety of a cave it's too big to fit into. Xena has a 600 foot head start, but the dragon can burn her if it gets within 120 feet of her. If Xena runs 15 feet per second and the dragon flies 30 feet per second, how many seconds does Xena have to get to the cave?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how fast the dragon can catch up to Xena. The dragon can cover 30 - 15 = 15 feet per second faster than Xena. Next, we need to find out how far the dragon needs to travel to catch up to Xena. This distance is 600 - 120 = 480 feet. Finally, we can use the formula distance = rate x time to find out how long Xena has to get to the cave. We can set up the equation as follows: 480 = 15t + 30t Simplifying the equation, we get: 480 = 45t Dividing both sides by 45, we get: t = 10.67 seconds Therefore, Xena has 10.67 seconds to get to the cave before the dragon catches up to her. The answer is 11.\n\n\nQ: A local restaurant is offering an 8 piece fried chicken bucket and 2 sides for $12.00 that will feed 6 people.  If Monty was having a family reunion for 36 family members, how much will it cost him to buy enough chicken and sides to feed everyone one serving?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many servings of chicken and sides Monty needs to feed 36 people. Since the restaurant's 8 piece fried chicken bucket feeds 6 people, we can calculate that Monty needs 6 buckets of chicken to feed 36 people. Next, we need to figure out how many sides Monty needs. The restaurant offers 2 sides with each 8 piece chicken bucket, so Monty needs 6 x 2 = 12 sides. Now, we can calculate the total cost. Monty is paying $12.00 for 6 people, so he needs to pay 6/6 = 1 dollar per person. To feed 36 people, Monty needs to pay 36 x 1 = $36.00 for the chicken and sides. The answer is 36.\n\n\nQ: At the zoo, there are 5 different types of animals. Seeing each animal type takes around 6 minutes. How much time would it take to see each animal type if the zoo decided to import 4 new species?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many animal types there will be in total after the zoo imports 4 new species. 5 (original animal types) + 4 (new species) = 9 (total animal types) Next, we need to find out how long it takes to see each animal type. 6 minutes per animal type x 9 animal types = 54 minutes Therefore, it would take 54 minutes to see each animal type if the zoo decided to import 4 new species. The answer is 4.\n\n\n"
