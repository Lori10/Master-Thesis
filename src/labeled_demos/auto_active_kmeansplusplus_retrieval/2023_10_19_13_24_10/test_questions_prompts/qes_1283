  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Mary wants 144 cupcakes for her party. Mary has already made 36 cherry cupcakes, and 48 berry cupcakes. Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes for the rest. How much of each should she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Mary has already made: 36 cherry + 48 berry = 84 cupcakes Next, we need to figure out how many more cupcakes Mary needs to make: 144 total cupcakes - 84 cupcakes already made = 60 cupcakes Since Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, we can divide the remaining 60 cupcakes by 2: 60 cupcakes \u00f7 2 = 30 cupcakes of each flavor Therefore, Mary should make 30 chocolate cupcakes and 30 vanilla cupcakes to have a total of 144 cupcakes for her party. The answer is 144.\n\n\nQ: Miriam currently has 30 marbles, but she used to have more. Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, gave her sister twice that amount and gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has. How many marbles did Miriam start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, so she now has 30 - 60 = -30 marbles. This doesn't make sense, so we know that Miriam must have started with more than 60 marbles. Next, we know that Miriam gave her sister twice the amount she gave her brother, so her sister received 2 * 60 = 120 marbles. We also know that Miriam gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has, so Savanna received 3 * 30 = 90 marbles. In total, Miriam gave away 60 + 120 + 90 = 270 marbles. If Miriam started with x marbles, we can set up the equation: x - 270 = 30 Solving for x, we get: x = 300 Therefore, Miriam started with 300 marbles. The answer is 300.\n\n\nQ: Dani brings two and half dozen cupcakes for her 2nd-grade class.  There are 27 students (including Dani), 1 teacher, and 1 teacher\u2019s aid.  If 3 students called in sick that day, how many cupcakes are left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Dani brought in total. Two and a half dozen cupcakes is equal to 30 cupcakes (since a dozen is 12). Next, we need to figure out how many people will be receiving cupcakes. There are 27 students, 1 teacher, and 1 teacher's aid, for a total of 29 people. However, 3 students called in sick, so we need to subtract them from the total. 29 - 3 = 26 people receiving cupcakes. Now, we need to subtract 26 cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes Dani brought. 30 - 26 = 4 cupcakes left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Phoebe has two pizzas to share with her and three friends. One has pepperoni and the other has cheese. They both have 16 slices. They all eat the same amount. One friend eats only pepperoni, while the rest have an equal number of slices of each. At the end, there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese, how many slices does each person eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 2 pizzas with 16 slices each, so there are a total of 32 slices. Next, we know that one friend only eats pepperoni, so they eat one slice from the pepperoni pizza. That leaves 31 slices, with 15 slices from each pizza. We also know that there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese left. So, the remaining 15 slices are divided equally among the remaining 3 friends, which means each of them eats 5 slices. Therefore, each person eats 1 slice of pepperoni and 5 slices of cheese. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Seth bought some boxes of oranges. He gave a box to his mother. He then gave away half of the remaining boxes. If Seth has 4 boxes of oranges left, how many boxes did he buy in the first place?\nA: Let's think step by step. 1. Seth gave a box to his mother, so he had x-1 boxes left. 2. He then gave away half of the remaining boxes, which means he gave away (x-1)/2 boxes. 3. After giving away half of the remaining boxes, he had 4 boxes left. So, we can set up an equation: (x-1)/2 = x-4 4. Solving for x, we can simplify the equation: x-1 = 2(x-4) -> x-1 = 2x-8 -> x = 7 Therefore, Seth bought 7 boxes of oranges in the first place. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Bertha started with two balls and gave one to her partner, so she has one ball left. Next, we need to figure out how many balls she loses and how many wear out. In 20 games, she loses 20/5 = 4 balls and 20/10 = 2 balls wear out. Finally, we need to figure out how many balls she buys. In 20 games, she buys 20/4 = 5 canisters of three balls, which is a total of 5*3 = 15 balls. So, in total, Bertha has 1 (starting ball) - 4 (lost balls) - 2 (worn out balls) + 15 (bought balls) = 10 tennis balls. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Phill cuts the pizza in half, which gives him 2 slices. Then he cuts both halves in half, which gives him 4 slices. And then he cuts each slice in half again, which gives him 8 slices in total. Next, Phill passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends, which means he gives away 3 slices in total. He also passes out 2 slices to 2 of his friends, which means he gives away 4 slices in total. Therefore, Phill has given away a total of 7 slices of pizza. If he started with 8 slices, then he has 1 slice left for himself. The answer is 1.\n\n\n"
