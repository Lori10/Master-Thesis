  "test_question": "Q: John injured his back and needs to go to physical therapy.  He went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.  Each week he went twice for 2 hours at a time.  If the sessions cost $125 per hour how much did the physical therapy cost?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: John adopts a dog from a shelter.  The dog ends up having health problems and this requires 3 vet appointments,  which cost $400 each.  After the first appointment, John paid $100 for pet insurance that covers 80% of the subsequent visits.  How much did he pay in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, John paid $400 for the first vet appointment. Then, he paid $100 for pet insurance that covers 80% of the subsequent visits. This means that for the next two vet appointments, he will only have to pay 20% of the cost. So for the second and third vet appointments, John will pay: 20% of $400 = $80 Therefore, the total cost for the three vet appointments will be: $400 (first appointment) + $80 (second appointment) + $80 (third appointment) = $560 So John paid a total of $560 for the three vet appointments. The answer is 560.\n\n\nQ: Each week Jaime saves $50. Every two weeks she spends $46 of her savings on a nice lunch with her mum. How long will it take her to save $135?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much money Jaime saves in a week after spending $46 every two weeks on lunch with her mom. In two weeks, Jaime spends $46 on lunch, so in one week, she spends $23 on lunch. Therefore, Jaime saves $50 - $23 = $27 per week. Next, we need to figure out how many weeks it will take Jaime to save $135. We can set up an equation: $27 per week x number of weeks = $135 To solve for the number of weeks, we can divide both sides by $27: number of weeks = $135 / $27 number of weeks = 5 Therefore, it will take Jaime 5 weeks to save $135. The answer is 135.\n\n\nQ: Grant spends $200.00 a year to have the newspaper delivered daily to his house.  Juanita buys the newspaper daily.  Monday through Saturday, she spends $0.50 and on Sunday she spends $2.00.  How much more money does Juanita spend buying the newspaper yearly than Grant?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper daily from Monday to Saturday: $0.50 x 6 = $3.00 Now, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper on Sundays: $2.00 x 1 = $2.00 Next, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper weekly: $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00 Finally, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper yearly: $5.00 x 52 = $260.00 Now, let's calculate the difference between what Juanita spends and what Grant spends: $260.00 - $200.00 = $60.00 Therefore, Juanita spends $60.00 more buying the newspaper yearly than Grant. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: John takes a 10-minute shower every other day for 4 weeks. If his shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute.  How much water does he use in those 4 weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many showers John takes in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks is 4 x 7 = 28 days. Since John takes a shower every other day, he takes 28/2 = 14 showers in 4 weeks. Next, we need to find out how much water he uses per shower. John takes a 10-minute shower, and his shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute. So, he uses 10 x 2 = 20 gallons of water per shower. Finally, we can find out how much water he uses in 4 weeks by multiplying the amount of water per shower by the number of showers he takes: 20 gallons per shower x 14 showers = 280 gallons of water in 4 weeks. Therefore, John uses 280 gallons of water in those 4 weeks. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Jenny signs up for dinner theater with 5 of her friends. Each person pays $50 for the ticket and $10 for their entr\u00e9e, and half the people also buy unlimited drink tickets for $30/person. Then the dinner theater is canceled due to COVID, and each person gets a 90% refund. How much money did the group of six friends lose?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total cost per person. Each person pays $50 for the ticket and $10 for their entr\u00e9e, so the total cost per person is $50 + $10 = $60. Half of the people also buy unlimited drink tickets for $30/person, so three people buy drink tickets. The total cost per person for those who bought drink tickets is $60 + $30 = $90. Now we can calculate the total cost for the group of six friends. Since there are three people who bought drink tickets and three who didn't, we can calculate the total cost as follows: Total cost = (3 people x $90/person) + (3 people x $60/person) Total cost = $270 + $180 Total cost = $450 However, the dinner theater was canceled due to COVID, and each person gets a 90% refund. Therefore, the group of six friends will only get back 90% of the total cost, which is: Refund = 90% x $450 Refund = $405 Therefore, the group of six friends lost $450 - $405 = $45 in total. The answer is 45.\n\n\nQ: John has to replace the ball bearings for machines he works with.  He has 10 machines and they take 30 ball bearings each.  It normally costs $1 per ball bearing but right now there is a sale where they are only $.75.  Also since he is buying in bulk he gets a further 20% discount.  How much money did he save by buying them all during the sale rather than 1 at a time?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many ball bearings John needs in total. 10 machines x 30 ball bearings each = 300 ball bearings Next, we need to find out how much it would cost to buy all the ball bearings at the regular price: 300 ball bearings x $1 per ball bearing = $300 But since there is a sale where the ball bearings are only $.75 each, we can calculate the new cost: 300 ball bearings x $.75 per ball bearing = $225 Finally, we need to factor in the additional 20% discount for buying in bulk: $225 x 0.20 = $45 discount So the final cost for all the ball bearings is: $225 - $45 = $180 Therefore, John saved $300 - $180 = $120 by buying all the ball bearings during the sale rather than one at a time. The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: Jim buys a wedding ring for $10,000.  He gets his wife a ring that is twice that much and sells the first one for half its value.  How much is he out of pocket?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Jim buys a wedding ring for $10,000. Next, we know that he gets his wife a ring that is twice that much, which means he spends $20,000 on her ring. Now, he sells the first ring for half its value, which means he sells it for $5,000. To find out how much Jim is out of pocket, we need to add up all of his expenses and subtract any income he received from selling the first ring. So, Jim's total expenses are $10,000 + $20,000 = $30,000. His income from selling the first ring is $5,000. Therefore, Jim is out of pocket $30,000 - $5,000 = $25,000. The answer is 25000.\n\n\nQ: Carson runs a carpool for five of his friends. The five of them cover all the gas expenses to compensate Carson for his time. Their total commute is 21 miles one way, gas costs $2.50/gallon, Carson's car gets 30 miles/gallon, and they commute to work 5 days a week, 4 weeks a month. How much does each person pay toward gas monthly?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per day. Since they commute 21 miles one way, their round trip is 21 x 2 = 42 miles. Next, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per week. They commute 42 miles per day, and they commute 5 days a week, so they commute 42 x 5 = 210 miles per week. Then, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per month. They commute 210 miles per week, and they commute 4 weeks a month, so they commute 210 x 4 = 840 miles per month. Now, we need to find out how many gallons of gas they need per month. Carson's car gets 30 miles per gallon, and they commute 840 miles per month, so they need 840/30 = 28 gallons of gas per month. Finally, we need to find out how much each person pays toward gas monthly. The total cost of gas is $2.50 per gallon, and they need 28 gallons of gas per month, so the total cost of gas is 2.5 x 28 = $70 per month. Since there are 6 people in the carpool (Carson and his 5 friends), each person pays 70/6 = $11.67 toward gas monthly. The answer is 12.\n\n\n"
