  "test_question": "Q: In the first half of a soccer match, team A scores 4 goals while team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A. In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. What's the total number of goals scored in the match?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A soccer team had 24 players prepared for a soccer game. The first half saw 11 players start the game with 2 substitutions made. In the second half, the team made twice as many substitutions as it made in the first half. How many players on the team did not play that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many players played in the first half. We know that 11 players started the game, and 2 substitutions were made, so a total of 13 players played in the first half. Next, we need to find out how many substitutions were made in the second half. We know that the team made twice as many substitutions as it made in the first half, so that means 2 x 2 = 4 substitutions were made in the second half. Now we can calculate how many players played in the second half. We know that there were 13 players who played in the first half, and 4 substitutions were made, so a total of 17 players played in the second half. Finally, we can calculate how many players did not play that day. We know that the team had 24 players prepared for the game, and 13 players played in the first half, and 17 players played in the second half. So, 24 - 13 - 17 = 4 players did not play that day. Therefore, there were 4 players on the team who did not play that day. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Nine hundred tickets were sold to a concert. Three-fourths of those who bought the ticket came before the start of the concert. Five-ninths of the remaining came few minutes after the first song. Eighty people arrived during the middle part of the concert while the rest did not go. How many of those who bought the tickets did not go?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many people came before the start of the concert. Three-fourths of 900 tickets = (3/4) x 900 = 675 people came before the start of the concert. Step 2: Find out how many people were left after the first group came. 900 - 675 = 225 people were left. Step 3: Find out how many people came few minutes after the first song. Five-ninths of the remaining 225 people = (5/9) x 225 = 125 people came few minutes after the first song. Step 4: Find out how many people were left after the second group came. 225 - 125 = 100 people were left. Step 5: Subtract the number of people who arrived during the middle part of the concert from the number of people left. 100 - 80 = 20 people did not go to the concert. Therefore, 20 people who bought the tickets did not go to the concert. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Bertha started with two balls and gave one to her partner, so she has one ball left. Next, we need to figure out how many balls she loses and how many wear out. In 20 games, she loses 20/5 = 4 balls and 20/10 = 2 balls wear out. Finally, we need to figure out how many balls she buys. In 20 games, she buys 20/4 = 5 canisters of three balls, which is a total of 5*3 = 15 balls. So, in total, Bertha has 1 (starting ball) - 4 (lost balls) - 2 (worn out balls) + 15 (bought balls) = 10 tennis balls. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Cleo and Ignacio placed 30 of their marbles in a jar on a Monday. They took 3/5 of the marbles from the jar the next day and divided them equally. On the third day, Cleo took 1/2 of the marbles remaining in the jars. How many marbles did Cleo have on the third day?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many marbles were taken from the jar on the second day. 3/5 of 30 marbles = (3/5) x 30 = 18 marbles So, 18 marbles were taken from the jar on the second day. Step 2: Find out how many marbles were left in the jar after the second day. 30 - 18 = 12 marbles So, 12 marbles were left in the jar after the second day. Step 3: Find out how many marbles Cleo took on the third day. 1/2 of 12 marbles = (1/2) x 12 = 6 marbles So, Cleo took 6 marbles on the third day. Step 4: Find out how many marbles Cleo had on the third day. Cleo had 6 marbles on the third day. Therefore, Cleo had 6 marbles on the third day. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Sally, Sam, and Steve went to play with their marbles. In the beginning, Sam has twice as many marbles as Steve while Sally has 5 less than Sam. After Sam has given Sally and Steve 3 marbles each, Sam has 8 marbles left. How many marbles does Steve have now?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Sam had in the beginning. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve, so let's call the number of marbles Steve had \"x\". This means that Sam had 2x marbles. Next, we know that Sally had 5 less marbles than Sam, so Sally had 2x - 5 marbles. After Sam gave 3 marbles each to Sally and Steve, he was left with 8 marbles. This means that he gave away a total of 6 marbles (3 to Sally and 3 to Steve), so he must have started with 14 marbles (8 + 6 = 14). Now we can use this information to figure out how many marbles Steve has. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve in the beginning, so if Sam had 14 marbles, Steve must have had 7 marbles (14 \u00f7 2 = 7). After Sam gave Steve 3 marbles, Steve now has 10 marbles (7 + 3 = 10). The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: In a school, the number of participants in the 2018 Science Quiz Bowl was 150. There were 20 more than twice the number of participants in 2019 as there were in 2018. In 2020, the number of participants was 40 less than half the number of participants in 2019. How many more participants were there in 2019 than in 2020?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many participants there were in 2019. We know that there were 20 more than twice the number of participants in 2018, so we can set up an equation: 2019 participants = 20 + 2 * 2018 participants 2019 participants = 20 + 2 * 150 2019 participants = 320 Next, we need to find out how many participants there were in 2020. We know that the number of participants in 2020 was 40 less than half the number of participants in 2019, so we can set up another equation: 2020 participants = 0.5 * 2019 participants - 40 2020 participants = 0.5 * 320 - 40 2020 participants = 80 Finally, we can find out how many more participants there were in 2019 than in 2020: 2019 participants - 2020 participants = 320 - 80 = 240 Therefore, there were 240 more participants in 2019 than in 2020. The answer is 2020.\n\n\nQ: Seth bought some boxes of oranges. He gave a box to his mother. He then gave away half of the remaining boxes. If Seth has 4 boxes of oranges left, how many boxes did he buy in the first place?\nA: Let's think step by step. 1. Seth gave a box to his mother, so he had x-1 boxes left. 2. He then gave away half of the remaining boxes, which means he gave away (x-1)/2 boxes. 3. After giving away half of the remaining boxes, he had 4 boxes left. So, we can set up an equation: (x-1)/2 = x-4 4. Solving for x, we can simplify the equation: x-1 = 2(x-4) -> x-1 = 2x-8 -> x = 7 Therefore, Seth bought 7 boxes of oranges in the first place. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\n"
