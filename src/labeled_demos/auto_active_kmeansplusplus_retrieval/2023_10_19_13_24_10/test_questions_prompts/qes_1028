  "test_question": "Q: A teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students. The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so he tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Cleo and Ignacio placed 30 of their marbles in a jar on a Monday. They took 3/5 of the marbles from the jar the next day and divided them equally. On the third day, Cleo took 1/2 of the marbles remaining in the jars. How many marbles did Cleo have on the third day?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many marbles were taken from the jar on the second day. 3/5 of 30 marbles = (3/5) x 30 = 18 marbles So, 18 marbles were taken from the jar on the second day. Step 2: Find out how many marbles were left in the jar after the second day. 30 - 18 = 12 marbles So, 12 marbles were left in the jar after the second day. Step 3: Find out how many marbles Cleo took on the third day. 1/2 of 12 marbles = (1/2) x 12 = 6 marbles So, Cleo took 6 marbles on the third day. Step 4: Find out how many marbles Cleo had on the third day. Cleo had 6 marbles on the third day. Therefore, Cleo had 6 marbles on the third day. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Jerry is sweeping up pieces of broken glass in the parking lot. He sweeps up 20 amber pieces, 35 green pieces, and some clear pieces. If the green pieces are 25% of the total glass he sweeps up, how many pieces were clear?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the green pieces are 25% of the total glass, so we can set up an equation: 35 = 0.25x where x is the total number of pieces of glass Jerry sweeps up. We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.25: x = 140 So Jerry sweeps up a total of 140 pieces of glass. We also know that he sweeps up 20 amber pieces and 35 green pieces, so the number of clear pieces must be: 140 - 20 - 35 = 85 Therefore, Jerry swept up 85 clear pieces of glass. The answer is 85.\n\n\nQ: The toothpaste in Anne's family's bathroom contains 105 grams. Anne's dad uses 3 grams at each brushing, her mom uses 2 grams, Anne and her brother use 1 gram each. Each member of the family brushes their teeth three times a day. How many days will it take for the toothpaste to run out?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many grams of toothpaste are used per day by the family. Anne's dad uses 3 grams x 3 brushings = 9 grams per day. Anne's mom uses 2 grams x 3 brushings = 6 grams per day. Anne and her brother use 1 gram x 2 people x 3 brushings = 6 grams per day. Total toothpaste used per day = 9 + 6 + 6 = 21 grams. Now, let's divide the total amount of toothpaste by the amount used per day to find out how many days it will last. 105 grams \u00f7 21 grams per day = 5 days. Therefore, the toothpaste will last for 5 days. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Tracy has been collecting novels from her friends to donate to the Children For The Future charity organization. In the first week she collects a certain number of books. In the next five weeks, she collects ten times as many books as she did in the first week. How many books did she collect in the first week if she has 99 books now?\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that Tracy collected x number of books in the first week. According to the problem, in the next five weeks, she collected ten times as many books as she did in the first week. So, in the next five weeks, she collected 10x books. Therefore, the total number of books she collected is x + 10x = 11x. We also know that she has 99 books now. So, we can set up an equation: 11x = 99 To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 11: x = 9 Therefore, Tracy collected 9 books in the first week. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Sally, Sam, and Steve went to play with their marbles. In the beginning, Sam has twice as many marbles as Steve while Sally has 5 less than Sam. After Sam has given Sally and Steve 3 marbles each, Sam has 8 marbles left. How many marbles does Steve have now?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Sam had in the beginning. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve, so let's call the number of marbles Steve had \"x\". This means that Sam had 2x marbles. Next, we know that Sally had 5 less marbles than Sam, so Sally had 2x - 5 marbles. After Sam gave 3 marbles each to Sally and Steve, he was left with 8 marbles. This means that he gave away a total of 6 marbles (3 to Sally and 3 to Steve), so he must have started with 14 marbles (8 + 6 = 14). Now we can use this information to figure out how many marbles Steve has. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve in the beginning, so if Sam had 14 marbles, Steve must have had 7 marbles (14 \u00f7 2 = 7). After Sam gave Steve 3 marbles, Steve now has 10 marbles (7 + 3 = 10). The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Bertha started with two balls and gave one to her partner, so she has one ball left. Next, we need to figure out how many balls she loses and how many wear out. In 20 games, she loses 20/5 = 4 balls and 20/10 = 2 balls wear out. Finally, we need to figure out how many balls she buys. In 20 games, she buys 20/4 = 5 canisters of three balls, which is a total of 5*3 = 15 balls. So, in total, Bertha has 1 (starting ball) - 4 (lost balls) - 2 (worn out balls) + 15 (bought balls) = 10 tennis balls. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Dani brings two and half dozen cupcakes for her 2nd-grade class.  There are 27 students (including Dani), 1 teacher, and 1 teacher\u2019s aid.  If 3 students called in sick that day, how many cupcakes are left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Dani brought in total. Two and a half dozen cupcakes is equal to 30 cupcakes (since a dozen is 12). Next, we need to figure out how many people will be receiving cupcakes. There are 27 students, 1 teacher, and 1 teacher's aid, for a total of 29 people. However, 3 students called in sick, so we need to subtract them from the total. 29 - 3 = 26 people receiving cupcakes. Now, we need to subtract 26 cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes Dani brought. 30 - 26 = 4 cupcakes left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class. The answer is 4.\n\n\n"
