  "test_question": "Q: There are 100 plants in Mrs. Smith's garden. One-fourth of her plants are indoor plants. Two-thirds of the remaining are outdoor plants while the rest are flowering plants. What percent of the plants are flowering plants?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: There are four growing trees. The first tree grows 1 meter/day, the second grows the same amount in half the time, the third grows 2 meters/day, and the fourth tree grows a meter more than the third each day. How many meters did the trees grow in total in 4 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much the second tree grows per day. Since it grows the same amount as the first tree in half the time, it grows 2 meters/day. Now we can calculate how much each tree grows in 4 days: - The first tree grows 1 meter/day, so in 4 days it grows 4 meters. - The second tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The third tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The fourth tree grows 1 meter more than the third each day, so it grows 3 meters/day. In 4 days it grows 12 meters. Adding up the growth of all four trees, we get: 4 + 8 + 8 + 12 = 32 meters Therefore, the trees grew a total of 32 meters in 4 days. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Since 1989, Lily has treated herself to 1 hydrangea plant, each year.  Each plant costs $20.00.  By 2021, how much money has Lily spent on hydrangeas?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many years it has been since 1989 to 2021. 2021 - 1989 = 32 years So, Lily has been treating herself to 1 hydrangea plant every year for 32 years. Next, we need to find out how much money Lily has spent on hydrangeas. 1 plant costs $20.00, so: 32 years x $20.00 per plant = $640.00 Therefore, Lily has spent $640.00 on hydrangeas since 1989. The answer is 1989.\n\n\nQ: Fran\u00e7oise sells pots of lily of the valley to fund humanitarian work. She buys them at \u20ac12 each and sells them at a 25% higher cost. How much will she give back to the association by selling 150 pots of lily of the valley?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the selling price of each pot of lily of the valley. Fran\u00e7oise sells them at a 25% higher cost than the buying price of \u20ac12, so we need to add 25% of \u20ac12 to \u20ac12: 25% of \u20ac12 = 0.25 x \u20ac12 = \u20ac3 Selling price = \u20ac12 + \u20ac3 = \u20ac15 Now we know that Fran\u00e7oise sells each pot of lily of the valley for \u20ac15. To calculate how much she will give back to the association by selling 150 pots, we need to multiply the selling price by the number of pots sold: \u20ac15 x 150 = \u20ac2250 Therefore, Fran\u00e7oise will give back \u20ac2250 to the association by selling 150 pots of lily of the valley. The answer is 150.\n\n\nQ: Jerry is sweeping up pieces of broken glass in the parking lot. He sweeps up 20 amber pieces, 35 green pieces, and some clear pieces. If the green pieces are 25% of the total glass he sweeps up, how many pieces were clear?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the green pieces are 25% of the total glass, so we can set up an equation: 35 = 0.25x where x is the total number of pieces of glass Jerry sweeps up. We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.25: x = 140 So Jerry sweeps up a total of 140 pieces of glass. We also know that he sweeps up 20 amber pieces and 35 green pieces, so the number of clear pieces must be: 140 - 20 - 35 = 85 Therefore, Jerry swept up 85 clear pieces of glass. The answer is 85.\n\n\nQ: Nine hundred tickets were sold to a concert. Three-fourths of those who bought the ticket came before the start of the concert. Five-ninths of the remaining came few minutes after the first song. Eighty people arrived during the middle part of the concert while the rest did not go. How many of those who bought the tickets did not go?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many people came before the start of the concert. Three-fourths of 900 tickets = (3/4) x 900 = 675 people came before the start of the concert. Step 2: Find out how many people were left after the first group came. 900 - 675 = 225 people were left. Step 3: Find out how many people came few minutes after the first song. Five-ninths of the remaining 225 people = (5/9) x 225 = 125 people came few minutes after the first song. Step 4: Find out how many people were left after the second group came. 225 - 125 = 100 people were left. Step 5: Subtract the number of people who arrived during the middle part of the concert from the number of people left. 100 - 80 = 20 people did not go to the concert. Therefore, 20 people who bought the tickets did not go to the concert. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: John takes a 10-minute shower every other day for 4 weeks. If his shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute.  How much water does he use in those 4 weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many showers John takes in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks is 4 x 7 = 28 days. Since John takes a shower every other day, he takes 28/2 = 14 showers in 4 weeks. Next, we need to find out how much water he uses per shower. John takes a 10-minute shower, and his shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute. So, he uses 10 x 2 = 20 gallons of water per shower. Finally, we can find out how much water he uses in 4 weeks by multiplying the amount of water per shower by the number of showers he takes: 20 gallons per shower x 14 showers = 280 gallons of water in 4 weeks. Therefore, John uses 280 gallons of water in those 4 weeks. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many students are in Alice's class. We know that there are 40 students and 10 instructors, so the total number of people in the class is 40 + 10 = 50. Next, we need to figure out how many students are bringing their own life vests. We know that 20% of the students are bringing life vests, so we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of students by 0.2: 40 x 0.2 = 8. So 8 students are bringing their own life vests. Now we need to figure out how many life vests we still need. We have 20 life vests on hand, and we need one for each of the 50 people in the class. So we need 50 - 20 = 30 more life vests. However, we already know that 8 students are bringing their own life vests, so we can subtract those from the total number we need: 30 - 8 = 22. Therefore, Alice needs to get 22 more life vests so that the entire class has one. The answer is 22.\n\n\n"
