  "test_question": "Q: James decided to walk to the store.  When he got halfway there he realized he forgot something at home and had to walk back.  If his home is 4 miles from the store and he walks 4 miles per hour how long did it take him to reach the store?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Emery's family decides to travel for a weekend trip. They drive the first 100 miles in 1 hour. They stop at a McDonald's and then continue the rest of the journey for 300 miles. What's the total number of hours they traveled?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, they drove 100 miles in 1 hour. Then, they stopped at McDonald's, which we don't know how long it took. Finally, they continued the rest of the journey for 300 miles. So, the total distance they traveled is 100 + 300 = 400 miles. We know they drove the first 100 miles in 1 hour, but we don't know how long they stopped at McDonald's. Let's call that time \"x\". Then, they drove the remaining 300 miles. Let's call the time it took to drive that distance \"y\". So, the total time they traveled is: 1 hour (for the first 100 miles) + x (for the time they stopped at McDonald's) + y (for the remaining 300 miles) We don't know x or y, but we do know that the total time they traveled is the sum of those three values. Therefore, the answer is: Total time = 1 + x + y hours. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Some friends went hiking for 3.5 hours. They traveled 21 kilometers in that time. Birgit was 4 minutes/km faster than the average time. If Birgit kept the same pace, how many minutes would it take her to go 8 kilometers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the average speed of the group. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken: Average speed = distance/time = 21 km/3.5 hours = 6 km/hour Next, we need to find Birgit's speed. We know that she was 4 minutes/km faster than the average time, which means she completed each kilometer in (60-4) = 56 minutes. So her speed was: Birgit's speed = 1 km/56 minutes = 0.018 km/minute Finally, we need to find how long it would take Birgit to travel 8 kilometers at this speed. We can use the formula: Time = distance/speed Time = 8 km / 0.018 km/minute = 444.44 minutes So it would take Birgit approximately 444.44 minutes to travel 8 kilometers at the same pace. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Francine drives 140km to work each day. If she does not go to work 3 days every week, find the total distance she drives to work for 4 weeks in kilometers.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days Francine goes to work in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 x 7 = 28 days. If Francine does not go to work 3 days every week, then she goes to work 7 - 3 = 4 days every week. So in 4 weeks, she goes to work 4 x 4 = 16 days. Now we can find the total distance she drives to work in 4 weeks by multiplying the distance she drives to work each day by the number of days she goes to work in 4 weeks. Total distance = 140 km/day x 16 days = 2240 km Therefore, Francine drives a total of 2240 kilometers to work in 4 weeks. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Jessica just got her driving permit. She must complete 50 hours of driving with a parent to get her driver\u2019s license. It takes 20 minutes to drive to school. If she drives to and from school every day, how many school days will it take Jessica to meet the 50-hour driving requirement?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much time Jessica spends driving to and from school each day. She drives to school and back, so that's a total of 2 trips. Each trip takes 20 minutes, so she spends 40 minutes driving to and from school each day. Next, we need to figure out how many minutes of driving Jessica needs to complete in order to reach the 50-hour requirement. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 50 hours is equal to 50 x 60 = 3000 minutes. Now we can divide the total minutes of driving required by the number of minutes Jessica spends driving each day: 3000 / 40 = 75. So Jessica needs to drive for 75 school days in order to complete the 50-hour driving requirement. The answer is 50.\n\n\nQ: Jill can run up a hill at 9 feet/second and down a hill at 12 feet/second. How long does it take her to run up and down a 900 foot hill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for Jill to run up the hill. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed The distance she runs up the hill is 900 feet, and her speed is 9 feet/second. So: time up = 900 / 9 = 100 seconds Next, we need to find the time it takes for Jill to run down the hill. Again, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed The distance she runs down the hill is also 900 feet, but her speed is 12 feet/second. So: time down = 900 / 12 = 75 seconds Finally, we need to find the total time it takes for Jill to run up and down the hill. Since she runs up and down separately, we can just add the two times: total time = time up + time down = 100 + 75 = 175 seconds Therefore, it takes Jill 175 seconds to run up and down a 900 foot hill. The answer is 900.\n\n\nQ: James writes a comic every other day for 4 years. If there was no leap year, how many comics has he written?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days there are in 4 years. Since there are 365 days in a year, we can multiply 365 by 4 to get: 365 x 4 = 1460 days Next, we need to figure out how many comics James writes in every other day. Since he writes a comic every other day, we can divide the total number of days by 2 to get: 1460 / 2 = 730 comics Therefore, James has written 730 comics in 4 years if there was no leap year. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: To get to an island called \"Virgo\", Tom needs to travel by plane and then by boat. The plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, and the boat trip takes up to 2 hours. In how many hours is Tom able to get to the \"Virgo\" island?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long the plane trip is. We know that the plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, so we can set up an equation: plane trip = 4 * boat trip Since we know the boat trip takes 2 hours, we can substitute that in: plane trip = 4 * 2 plane trip = 8 So the plane trip is 8 hours. Now we just need to add the plane trip and the boat trip together to find the total time: total time = plane trip + boat trip total time = 8 + 2 total time = 10 So Tom is able to get to the \"Virgo\" island in 10 hours. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: There are four growing trees. The first tree grows 1 meter/day, the second grows the same amount in half the time, the third grows 2 meters/day, and the fourth tree grows a meter more than the third each day. How many meters did the trees grow in total in 4 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much the second tree grows per day. Since it grows the same amount as the first tree in half the time, it grows 2 meters/day. Now we can calculate how much each tree grows in 4 days: - The first tree grows 1 meter/day, so in 4 days it grows 4 meters. - The second tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The third tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The fourth tree grows 1 meter more than the third each day, so it grows 3 meters/day. In 4 days it grows 12 meters. Adding up the growth of all four trees, we get: 4 + 8 + 8 + 12 = 32 meters Therefore, the trees grew a total of 32 meters in 4 days. The answer is 4.\n\n\n"
