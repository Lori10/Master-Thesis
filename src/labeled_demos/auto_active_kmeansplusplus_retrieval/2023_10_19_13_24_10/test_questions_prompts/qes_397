  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Sally, Sam, and Steve went to play with their marbles. In the beginning, Sam has twice as many marbles as Steve while Sally has 5 less than Sam. After Sam has given Sally and Steve 3 marbles each, Sam has 8 marbles left. How many marbles does Steve have now?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Sam had in the beginning. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve, so let's call the number of marbles Steve had \"x\". This means that Sam had 2x marbles. Next, we know that Sally had 5 less marbles than Sam, so Sally had 2x - 5 marbles. After Sam gave 3 marbles each to Sally and Steve, he was left with 8 marbles. This means that he gave away a total of 6 marbles (3 to Sally and 3 to Steve), so he must have started with 14 marbles (8 + 6 = 14). Now we can use this information to figure out how many marbles Steve has. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve in the beginning, so if Sam had 14 marbles, Steve must have had 7 marbles (14 \u00f7 2 = 7). After Sam gave Steve 3 marbles, Steve now has 10 marbles (7 + 3 = 10). The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Bertha started with two balls and gave one to her partner, so she has one ball left. Next, we need to figure out how many balls she loses and how many wear out. In 20 games, she loses 20/5 = 4 balls and 20/10 = 2 balls wear out. Finally, we need to figure out how many balls she buys. In 20 games, she buys 20/4 = 5 canisters of three balls, which is a total of 5*3 = 15 balls. So, in total, Bertha has 1 (starting ball) - 4 (lost balls) - 2 (worn out balls) + 15 (bought balls) = 10 tennis balls. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Nori had 4 boxes of crayons with 8 crayons in each box. She gave 5 crayons to Mae and also give some crayons to Lea. How many more crayons did she give to Lea than Mae if she has only 15 crayons left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many crayons Nori had in total. 4 boxes x 8 crayons per box = 32 crayons Next, we need to subtract the 5 crayons Nori gave to Mae. 32 crayons - 5 crayons = 27 crayons We know that Nori has 15 crayons left, so we can subtract that from the 27 crayons to find out how many crayons she gave to Lea. 27 crayons - 15 crayons = 12 crayons Therefore, Nori gave 12 crayons to Lea. To find out how many more crayons Nori gave to Lea than Mae, we can subtract the 5 crayons from Mae from the 12 crayons given to Lea. 12 crayons - 5 crayons = 7 crayons So Nori gave 7 more crayons to Lea than Mae. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Jerry is sweeping up pieces of broken glass in the parking lot. He sweeps up 20 amber pieces, 35 green pieces, and some clear pieces. If the green pieces are 25% of the total glass he sweeps up, how many pieces were clear?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the green pieces are 25% of the total glass, so we can set up an equation: 35 = 0.25x where x is the total number of pieces of glass Jerry sweeps up. We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.25: x = 140 So Jerry sweeps up a total of 140 pieces of glass. We also know that he sweeps up 20 amber pieces and 35 green pieces, so the number of clear pieces must be: 140 - 20 - 35 = 85 Therefore, Jerry swept up 85 clear pieces of glass. The answer is 85.\n\n\nQ: Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Phill cuts the pizza in half, which gives him 2 slices. Then he cuts both halves in half, which gives him 4 slices. And then he cuts each slice in half again, which gives him 8 slices in total. Next, Phill passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends, which means he gives away 3 slices in total. He also passes out 2 slices to 2 of his friends, which means he gives away 4 slices in total. Therefore, Phill has given away a total of 7 slices of pizza. If he started with 8 slices, then he has 1 slice left for himself. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Phoebe has two pizzas to share with her and three friends. One has pepperoni and the other has cheese. They both have 16 slices. They all eat the same amount. One friend eats only pepperoni, while the rest have an equal number of slices of each. At the end, there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese, how many slices does each person eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 2 pizzas with 16 slices each, so there are a total of 32 slices. Next, we know that one friend only eats pepperoni, so they eat one slice from the pepperoni pizza. That leaves 31 slices, with 15 slices from each pizza. We also know that there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese left. So, the remaining 15 slices are divided equally among the remaining 3 friends, which means each of them eats 5 slices. Therefore, each person eats 1 slice of pepperoni and 5 slices of cheese. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. If Mabel has 85 marbles, how many more marbles does Mabel have than Amanda?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Katrina has. We know that Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 85 marbles, so we can set up an equation: Mabel's marbles = 5 x Katrina's marbles 85 = 5 x Katrina's marbles Katrina's marbles = 17 Now we know that Katrina has 17 marbles. We also know that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. So we can set up another equation: Amanda's marbles = 2 x Katrina's marbles + 12 Amanda's marbles = 2 x 17 + 12 Amanda's marbles = 46 So Amanda has 46 marbles. Finally, we can figure out how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda: Mabel's marbles - Amanda's marbles = 85 - 46 Mabel's marbles - Amanda's marbles = 39 Therefore, Mabel has 39 more marbles than Amanda. The answer is 39.\n\n\n"
