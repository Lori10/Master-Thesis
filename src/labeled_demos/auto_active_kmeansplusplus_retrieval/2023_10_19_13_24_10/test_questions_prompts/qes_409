  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Xena is trying to outrun a dragon to get to the safety of a cave it's too big to fit into. Xena has a 600 foot head start, but the dragon can burn her if it gets within 120 feet of her. If Xena runs 15 feet per second and the dragon flies 30 feet per second, how many seconds does Xena have to get to the cave?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how fast the dragon can catch up to Xena. The dragon can cover 30 - 15 = 15 feet per second faster than Xena. Next, we need to find out how far the dragon needs to travel to catch up to Xena. This distance is 600 - 120 = 480 feet. Finally, we can use the formula distance = rate x time to find out how long Xena has to get to the cave. We can set up the equation as follows: 480 = 15t + 30t Simplifying the equation, we get: 480 = 45t Dividing both sides by 45, we get: t = 10.67 seconds Therefore, Xena has 10.67 seconds to get to the cave before the dragon catches up to her. The answer is 11.\n\n\nQ: Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. If Mabel has 85 marbles, how many more marbles does Mabel have than Amanda?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Katrina has. We know that Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 85 marbles, so we can set up an equation: Mabel's marbles = 5 x Katrina's marbles 85 = 5 x Katrina's marbles Katrina's marbles = 17 Now we know that Katrina has 17 marbles. We also know that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. So we can set up another equation: Amanda's marbles = 2 x Katrina's marbles + 12 Amanda's marbles = 2 x 17 + 12 Amanda's marbles = 46 So Amanda has 46 marbles. Finally, we can figure out how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda: Mabel's marbles - Amanda's marbles = 85 - 46 Mabel's marbles - Amanda's marbles = 39 Therefore, Mabel has 39 more marbles than Amanda. The answer is 39.\n\n\nQ: Jen and Tyler are gymnasts practicing flips. Jen is practicing the triple-flip while Tyler is practicing the double-flip. Jen did sixteen triple-flips during practice. Tyler flipped in the air half the number of times Jen did. How many double-flips did Tyler do?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many flips Tyler did in total. We know that Tyler did half the number of flips that Jen did, and Jen did 16 triple-flips. So, Tyler did: 16 triple-flips x 3 flips per triple-flip = 48 flips 48 flips / 2 = 24 flips Now we know that Tyler did 24 flips in total. We also know that Tyler was practicing double-flips, so we need to divide the total number of flips by 2 to find out how many double-flips he did: 24 flips / 2 = 12 double-flips Therefore, Tyler did 12 double-flips during practice. The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: There are four growing trees. The first tree grows 1 meter/day, the second grows the same amount in half the time, the third grows 2 meters/day, and the fourth tree grows a meter more than the third each day. How many meters did the trees grow in total in 4 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much the second tree grows per day. Since it grows the same amount as the first tree in half the time, it grows 2 meters/day. Now we can calculate how much each tree grows in 4 days: - The first tree grows 1 meter/day, so in 4 days it grows 4 meters. - The second tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The third tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The fourth tree grows 1 meter more than the third each day, so it grows 3 meters/day. In 4 days it grows 12 meters. Adding up the growth of all four trees, we get: 4 + 8 + 8 + 12 = 32 meters Therefore, the trees grew a total of 32 meters in 4 days. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: James wants to build a ladder to climb a very tall tree.  Each rung of the ladder is 18 inches long and they are 6 inches apart.  If he needs to climb 50 feet how many feet of wood will he need for the rungs?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 50 feet to inches since the length of the rungs is given in inches. 50 feet = 600 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches) Next, we need to figure out how many rungs James will need. We know that each rung is 18 inches long and they are 6 inches apart. So, the total length of each \"rung + gap\" is 24 inches. To find the number of rungs, we can divide the total height of the ladder (600 inches) by the length of each \"rung + gap\" (24 inches). 600 inches \u00f7 24 inches = 25 rungs Finally, we can calculate the total length of wood needed for the rungs by multiplying the length of each rung (18 inches) by the number of rungs (25). 18 inches x 25 rungs = 450 inches To convert this back to feet, we divide by 12: 450 inches \u00f7 12 inches/foot = 37.5 feet So James will need 37.5 feet of wood for the rungs of his ladder. The answer is 38.\n\n\nQ: Timmy, Tommy and Tina are filling up a kiddie pool in their backyard.  Each has a pail they fill with water from a house before dumping it into the pool.  If Timmy's pail holds twice as much water as Tommy's, and Tommy's holds 2 gallons more than Tina's, and Tina's is 4 gallons, how much water do the three of them fill the pool with after 3 trips each?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much water each pail can hold. We know that Tina's pail holds 4 gallons. Tommy's pail holds 2 more gallons than Tina's, so it holds 4 + 2 = 6 gallons. Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's, so it holds 6 x 2 = 12 gallons. Now we know how much water each pail can hold, we can figure out how much water they can fill the pool with after 1 trip each. Together, they can fill the pool with 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 gallons of water. After 3 trips each, they will have filled the pool with 22 x 3 = 66 gallons of water. The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: Jill can run up a hill at 9 feet/second and down a hill at 12 feet/second. How long does it take her to run up and down a 900 foot hill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for Jill to run up the hill. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed The distance she runs up the hill is 900 feet, and her speed is 9 feet/second. So: time up = 900 / 9 = 100 seconds Next, we need to find the time it takes for Jill to run down the hill. Again, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed The distance she runs down the hill is also 900 feet, but her speed is 12 feet/second. So: time down = 900 / 12 = 75 seconds Finally, we need to find the total time it takes for Jill to run up and down the hill. Since she runs up and down separately, we can just add the two times: total time = time up + time down = 100 + 75 = 175 seconds Therefore, it takes Jill 175 seconds to run up and down a 900 foot hill. The answer is 900.\n\n\nQ: Padma is trading cards with Robert. Padma started with 75 cards and traded 2 or her valuable ones for 10 of Robert's cards. Robert started with 88 of his own cards and traded another 8 of his cards for 15 of Padma's cards. How many cards were traded between both Padma and Robert?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Padma traded 2 of her cards for 10 of Robert's cards. This means she now has 75 - 2 + 10 = 83 cards, and Robert has 88 - 10 = 78 cards. Next, Robert traded 8 of his cards for 15 of Padma's cards. This means he now has 78 - 8 = 70 cards, and Padma has 83 - 15 = 68 cards. In total, Padma traded 2 + 15 = 17 cards, and Robert traded 10 + 8 = 18 cards. Therefore, the total number of cards traded between both Padma and Robert is 17 + 18 = 35 cards. The answer is 35.\n\n\n"
