  "test_question": "Q: Jeff owns a catering company.  During a recent event, he sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates for the party.  When they were returned, 10 glasses were broken as well as 6 plates.  How many glasses and plates does Jeff have now?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Jerry is sweeping up pieces of broken glass in the parking lot. He sweeps up 20 amber pieces, 35 green pieces, and some clear pieces. If the green pieces are 25% of the total glass he sweeps up, how many pieces were clear?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the green pieces are 25% of the total glass, so we can set up an equation: 35 = 0.25x where x is the total number of pieces of glass Jerry sweeps up. We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.25: x = 140 So Jerry sweeps up a total of 140 pieces of glass. We also know that he sweeps up 20 amber pieces and 35 green pieces, so the number of clear pieces must be: 140 - 20 - 35 = 85 Therefore, Jerry swept up 85 clear pieces of glass. The answer is 85.\n\n\nQ: Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Phill cuts the pizza in half, which gives him 2 slices. Then he cuts both halves in half, which gives him 4 slices. And then he cuts each slice in half again, which gives him 8 slices in total. Next, Phill passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends, which means he gives away 3 slices in total. He also passes out 2 slices to 2 of his friends, which means he gives away 4 slices in total. Therefore, Phill has given away a total of 7 slices of pizza. If he started with 8 slices, then he has 1 slice left for himself. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Mary wants 144 cupcakes for her party. Mary has already made 36 cherry cupcakes, and 48 berry cupcakes. Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes for the rest. How much of each should she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Mary has already made: 36 cherry + 48 berry = 84 cupcakes Next, we need to figure out how many more cupcakes Mary needs to make: 144 total cupcakes - 84 cupcakes already made = 60 cupcakes Since Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, we can divide the remaining 60 cupcakes by 2: 60 cupcakes \u00f7 2 = 30 cupcakes of each flavor Therefore, Mary should make 30 chocolate cupcakes and 30 vanilla cupcakes to have a total of 144 cupcakes for her party. The answer is 144.\n\n\nQ: Jeff has a shelter where he currently takes care of 20 cats. On Monday he found 2 kittens in a box and took them to the shelter. On Tuesday he found 1 more cat with a leg injury. On Wednesday 3 people adopted 2 cats each. How many cats does Jeff currently have in his shelter?\nA: Let's think step by step. Jeff had 20 cats in his shelter. On Monday he found 2 kittens and took them to the shelter, so he now has 20 + 2 = 22 cats. On Tuesday he found 1 more cat with a leg injury, so he now has 22 + 1 = 23 cats. On Wednesday, 3 people adopted 2 cats each, which means a total of 3 x 2 = 6 cats were adopted. Therefore, Jeff currently has 23 - 6 = 17 cats in his shelter. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: One serving of soup has 1 cup of vegetables and 2.5 cups of broth. How many pints of vegetables and broth combined would be needed for 8 servings?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total amount of soup in cups for 8 servings. One serving has 1 cup of vegetables and 2.5 cups of broth, so one serving of soup is 1 + 2.5 = 3.5 cups. To find the total amount of soup for 8 servings, we can multiply the amount for one serving by 8: 3.5 cups/serving x 8 servings = 28 cups of soup Now we need to find the amount of pints in 28 cups. There are 2 cups in a pint, so we can divide 28 cups by 2 to get the amount in pints: 28 cups \u00f7 2 cups/pint = 14 pints Therefore, we would need 14 pints of vegetables and broth combined for 8 servings of soup. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Dani brings two and half dozen cupcakes for her 2nd-grade class.  There are 27 students (including Dani), 1 teacher, and 1 teacher\u2019s aid.  If 3 students called in sick that day, how many cupcakes are left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Dani brought in total. Two and a half dozen cupcakes is equal to 30 cupcakes (since a dozen is 12). Next, we need to figure out how many people will be receiving cupcakes. There are 27 students, 1 teacher, and 1 teacher's aid, for a total of 29 people. However, 3 students called in sick, so we need to subtract them from the total. 29 - 3 = 26 people receiving cupcakes. Now, we need to subtract 26 cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes Dani brought. 30 - 26 = 4 cupcakes left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: A local restaurant is offering an 8 piece fried chicken bucket and 2 sides for $12.00 that will feed 6 people.  If Monty was having a family reunion for 36 family members, how much will it cost him to buy enough chicken and sides to feed everyone one serving?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many servings of chicken and sides Monty needs to feed 36 people. Since the restaurant's 8 piece fried chicken bucket feeds 6 people, we can calculate that Monty needs 6 buckets of chicken to feed 36 people. Next, we need to figure out how many sides Monty needs. The restaurant offers 2 sides with each 8 piece chicken bucket, so Monty needs 6 x 2 = 12 sides. Now, we can calculate the total cost. Monty is paying $12.00 for 6 people, so he needs to pay 6/6 = 1 dollar per person. To feed 36 people, Monty needs to pay 36 x 1 = $36.00 for the chicken and sides. The answer is 36.\n\n\n"
