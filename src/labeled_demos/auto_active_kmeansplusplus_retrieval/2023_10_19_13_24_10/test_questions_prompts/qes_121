  "test_question": "Q: John decides to buy new phones for him, his 2 kids, and his wife.  Each phone after the first 2 is half price.  If the phone price is $600 how much did he pay for them all?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: John buys 500 newspapers.  Each newspaper sells for $2.  He sells 80% of them.  He buys them all for 75% less than the price at which he sells them.  How much profit does he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much John buys the newspapers for. He buys them for 75% less than the price at which he sells them, which means he buys them for 25% of the selling price. 25% of the selling price = 0.25 x 2 = $0.50 So, John buys each newspaper for $0.50. Next, let's calculate how much John earns from selling the newspapers. He sells 80% of the 500 newspapers, which is: 0.8 x 500 = 400 newspapers He sells each newspaper for $2, so his total earnings are: 400 x 2 = $800 Now, let's calculate how much John spent on buying the newspapers: 500 x 0.50 = $250 Therefore, John's profit is: $800 - $250 = $550 So, John makes a profit of $550. The answer is 550.\n\n\nQ: Michael has $42. Michael gives away half the money to his brother. His brother then buys 3 dollars worth of candy. If his brother has $35 left, how much money, in dollars, did his brother have at first?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Michael had $42. Next, he gave away half of that money to his brother, which is $21. His brother then spent $3 on candy, leaving him with $35. To figure out how much money his brother had at first, we need to work backwards. If his brother had $35 after spending $3 on candy, then he had $38 before buying the candy. And if his brother received $21 from Michael, then he must have had $17 to begin with. Therefore, his brother had $17 at first. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Jim buys a wedding ring for $10,000.  He gets his wife a ring that is twice that much and sells the first one for half its value.  How much is he out of pocket?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Jim buys a wedding ring for $10,000. Next, we know that he gets his wife a ring that is twice that much, which means he spends $20,000 on her ring. Now, he sells the first ring for half its value, which means he sells it for $5,000. To find out how much Jim is out of pocket, we need to add up all of his expenses and subtract any income he received from selling the first ring. So, Jim's total expenses are $10,000 + $20,000 = $30,000. His income from selling the first ring is $5,000. Therefore, Jim is out of pocket $30,000 - $5,000 = $25,000. The answer is 25000.\n\n\nQ: Jill spends time every day talking to her boyfriend on the phone.  The first day of the week she spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend.  Each of the following days she spends twice as much time talking on the phone as the day before. After the 5th day her parents take the phone away from her because she was on it too long.  How much time did Jill spend talking to her boyfriend that week?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Jill spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend. On the second day, she spends twice as much time as the first day, which is 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 minutes. On the third day, she spends twice as much time as the second day, which is 2*10=<<2*10=20>>20 minutes. On the fourth day, she spends twice as much time as the third day, which is 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 minutes. On the fifth day, she spends twice as much time as the fourth day, which is 2*40=<<2*40=80>>80 minutes. Therefore, Jill spends a total of 5+10+20+40+80=<<5+10+20+40+80=155>>155 minutes talking to her boyfriend that week. The answer is 155.\n\n\nQ: A math teacher had $100 to buy three different types of calculators. A basic calculator costs $8. A scientific calculator costs twice the price as the basic while a graphing calculator costs thrice the price as the scientific. How much change did she receive after buying those three different types of calculators?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many calculators of each type the teacher can buy with $100. Let's start with the basic calculator. Each basic calculator costs $8, so the teacher can buy 100/8 = 12.5 basic calculators. Since we can't buy half a calculator, we'll round down to 12 basic calculators. Next, let's figure out how many scientific calculators the teacher can buy. Each scientific calculator costs twice as much as a basic calculator, so it costs $8 x 2 = $16. With $100, the teacher can buy 100/16 = 6.25 scientific calculators. Again, we'll round down to 6 scientific calculators. Finally, let's figure out how many graphing calculators the teacher can buy. Each graphing calculator costs three times as much as a scientific calculator, so it costs $16 x 3 = $48. With $100, the teacher can buy 100/48 = 2.08 graphing calculators. We'll round down to 2 graphing calculators. So in total, the teacher can buy 12 basic calculators, 6 scientific calculators, and 2 graphing calculators. The cost of the basic calculators is 12 x $8 = $96. The cost of the scientific calculators is 6 x $16 = $96. The cost of the graphing calculators is 2 x $48 = $96. So the total cost of all the calculators is $96 + $96 + $96 = $288. The teacher started with $100, so she received $100 - $288 = -$188 in change. However, since she didn't have enough money to buy all the calculators she wanted, she actually owes $188. The answer is 188.\n\n\nQ: Lorie has 2 pieces of $100 bills. He requested to change one piece of the $100 bills into $50 bills. Half of the remaining $100 bill is changed to $10 bills while the rest is changed to $5 bills. How many pieces of bills will she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Lorie has 2 pieces of $100 bills, which means she has a total of $200. Next, she changes one piece of the $100 bill into $50 bills. One piece of $100 bill is equal to 2 pieces of $50 bills, so she now has a total of $200 - $100 + $100 = $200. Half of the remaining $100 bill is changed to $10 bills. Half of $100 is $50, so she changes $50 into $10 bills. $50 divided by $10 is 5, so she now has 5 pieces of $10 bills. The rest of the remaining $100 bill is changed to $5 bills. The remaining amount is $50, and $50 divided by $5 is 10, so she now has 10 pieces of $5 bills. Therefore, Lorie now has a total of 2 pieces of $50 bills, 5 pieces of $10 bills, and 10 pieces of $5 bills, which is a total of 17 pieces of bills. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Grant spends $200.00 a year to have the newspaper delivered daily to his house.  Juanita buys the newspaper daily.  Monday through Saturday, she spends $0.50 and on Sunday she spends $2.00.  How much more money does Juanita spend buying the newspaper yearly than Grant?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper daily from Monday to Saturday: $0.50 x 6 = $3.00 Now, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper on Sundays: $2.00 x 1 = $2.00 Next, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper weekly: $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00 Finally, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper yearly: $5.00 x 52 = $260.00 Now, let's calculate the difference between what Juanita spends and what Grant spends: $260.00 - $200.00 = $60.00 Therefore, Juanita spends $60.00 more buying the newspaper yearly than Grant. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Five people are planning a party. Sonja will buy a loaf of French bread ($3 a loaf) and a platter of cold cuts ($23). Barbara will buy the soda ($1 per person) and two boxes of crackers ($2 per box). Mario and Rick will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles ($3 per package). Danica will supply a package of paper plates for $4. How much more will Sonja spend than the rest of the office put together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of Barbara's contribution. She will buy soda for 5 people, which will cost $5 (1 dollar per person). She will also buy two boxes of crackers, which will cost $4 (2 dollars per box). Therefore, Barbara's total contribution will be $9. Next, let's calculate the total cost of Mario and Rick's contribution. They will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles, which will cost $6 in total (3 dollars per package). Now, let's add up the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's. Barbara's contribution is $9, Mario and Rick's contribution is $6, and Danica's contribution is $4. Therefore, the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's is $19. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of Sonja's contribution. She will buy a loaf of French bread for $3 and a platter of cold cuts for $23. Therefore, Sonja's total contribution will be $26. To find out how much more Sonja will spend than the rest of the office put together, we need to subtract the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's from Sonja's total contribution. $26 (Sonja's contribution) - $19 (total cost of everyone else's contribution) = $7 Therefore, Sonja will spend $7 more than the rest of the office put together. The answer is 7.\n\n\n"
