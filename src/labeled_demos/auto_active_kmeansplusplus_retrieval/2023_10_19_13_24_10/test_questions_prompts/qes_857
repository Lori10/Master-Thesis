  "test_question": "Q: Shiloh is 44 years old today.  In 7 years, he will be three times as old as his nephew.  How old is his nephew today?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Karina was born in 1970 and she is currently twice as old as her brother. If her current age is 40, in what year was her brother born?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Karina's current age is 40. We also know that she is currently twice as old as her brother. Therefore, we can set up an equation: 40 = 2x where x is her brother's current age. Solving for x, we get: x = 20 So Karina's brother is currently 20 years old. Next, we need to figure out in what year he was born. We know that Karina was born in 1970, so we can subtract her brother's age from that year: 1970 - 20 = 1950 Therefore, Karina's brother was born in 1950. The answer is 1950.\n\n\nQ: Tom turned 32 years old 5 years ago.  7 years ago Jim was 5 years older than half Tom's age.  How old is Jim in 2 years?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find Tom's current age. We know that he turned 32 years old 5 years ago, so we can add 32 and 5 to get his current age: Tom's current age = 32 + 5 = 37 Next, we need to figure out how old Jim was 7 years ago. We know that 7 years ago, Jim was 5 years older than half of Tom's age. Half of Tom's age is: 37 / 2 = 18.5 So 7 years ago, Jim was: 18.5 + 5 = 23.5 Now we need to find Jim's current age. We know that 7 years have passed since we calculated Jim's age, so we need to add 7 to his age: Jim's current age = 23.5 + 7 = 30.5 Finally, we need to find Jim's age in 2 years. We can simply add 2 to his current age: Jim's age in 2 years = 30.5 + 2 = 32.5 Therefore, Jim will be 32.5 years old in 2 years. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: James writes a comic every other day for 4 years. If there was no leap year, how many comics has he written?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days there are in 4 years. Since there are 365 days in a year, we can multiply 365 by 4 to get: 365 x 4 = 1460 days Next, we need to figure out how many comics James writes in every other day. Since he writes a comic every other day, we can divide the total number of days by 2 to get: 1460 / 2 = 730 comics Therefore, James has written 730 comics in 4 years if there was no leap year. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Four classmates were comparing their ages based on their birth month. They found out that Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese while Therese is 5 months older than Aivo. Then, Leon is 2 months older than Aivo. How much older in months is Jolyn than Leon?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine the age difference between Aivo and Therese. We know that Therese is 5 months older than Aivo. Next, we need to determine the age difference between Jolyn and Therese. We know that Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese. Then, we need to determine the age difference between Leon and Aivo. We know that Leon is 2 months older than Aivo. To find the age difference between Jolyn and Leon, we need to add up the age differences between Jolyn and Therese, Therese and Aivo, and Aivo and Leon. (2 months + 5 months + 2 months) = 9 months Therefore, Jolyn is 9 months older than Leon. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Horatio is a poet composing sonnets for his lady fair. He believes it will take many of his sonnets to win her over. Each sonnet is fourteen lines long. His lady fair tells him to leave her alone after he reads her only seven sonnets, and Horatio is heartbroken over the 70 romantic lines he wrote that she never heard. How many sonnets did Horatio write in all?\nA: Let's think step by step. Horatio wrote 70 lines of poetry that his lady fair never heard. Since each sonnet is 14 lines long, we can divide the total number of lines by 14 to find out how many sonnets Horatio wrote. 70 \u00f7 14 = 5 Horatio wrote 5 sonnets in total. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Michael has $42. Michael gives away half the money to his brother. His brother then buys 3 dollars worth of candy. If his brother has $35 left, how much money, in dollars, did his brother have at first?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Michael had $42. Next, he gave away half of that money to his brother, which is $21. His brother then spent $3 on candy, leaving him with $35. To figure out how much money his brother had at first, we need to work backwards. If his brother had $35 after spending $3 on candy, then he had $38 before buying the candy. And if his brother received $21 from Michael, then he must have had $17 to begin with. Therefore, his brother had $17 at first. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Jill spends time every day talking to her boyfriend on the phone.  The first day of the week she spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend.  Each of the following days she spends twice as much time talking on the phone as the day before. After the 5th day her parents take the phone away from her because she was on it too long.  How much time did Jill spend talking to her boyfriend that week?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Jill spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend. On the second day, she spends twice as much time as the first day, which is 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 minutes. On the third day, she spends twice as much time as the second day, which is 2*10=<<2*10=20>>20 minutes. On the fourth day, she spends twice as much time as the third day, which is 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 minutes. On the fifth day, she spends twice as much time as the fourth day, which is 2*40=<<2*40=80>>80 minutes. Therefore, Jill spends a total of 5+10+20+40+80=<<5+10+20+40+80=155>>155 minutes talking to her boyfriend that week. The answer is 155.\n\n\n"
