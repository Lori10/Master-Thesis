  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Samuel is going to the cinema with his brother, Kevin. They both have a total budget of $20 for their outing. Samuel buys his $14 ticket, then spends $6 on drinks and food. Kevin buys his ticket, then spends $2 on drinks. They have both used their entire budget. How much did Kevin spend on food?\nA: Let's think step by step. Samuel spent $14 on his ticket and $6 on food and drinks, which means he spent a total of $20. This means that Kevin must have spent $0 on food and drinks, since they both used their entire budget of $20. Therefore, Kevin spent $6 on his ticket and $2 on drinks, which means he spent a total of $8. Since he didn't spend any money on food, the answer is $0. The answer is 0.\n\n\nQ: Jenny signs up for dinner theater with 5 of her friends. Each person pays $50 for the ticket and $10 for their entr\u00e9e, and half the people also buy unlimited drink tickets for $30/person. Then the dinner theater is canceled due to COVID, and each person gets a 90% refund. How much money did the group of six friends lose?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total cost per person. Each person pays $50 for the ticket and $10 for their entr\u00e9e, so the total cost per person is $50 + $10 = $60. Half of the people also buy unlimited drink tickets for $30/person, so three people buy drink tickets. The total cost per person for those who bought drink tickets is $60 + $30 = $90. Now we can calculate the total cost for the group of six friends. Since there are three people who bought drink tickets and three who didn't, we can calculate the total cost as follows: Total cost = (3 people x $90/person) + (3 people x $60/person) Total cost = $270 + $180 Total cost = $450 However, the dinner theater was canceled due to COVID, and each person gets a 90% refund. Therefore, the group of six friends will only get back 90% of the total cost, which is: Refund = 90% x $450 Refund = $405 Therefore, the group of six friends lost $450 - $405 = $45 in total. The answer is 45.\n\n\nQ: Lorie has 2 pieces of $100 bills. He requested to change one piece of the $100 bills into $50 bills. Half of the remaining $100 bill is changed to $10 bills while the rest is changed to $5 bills. How many pieces of bills will she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Lorie has 2 pieces of $100 bills, which means she has a total of $200. Next, she changes one piece of the $100 bill into $50 bills. One piece of $100 bill is equal to 2 pieces of $50 bills, so she now has a total of $200 - $100 + $100 = $200. Half of the remaining $100 bill is changed to $10 bills. Half of $100 is $50, so she changes $50 into $10 bills. $50 divided by $10 is 5, so she now has 5 pieces of $10 bills. The rest of the remaining $100 bill is changed to $5 bills. The remaining amount is $50, and $50 divided by $5 is 10, so she now has 10 pieces of $5 bills. Therefore, Lorie now has a total of 2 pieces of $50 bills, 5 pieces of $10 bills, and 10 pieces of $5 bills, which is a total of 17 pieces of bills. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Five people are planning a party. Sonja will buy a loaf of French bread ($3 a loaf) and a platter of cold cuts ($23). Barbara will buy the soda ($1 per person) and two boxes of crackers ($2 per box). Mario and Rick will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles ($3 per package). Danica will supply a package of paper plates for $4. How much more will Sonja spend than the rest of the office put together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of Barbara's contribution. She will buy soda for 5 people, which will cost $5 (1 dollar per person). She will also buy two boxes of crackers, which will cost $4 (2 dollars per box). Therefore, Barbara's total contribution will be $9. Next, let's calculate the total cost of Mario and Rick's contribution. They will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles, which will cost $6 in total (3 dollars per package). Now, let's add up the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's. Barbara's contribution is $9, Mario and Rick's contribution is $6, and Danica's contribution is $4. Therefore, the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's is $19. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of Sonja's contribution. She will buy a loaf of French bread for $3 and a platter of cold cuts for $23. Therefore, Sonja's total contribution will be $26. To find out how much more Sonja will spend than the rest of the office put together, we need to subtract the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's from Sonja's total contribution. $26 (Sonja's contribution) - $19 (total cost of everyone else's contribution) = $7 Therefore, Sonja will spend $7 more than the rest of the office put together. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Each week Jaime saves $50. Every two weeks she spends $46 of her savings on a nice lunch with her mum. How long will it take her to save $135?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much money Jaime saves in a week after spending $46 every two weeks on lunch with her mom. In two weeks, Jaime spends $46 on lunch, so in one week, she spends $23 on lunch. Therefore, Jaime saves $50 - $23 = $27 per week. Next, we need to figure out how many weeks it will take Jaime to save $135. We can set up an equation: $27 per week x number of weeks = $135 To solve for the number of weeks, we can divide both sides by $27: number of weeks = $135 / $27 number of weeks = 5 Therefore, it will take Jaime 5 weeks to save $135. The answer is 135.\n\n\nQ: Michael has $42. Michael gives away half the money to his brother. His brother then buys 3 dollars worth of candy. If his brother has $35 left, how much money, in dollars, did his brother have at first?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Michael had $42. Next, he gave away half of that money to his brother, which is $21. His brother then spent $3 on candy, leaving him with $35. To figure out how much money his brother had at first, we need to work backwards. If his brother had $35 after spending $3 on candy, then he had $38 before buying the candy. And if his brother received $21 from Michael, then he must have had $17 to begin with. Therefore, his brother had $17 at first. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Grant spends $200.00 a year to have the newspaper delivered daily to his house.  Juanita buys the newspaper daily.  Monday through Saturday, she spends $0.50 and on Sunday she spends $2.00.  How much more money does Juanita spend buying the newspaper yearly than Grant?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper daily from Monday to Saturday: $0.50 x 6 = $3.00 Now, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper on Sundays: $2.00 x 1 = $2.00 Next, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper weekly: $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00 Finally, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper yearly: $5.00 x 52 = $260.00 Now, let's calculate the difference between what Juanita spends and what Grant spends: $260.00 - $200.00 = $60.00 Therefore, Juanita spends $60.00 more buying the newspaper yearly than Grant. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Logan makes $65,000 a year. He spends $20,000 on rent every year, $5000 on groceries every year, and $8000 on gas every year. If he wants to have at least $42000 left, how much more money must he make each year?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how much Logan spends in total each year: $20,000 (rent) + $5,000 (groceries) + $8,000 (gas) = $33,000 Next, we need to subtract that amount from his annual income: $65,000 (income) - $33,000 (expenses) = $32,000 So Logan currently has $32,000 left after paying his expenses. However, he wants to have at least $42,000 left. Therefore, we need to calculate how much more money he needs to make each year: $42,000 (desired savings) - $32,000 (current savings) = $10,000 Therefore, Logan needs to make at least $10,000 more each year to reach his desired savings goal. The answer is 10000.\n\n\n"
