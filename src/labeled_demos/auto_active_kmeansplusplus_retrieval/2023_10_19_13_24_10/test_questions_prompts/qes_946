  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Betsy is sewing a quilt.  The quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side.  Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together.  How many more squares does she need to sew together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many squares Betsy has already sewn together. If the quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side, then the total number of squares in the quilt is: 16 x 16 = 256 squares If Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together, then she has sewn: 0.25 x 256 = 64 squares Now we need to find out how many more squares she needs to sew together. To do this, we can subtract the number of squares she has already sewn from the total number of squares in the quilt: 256 - 64 = 192 squares So Betsy still needs to sew together 192 squares to complete the quilt. The answer is 192.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: Ron is part of a book club that allows each member to take a turn picking a new book every week. The club is made up of three couples and five single people along with Ron and his wife. How many times a year does Ron get to pick a new book?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of people in the book club. There are three couples, which means six people. There are also five single people. Adding Ron and his wife, we get: 6 (couples) + 5 (singles) + 2 (Ron and his wife) = 13 people in the book club Since each member gets to pick a new book every week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, we can calculate the number of times Ron gets to pick a new book: Ron gets to pick a new book once every 13 weeks (since there are 13 people in the club) 52 weeks in a year \u00f7 13 weeks per pick = 4 times a year Therefore, Ron gets to pick a new book 4 times a year. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Janet has 24 dresses.  Half of them have pockets.  Of those, a third have 2 pockets and the rest have 3 pockets.  How many total pockets do her dresses have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many dresses have pockets. We know that half of the dresses have pockets, so: 24 / 2 = 12 dresses have pockets Next, we need to find out how many of those 12 dresses have 2 pockets. We know that a third of the dresses with pockets have 2 pockets, so: 12 / 3 = 4 dresses have 2 pockets That means the remaining dresses with pockets (12 - 4 = 8) have 3 pockets each. Now we can calculate the total number of pockets: 4 dresses with 2 pockets = 4 x 2 = 8 pockets 8 dresses with 3 pockets = 8 x 3 = 24 pockets So the total number of pockets is: 8 + 24 = 32 pockets Therefore, Janet's dresses have a total of 32 pockets. The answer is 32.\n\n\nQ: James writes a comic every other day for 4 years. If there was no leap year, how many comics has he written?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days there are in 4 years. Since there are 365 days in a year, we can multiply 365 by 4 to get: 365 x 4 = 1460 days Next, we need to figure out how many comics James writes in every other day. Since he writes a comic every other day, we can divide the total number of days by 2 to get: 1460 / 2 = 730 comics Therefore, James has written 730 comics in 4 years if there was no leap year. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Johnny is buying planks of wood to build some tables. Each table needs a plank of wood for each of the legs and 5 planks of wood for the surface. If Johnny wants to build 5 tables, how many planks of wood does he need?\nA: Let's think step by step. Each table needs 4 planks of wood for the legs (assuming it's a standard table with 4 legs). So for 5 tables, Johnny needs 5 x 4 = 20 planks of wood for the legs. Each table also needs 5 planks of wood for the surface, so for 5 tables, Johnny needs 5 x 5 = 25 planks of wood for the surfaces. Therefore, Johnny needs a total of 20 + 25 = 45 planks of wood to build 5 tables. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. If Mabel has 85 marbles, how many more marbles does Mabel have than Amanda?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Katrina has. We know that Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 85 marbles, so we can set up an equation: Mabel's marbles = 5 x Katrina's marbles 85 = 5 x Katrina's marbles Katrina's marbles = 17 Now we know that Katrina has 17 marbles. We also know that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. So we can set up another equation: Amanda's marbles = 2 x Katrina's marbles + 12 Amanda's marbles = 2 x 17 + 12 Amanda's marbles = 46 So Amanda has 46 marbles. Finally, we can figure out how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda: Mabel's marbles - Amanda's marbles = 85 - 46 Mabel's marbles - Amanda's marbles = 39 Therefore, Mabel has 39 more marbles than Amanda. The answer is 39.\n\n\n"
