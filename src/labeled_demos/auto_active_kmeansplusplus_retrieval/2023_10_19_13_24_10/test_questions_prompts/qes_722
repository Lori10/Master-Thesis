  "test_question": "Q: The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. If the 3 ropes had a combined length of 37 centimeters, what was the length of the red rope in centimeters?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A 1165 cm long rope is cut into 154 pieces. 150 of the pieces are equally sized and the remaining pieces are 100mm each. Find the length of each of the equal pieces in millimeters.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total length of the 100mm pieces. There are 154 pieces in total, and 150 of them are equal in size. So, the remaining 4 pieces must be the 100mm pieces. 4 pieces x 100mm/piece = 400mm Now, we can subtract the length of the 100mm pieces from the total length of the rope: 1165cm - 40cm = 1125cm We know that the 150 equal pieces are the same size, so we can divide the remaining length by 150 to find the length of each piece: 1125cm \u00f7 150 pieces = 7.5cm/piece Finally, we need to convert centimeters to millimeters: 7.5cm/piece x 10mm/cm = 75mm/piece Therefore, each of the equal pieces is 75 millimeters long. The answer is 75.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: There are four growing trees. The first tree grows 1 meter/day, the second grows the same amount in half the time, the third grows 2 meters/day, and the fourth tree grows a meter more than the third each day. How many meters did the trees grow in total in 4 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much the second tree grows per day. Since it grows the same amount as the first tree in half the time, it grows 2 meters/day. Now we can calculate how much each tree grows in 4 days: - The first tree grows 1 meter/day, so in 4 days it grows 4 meters. - The second tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The third tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The fourth tree grows 1 meter more than the third each day, so it grows 3 meters/day. In 4 days it grows 12 meters. Adding up the growth of all four trees, we get: 4 + 8 + 8 + 12 = 32 meters Therefore, the trees grew a total of 32 meters in 4 days. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Cleo and Ignacio placed 30 of their marbles in a jar on a Monday. They took 3/5 of the marbles from the jar the next day and divided them equally. On the third day, Cleo took 1/2 of the marbles remaining in the jars. How many marbles did Cleo have on the third day?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many marbles were taken from the jar on the second day. 3/5 of 30 marbles = (3/5) x 30 = 18 marbles So, 18 marbles were taken from the jar on the second day. Step 2: Find out how many marbles were left in the jar after the second day. 30 - 18 = 12 marbles So, 12 marbles were left in the jar after the second day. Step 3: Find out how many marbles Cleo took on the third day. 1/2 of 12 marbles = (1/2) x 12 = 6 marbles So, Cleo took 6 marbles on the third day. Step 4: Find out how many marbles Cleo had on the third day. Cleo had 6 marbles on the third day. Therefore, Cleo had 6 marbles on the third day. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: If a circle has a radius of 14 feet, how many 6-inch pencils can be placed end-to-end across the diameter of the circle?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the diameter of the circle. The diameter is twice the radius, so: Diameter = 2 x Radius Diameter = 2 x 14 feet Diameter = 28 feet Next, we need to convert the length of the pencils from inches to feet, since the diameter is in feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so: Length of pencil in feet = 6 inches / 12 inches per foot Length of pencil in feet = 0.5 feet Now we can find how many pencils can be placed end-to-end across the diameter of the circle. We simply divide the diameter by the length of one pencil: Number of pencils = Diameter / Length of one pencil Number of pencils = 28 feet / 0.5 feet Number of pencils = 56 pencils Therefore, 56 6-inch pencils can be placed end-to-end across the diameter of the circle. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Nori had 4 boxes of crayons with 8 crayons in each box. She gave 5 crayons to Mae and also give some crayons to Lea. How many more crayons did she give to Lea than Mae if she has only 15 crayons left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many crayons Nori had in total. 4 boxes x 8 crayons per box = 32 crayons Next, we need to subtract the 5 crayons Nori gave to Mae. 32 crayons - 5 crayons = 27 crayons We know that Nori has 15 crayons left, so we can subtract that from the 27 crayons to find out how many crayons she gave to Lea. 27 crayons - 15 crayons = 12 crayons Therefore, Nori gave 12 crayons to Lea. To find out how many more crayons Nori gave to Lea than Mae, we can subtract the 5 crayons from Mae from the 12 crayons given to Lea. 12 crayons - 5 crayons = 7 crayons So Nori gave 7 more crayons to Lea than Mae. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Blanche, Rose and Dorothy liked to collect sea glass when they went to the beach.  Blanche found 12 pieces of green and 3 pieces of red sea glass.  Rose found 9 pieces of red and 11 pieces of blue sea glass.  If Dorothy found twice as many pieces of red glass as Blanche and Rose and three times as much blue sea glass as Rose, how many pieces did Dorothy have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many pieces of red sea glass Blanche and Rose found combined. Blanche found 3 pieces of red sea glass and Rose found 9 pieces of red sea glass, so together they found 3 + 9 = 12 pieces of red sea glass. Next, let's find out how many pieces of blue sea glass Rose found. Rose found 11 pieces of blue sea glass. Now, let's use the information given to find out how many pieces of red and blue sea glass Dorothy found. We know that Dorothy found twice as many pieces of red sea glass as Blanche and Rose combined, which is 2 * 12 = 24 pieces of red sea glass. We also know that Dorothy found three times as much blue sea glass as Rose, which is 3 * 11 = 33 pieces of blue sea glass. Finally, we can add up all the pieces of sea glass that Dorothy found: 24 pieces of red sea glass + 33 pieces of blue sea glass = 57 pieces of sea glass in total. Therefore, Dorothy found 57 pieces of sea glass. The answer is 57.\n\n\nQ: Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. If Mabel has 85 marbles, how many more marbles does Mabel have than Amanda?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Katrina has. We know that Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 85 marbles, so we can set up an equation: Mabel's marbles = 5 x Katrina's marbles 85 = 5 x Katrina's marbles Katrina's marbles = 17 Now we know that Katrina has 17 marbles. We also know that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. So we can set up another equation: Amanda's marbles = 2 x Katrina's marbles + 12 Amanda's marbles = 2 x 17 + 12 Amanda's marbles = 46 So Amanda has 46 marbles. Finally, we can figure out how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda: Mabel's marbles - Amanda's marbles = 85 - 46 Mabel's marbles - Amanda's marbles = 39 Therefore, Mabel has 39 more marbles than Amanda. The answer is 39.\n\n\n"
