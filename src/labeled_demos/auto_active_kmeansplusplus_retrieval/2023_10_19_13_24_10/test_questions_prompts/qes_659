  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Phoebe has two pizzas to share with her and three friends. One has pepperoni and the other has cheese. They both have 16 slices. They all eat the same amount. One friend eats only pepperoni, while the rest have an equal number of slices of each. At the end, there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese, how many slices does each person eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 2 pizzas with 16 slices each, so there are a total of 32 slices. Next, we know that one friend only eats pepperoni, so they eat one slice from the pepperoni pizza. That leaves 31 slices, with 15 slices from each pizza. We also know that there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese left. So, the remaining 15 slices are divided equally among the remaining 3 friends, which means each of them eats 5 slices. Therefore, each person eats 1 slice of pepperoni and 5 slices of cheese. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Phill cuts the pizza in half, which gives him 2 slices. Then he cuts both halves in half, which gives him 4 slices. And then he cuts each slice in half again, which gives him 8 slices in total. Next, Phill passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends, which means he gives away 3 slices in total. He also passes out 2 slices to 2 of his friends, which means he gives away 4 slices in total. Therefore, Phill has given away a total of 7 slices of pizza. If he started with 8 slices, then he has 1 slice left for himself. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Bertha started with two balls and gave one to her partner, so she has one ball left. Next, we need to figure out how many balls she loses and how many wear out. In 20 games, she loses 20/5 = 4 balls and 20/10 = 2 balls wear out. Finally, we need to figure out how many balls she buys. In 20 games, she buys 20/4 = 5 canisters of three balls, which is a total of 5*3 = 15 balls. So, in total, Bertha has 1 (starting ball) - 4 (lost balls) - 2 (worn out balls) + 15 (bought balls) = 10 tennis balls. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Mary wants 144 cupcakes for her party. Mary has already made 36 cherry cupcakes, and 48 berry cupcakes. Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes for the rest. How much of each should she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Mary has already made: 36 cherry + 48 berry = 84 cupcakes Next, we need to figure out how many more cupcakes Mary needs to make: 144 total cupcakes - 84 cupcakes already made = 60 cupcakes Since Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, we can divide the remaining 60 cupcakes by 2: 60 cupcakes \u00f7 2 = 30 cupcakes of each flavor Therefore, Mary should make 30 chocolate cupcakes and 30 vanilla cupcakes to have a total of 144 cupcakes for her party. The answer is 144.\n\n\nQ: Alex was having a cookout Friday night and planned to serve burgers to his guests.  He planned to cook 3 burgers for each guest and had invited 10 friends over.  1 of his friends didn't eat meat and said they would bring their own food.  Another one of his friends didn't eat bread and would not need the buns.  The burger buns came 8 to a pack.  How many packs of buns did Alex need to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many guests will be eating burgers. Alex invited 10 friends, but one won't be eating meat, so there will be 9 guests eating burgers. Next, we need to figure out how many burgers Alex will need to cook. He plans to cook 3 burgers for each guest, so he will need to cook 3 x 9 = 27 burgers. Now we need to figure out how many buns Alex will need. Each burger needs 2 buns, but one of his friends won't be eating the buns, so he will only need 2 x 26 = 52 buns. Since the buns come 8 to a pack, we need to divide 52 by 8 to find out how many packs of buns Alex needs to buy. 52 \u00f7 8 = 6.5 Since we can't buy half a pack of buns, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So Alex needs to buy 7 packs of buns. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Betty and Dora started making some cupcakes at the same time. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour and Dora makes 8 every hour. If Betty took a two-hour break, what is the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Betty made in the first 3 hours before taking a break. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour, so in 3 hours, she would make: 10 cupcakes/hour x 3 hours = 30 cupcakes Next, we need to find out how many cupcakes Dora made in the same 5 hours. Dora makes 8 cupcakes every hour, so in 5 hours, she would make: 8 cupcakes/hour x 5 hours = 40 cupcakes Now we need to find the difference between the number of cupcakes they made. Betty made 30 cupcakes before taking a break, and Dora made 40 cupcakes in the same 5 hours. So the difference between the number of cupcakes they made is: 40 cupcakes - 30 cupcakes = 10 cupcakes Therefore, the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours is 10 cupcakes. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Five people are planning a party. Sonja will buy a loaf of French bread ($3 a loaf) and a platter of cold cuts ($23). Barbara will buy the soda ($1 per person) and two boxes of crackers ($2 per box). Mario and Rick will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles ($3 per package). Danica will supply a package of paper plates for $4. How much more will Sonja spend than the rest of the office put together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of Barbara's contribution. She will buy soda for 5 people, which will cost $5 (1 dollar per person). She will also buy two boxes of crackers, which will cost $4 (2 dollars per box). Therefore, Barbara's total contribution will be $9. Next, let's calculate the total cost of Mario and Rick's contribution. They will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles, which will cost $6 in total (3 dollars per package). Now, let's add up the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's. Barbara's contribution is $9, Mario and Rick's contribution is $6, and Danica's contribution is $4. Therefore, the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's is $19. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of Sonja's contribution. She will buy a loaf of French bread for $3 and a platter of cold cuts for $23. Therefore, Sonja's total contribution will be $26. To find out how much more Sonja will spend than the rest of the office put together, we need to subtract the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's from Sonja's total contribution. $26 (Sonja's contribution) - $19 (total cost of everyone else's contribution) = $7 Therefore, Sonja will spend $7 more than the rest of the office put together. The answer is 7.\n\n\n"
