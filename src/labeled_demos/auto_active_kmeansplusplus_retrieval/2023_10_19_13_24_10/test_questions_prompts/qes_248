If there are 10 students on campus at the beginning of the year, how many additional students would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In a school, the number of participants in the 2018 Science Quiz Bowl was 150. There were 20 more than twice the number of participants in 2019 as there were in 2018. In 2020, the number of participants was 40 less than half the number of participants in 2019. How many more participants were there in 2019 than in 2020?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many participants there were in 2019. We know that there were 20 more than twice the number of participants in 2018, so we can set up an equation: 2019 participants = 20 + 2 * 2018 participants 2019 participants = 20 + 2 * 150 2019 participants = 320 Next, we need to find out how many participants there were in 2020. We know that the number of participants in 2020 was 40 less than half the number of participants in 2019, so we can set up another equation: 2020 participants = 0.5 * 2019 participants - 40 2020 participants = 0.5 * 320 - 40 2020 participants = 80 Finally, we can find out how many more participants there were in 2019 than in 2020: 2019 participants - 2020 participants = 320 - 80 = 240 Therefore, there were 240 more participants in 2019 than in 2020. The answer is 2020.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many students are in Alice's class. We know that there are 40 students and 10 instructors, so the total number of people in the class is 40 + 10 = 50. Next, we need to figure out how many students are bringing their own life vests. We know that 20% of the students are bringing life vests, so we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of students by 0.2: 40 x 0.2 = 8. So 8 students are bringing their own life vests. Now we need to figure out how many life vests we still need. We have 20 life vests on hand, and we need one for each of the 50 people in the class. So we need 50 - 20 = 30 more life vests. However, we already know that 8 students are bringing their own life vests, so we can subtract those from the total number we need: 30 - 8 = 22. Therefore, Alice needs to get 22 more life vests so that the entire class has one. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Tracy has been collecting novels from her friends to donate to the Children For The Future charity organization. In the first week she collects a certain number of books. In the next five weeks, she collects ten times as many books as she did in the first week. How many books did she collect in the first week if she has 99 books now?\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that Tracy collected x number of books in the first week. According to the problem, in the next five weeks, she collected ten times as many books as she did in the first week. So, in the next five weeks, she collected 10x books. Therefore, the total number of books she collected is x + 10x = 11x. We also know that she has 99 books now. So, we can set up an equation: 11x = 99 To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 11: x = 9 Therefore, Tracy collected 9 books in the first week. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Ron is part of a book club that allows each member to take a turn picking a new book every week. The club is made up of three couples and five single people along with Ron and his wife. How many times a year does Ron get to pick a new book?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of people in the book club. There are three couples, which means six people. There are also five single people. Adding Ron and his wife, we get: 6 (couples) + 5 (singles) + 2 (Ron and his wife) = 13 people in the book club Since each member gets to pick a new book every week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, we can calculate the number of times Ron gets to pick a new book: Ron gets to pick a new book once every 13 weeks (since there are 13 people in the club) 52 weeks in a year \u00f7 13 weeks per pick = 4 times a year Therefore, Ron gets to pick a new book 4 times a year. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: There are four growing trees. The first tree grows 1 meter/day, the second grows the same amount in half the time, the third grows 2 meters/day, and the fourth tree grows a meter more than the third each day. How many meters did the trees grow in total in 4 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much the second tree grows per day. Since it grows the same amount as the first tree in half the time, it grows 2 meters/day. Now we can calculate how much each tree grows in 4 days: - The first tree grows 1 meter/day, so in 4 days it grows 4 meters. - The second tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The third tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The fourth tree grows 1 meter more than the third each day, so it grows 3 meters/day. In 4 days it grows 12 meters. Adding up the growth of all four trees, we get: 4 + 8 + 8 + 12 = 32 meters Therefore, the trees grew a total of 32 meters in 4 days. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Dani brings two and half dozen cupcakes for her 2nd-grade class.  There are 27 students (including Dani), 1 teacher, and 1 teacher\u2019s aid.  If 3 students called in sick that day, how many cupcakes are left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Dani brought in total. Two and a half dozen cupcakes is equal to 30 cupcakes (since a dozen is 12). Next, we need to figure out how many people will be receiving cupcakes. There are 27 students, 1 teacher, and 1 teacher's aid, for a total of 29 people. However, 3 students called in sick, so we need to subtract them from the total. 29 - 3 = 26 people receiving cupcakes. Now, we need to subtract 26 cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes Dani brought. 30 - 26 = 4 cupcakes left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Nine hundred tickets were sold to a concert. Three-fourths of those who bought the ticket came before the start of the concert. Five-ninths of the remaining came few minutes after the first song. Eighty people arrived during the middle part of the concert while the rest did not go. How many of those who bought the tickets did not go?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many people came before the start of the concert. Three-fourths of 900 tickets = (3/4) x 900 = 675 people came before the start of the concert. Step 2: Find out how many people were left after the first group came. 900 - 675 = 225 people were left. Step 3: Find out how many people came few minutes after the first song. Five-ninths of the remaining 225 people = (5/9) x 225 = 125 people came few minutes after the first song. Step 4: Find out how many people were left after the second group came. 225 - 125 = 100 people were left. Step 5: Subtract the number of people who arrived during the middle part of the concert from the number of people left. 100 - 80 = 20 people did not go to the concert. Therefore, 20 people who bought the tickets did not go to the concert. The answer is 20.\n\n\n"
