  "test_question": "Q: Pamela reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside.  Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles.  While on vacation, if she will be outside 4 hours a day over 8 days, how many bottles of sunscreen will she need to pack?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Tim drinks 2 bottles that are each 1.5 quarts and an additional 20 ounces a day.  How much water does he drink a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the 1.5 quarts to ounces. 1 quart = 32 ounces So, 1.5 quarts = 1.5 x 32 = 48 ounces Tim drinks 2 bottles, so he drinks 2 x 48 = 96 ounces from the bottles. He also drinks an additional 20 ounces a day, so he drinks a total of 96 + 20 = 116 ounces a day. To find out how much he drinks in a week, we need to multiply 116 by 7 (the number of days in a week). 116 x 7 = 812 Therefore, Tim drinks 812 ounces of water in a week. The answer is 812.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: A vampire needs to suck 7 gallons of blood per week to survive.  If he sucks 2 pints of blood per person, how many people does he need to suck each day to survive?\nA: Let's think step by step. 1 gallon = 8 pints (since 1 gallon = 128 fluid ounces and 1 fluid ounce = 0.125 pints) So, 7 gallons = 7 x 8 = 56 pints The vampire needs to suck 56 pints of blood per week to survive. 2 pints of blood per person To find out how many people the vampire needs to suck each day, we need to divide 56 by the number of days in a week (7). 56/7 = 8 Therefore, the vampire needs to suck blood from 8 people each day to survive. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: John takes a 10-minute shower every other day for 4 weeks. If his shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute.  How much water does he use in those 4 weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many showers John takes in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks is 4 x 7 = 28 days. Since John takes a shower every other day, he takes 28/2 = 14 showers in 4 weeks. Next, we need to find out how much water he uses per shower. John takes a 10-minute shower, and his shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute. So, he uses 10 x 2 = 20 gallons of water per shower. Finally, we can find out how much water he uses in 4 weeks by multiplying the amount of water per shower by the number of showers he takes: 20 gallons per shower x 14 showers = 280 gallons of water in 4 weeks. Therefore, John uses 280 gallons of water in those 4 weeks. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: The toothpaste in Anne's family's bathroom contains 105 grams. Anne's dad uses 3 grams at each brushing, her mom uses 2 grams, Anne and her brother use 1 gram each. Each member of the family brushes their teeth three times a day. How many days will it take for the toothpaste to run out?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many grams of toothpaste are used per day by the family. Anne's dad uses 3 grams x 3 brushings = 9 grams per day. Anne's mom uses 2 grams x 3 brushings = 6 grams per day. Anne and her brother use 1 gram x 2 people x 3 brushings = 6 grams per day. Total toothpaste used per day = 9 + 6 + 6 = 21 grams. Now, let's divide the total amount of toothpaste by the amount used per day to find out how many days it will last. 105 grams \u00f7 21 grams per day = 5 days. Therefore, the toothpaste will last for 5 days. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Timmy, Tommy and Tina are filling up a kiddie pool in their backyard.  Each has a pail they fill with water from a house before dumping it into the pool.  If Timmy's pail holds twice as much water as Tommy's, and Tommy's holds 2 gallons more than Tina's, and Tina's is 4 gallons, how much water do the three of them fill the pool with after 3 trips each?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much water each pail can hold. We know that Tina's pail holds 4 gallons. Tommy's pail holds 2 more gallons than Tina's, so it holds 4 + 2 = 6 gallons. Timmy's pail holds twice as much as Tommy's, so it holds 6 x 2 = 12 gallons. Now we know how much water each pail can hold, we can figure out how much water they can fill the pool with after 1 trip each. Together, they can fill the pool with 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 gallons of water. After 3 trips each, they will have filled the pool with 22 x 3 = 66 gallons of water. The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: Jessica just got her driving permit. She must complete 50 hours of driving with a parent to get her driver\u2019s license. It takes 20 minutes to drive to school. If she drives to and from school every day, how many school days will it take Jessica to meet the 50-hour driving requirement?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much time Jessica spends driving to and from school each day. She drives to school and back, so that's a total of 2 trips. Each trip takes 20 minutes, so she spends 40 minutes driving to and from school each day. Next, we need to figure out how many minutes of driving Jessica needs to complete in order to reach the 50-hour requirement. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 50 hours is equal to 50 x 60 = 3000 minutes. Now we can divide the total minutes of driving required by the number of minutes Jessica spends driving each day: 3000 / 40 = 75. So Jessica needs to drive for 75 school days in order to complete the 50-hour driving requirement. The answer is 50.\n\n\nQ: To get to an island called \"Virgo\", Tom needs to travel by plane and then by boat. The plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, and the boat trip takes up to 2 hours. In how many hours is Tom able to get to the \"Virgo\" island?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long the plane trip is. We know that the plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, so we can set up an equation: plane trip = 4 * boat trip Since we know the boat trip takes 2 hours, we can substitute that in: plane trip = 4 * 2 plane trip = 8 So the plane trip is 8 hours. Now we just need to add the plane trip and the boat trip together to find the total time: total time = plane trip + boat trip total time = 8 + 2 total time = 10 So Tom is able to get to the \"Virgo\" island in 10 hours. The answer is 10.\n\n\n"
