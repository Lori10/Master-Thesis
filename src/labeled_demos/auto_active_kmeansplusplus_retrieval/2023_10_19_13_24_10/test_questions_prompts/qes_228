  "test_question": "Q: Mary has 30 sheep. She gets 1 kg of milk from half of them and 2 kg of milk from the other half every day. How much milk does she collect every day?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Cleo and Ignacio placed 30 of their marbles in a jar on a Monday. They took 3/5 of the marbles from the jar the next day and divided them equally. On the third day, Cleo took 1/2 of the marbles remaining in the jars. How many marbles did Cleo have on the third day?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many marbles were taken from the jar on the second day. 3/5 of 30 marbles = (3/5) x 30 = 18 marbles So, 18 marbles were taken from the jar on the second day. Step 2: Find out how many marbles were left in the jar after the second day. 30 - 18 = 12 marbles So, 12 marbles were left in the jar after the second day. Step 3: Find out how many marbles Cleo took on the third day. 1/2 of 12 marbles = (1/2) x 12 = 6 marbles So, Cleo took 6 marbles on the third day. Step 4: Find out how many marbles Cleo had on the third day. Cleo had 6 marbles on the third day. Therefore, Cleo had 6 marbles on the third day. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of 18 watermelons. Since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, the total weight of 18 watermelons would be: 23 x 18 = 414 pounds Next, we need to find the total amount of money Farmer Kent would make by selling these watermelons. Since he sells them for $2 a pound, we can multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 414 x $2 = $828 Therefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Miriam currently has 30 marbles, but she used to have more. Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, gave her sister twice that amount and gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has. How many marbles did Miriam start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, so she now has 30 - 60 = -30 marbles. This doesn't make sense, so we know that Miriam must have started with more than 60 marbles. Next, we know that Miriam gave her sister twice the amount she gave her brother, so her sister received 2 * 60 = 120 marbles. We also know that Miriam gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has, so Savanna received 3 * 30 = 90 marbles. In total, Miriam gave away 60 + 120 + 90 = 270 marbles. If Miriam started with x marbles, we can set up the equation: x - 270 = 30 Solving for x, we get: x = 300 Therefore, Miriam started with 300 marbles. The answer is 300.\n\n\nQ: Mary wants 144 cupcakes for her party. Mary has already made 36 cherry cupcakes, and 48 berry cupcakes. Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes for the rest. How much of each should she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Mary has already made: 36 cherry + 48 berry = 84 cupcakes Next, we need to figure out how many more cupcakes Mary needs to make: 144 total cupcakes - 84 cupcakes already made = 60 cupcakes Since Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, we can divide the remaining 60 cupcakes by 2: 60 cupcakes \u00f7 2 = 30 cupcakes of each flavor Therefore, Mary should make 30 chocolate cupcakes and 30 vanilla cupcakes to have a total of 144 cupcakes for her party. The answer is 144.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: Betty and Dora started making some cupcakes at the same time. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour and Dora makes 8 every hour. If Betty took a two-hour break, what is the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Betty made in the first 3 hours before taking a break. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour, so in 3 hours, she would make: 10 cupcakes/hour x 3 hours = 30 cupcakes Next, we need to find out how many cupcakes Dora made in the same 5 hours. Dora makes 8 cupcakes every hour, so in 5 hours, she would make: 8 cupcakes/hour x 5 hours = 40 cupcakes Now we need to find the difference between the number of cupcakes they made. Betty made 30 cupcakes before taking a break, and Dora made 40 cupcakes in the same 5 hours. So the difference between the number of cupcakes they made is: 40 cupcakes - 30 cupcakes = 10 cupcakes Therefore, the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours is 10 cupcakes. The answer is 10.\n\n\n"
