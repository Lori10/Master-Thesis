  "test_question": "Q: Melissa works as a pet groomer. This week, she has 8 dogs that need to be bathed, 5 cats that need their nails clipped, 3 birds that need their wings trimmed, and 12 horses that need to be brushed. If she splits the grooming jobs evenly over the days, how many animals will she groom each day of the week?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: Jeff has a shelter where he currently takes care of 20 cats. On Monday he found 2 kittens in a box and took them to the shelter. On Tuesday he found 1 more cat with a leg injury. On Wednesday 3 people adopted 2 cats each. How many cats does Jeff currently have in his shelter?\nA: Let's think step by step. Jeff had 20 cats in his shelter. On Monday he found 2 kittens and took them to the shelter, so he now has 20 + 2 = 22 cats. On Tuesday he found 1 more cat with a leg injury, so he now has 22 + 1 = 23 cats. On Wednesday, 3 people adopted 2 cats each, which means a total of 3 x 2 = 6 cats were adopted. Therefore, Jeff currently has 23 - 6 = 17 cats in his shelter. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: John adopts a dog from a shelter.  The dog ends up having health problems and this requires 3 vet appointments,  which cost $400 each.  After the first appointment, John paid $100 for pet insurance that covers 80% of the subsequent visits.  How much did he pay in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, John paid $400 for the first vet appointment. Then, he paid $100 for pet insurance that covers 80% of the subsequent visits. This means that for the next two vet appointments, he will only have to pay 20% of the cost. So for the second and third vet appointments, John will pay: 20% of $400 = $80 Therefore, the total cost for the three vet appointments will be: $400 (first appointment) + $80 (second appointment) + $80 (third appointment) = $560 So John paid a total of $560 for the three vet appointments. The answer is 560.\n\n\nQ: At the zoo, there are 5 different types of animals. Seeing each animal type takes around 6 minutes. How much time would it take to see each animal type if the zoo decided to import 4 new species?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many animal types there will be in total after the zoo imports 4 new species. 5 (original animal types) + 4 (new species) = 9 (total animal types) Next, we need to find out how long it takes to see each animal type. 6 minutes per animal type x 9 animal types = 54 minutes Therefore, it would take 54 minutes to see each animal type if the zoo decided to import 4 new species. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Joy fosters dogs.  The mom foster dog eats 1.5 cups of food, three times a day.  The puppies each eat 1/2 cup of food, twice a day.  There are 5 puppies.  How much food will Joy need for the next 6 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much food the mom foster dog eats in one day: 1.5 cups x 3 = 4.5 cups/day Next, let's calculate how much food one puppy eats in one day: 0.5 cups x 2 = 1 cup/day Since there are 5 puppies, they eat a total of: 5 x 1 = 5 cups/day To calculate how much food Joy needs for 6 days, we need to multiply the daily amount of food by 6: Mom foster dog: 4.5 cups/day x 6 days = 27 cups Puppies: 5 cups/day x 6 days = 30 cups Therefore, Joy will need a total of 27 + 30 = 57 cups of food for the next 6 days. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: John takes a 10-minute shower every other day for 4 weeks. If his shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute.  How much water does he use in those 4 weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many showers John takes in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks is 4 x 7 = 28 days. Since John takes a shower every other day, he takes 28/2 = 14 showers in 4 weeks. Next, we need to find out how much water he uses per shower. John takes a 10-minute shower, and his shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute. So, he uses 10 x 2 = 20 gallons of water per shower. Finally, we can find out how much water he uses in 4 weeks by multiplying the amount of water per shower by the number of showers he takes: 20 gallons per shower x 14 showers = 280 gallons of water in 4 weeks. Therefore, John uses 280 gallons of water in those 4 weeks. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Janet buys 45-pound containers of cat litter for $21 each.  If her cat litter box holds 15 pounds of cat litter, and she changes out the litter weekly, how much will it cost, in dollars, for her to buy enough litter to last 210 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much cat litter Janet needs for 210 days. Since she changes the litter weekly, we need to multiply the amount of litter she uses in a week by the number of weeks in 210 days. Number of weeks in 210 days = 210/7 = 30 weeks Amount of litter used in a week = 15 pounds Amount of litter needed for 210 days = 15 pounds/week x 30 weeks = 450 pounds Next, we need to figure out how many 45-pound containers of cat litter Janet needs to buy to get 450 pounds of litter. Number of 45-pound containers needed = 450 pounds/45 pounds/container = 10 containers Finally, we can calculate the total cost of the cat litter. Cost of one 45-pound container = $21 Total cost of 10 containers = $21/container x 10 containers = $210 Therefore, it will cost Janet $210 to buy enough cat litter to last 210 days. The answer is 210.\n\n\n"
