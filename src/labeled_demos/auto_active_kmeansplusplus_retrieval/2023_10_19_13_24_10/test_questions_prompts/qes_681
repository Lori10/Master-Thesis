  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Five people are planning a party. Sonja will buy a loaf of French bread ($3 a loaf) and a platter of cold cuts ($23). Barbara will buy the soda ($1 per person) and two boxes of crackers ($2 per box). Mario and Rick will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles ($3 per package). Danica will supply a package of paper plates for $4. How much more will Sonja spend than the rest of the office put together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of Barbara's contribution. She will buy soda for 5 people, which will cost $5 (1 dollar per person). She will also buy two boxes of crackers, which will cost $4 (2 dollars per box). Therefore, Barbara's total contribution will be $9. Next, let's calculate the total cost of Mario and Rick's contribution. They will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles, which will cost $6 in total (3 dollars per package). Now, let's add up the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's. Barbara's contribution is $9, Mario and Rick's contribution is $6, and Danica's contribution is $4. Therefore, the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's is $19. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of Sonja's contribution. She will buy a loaf of French bread for $3 and a platter of cold cuts for $23. Therefore, Sonja's total contribution will be $26. To find out how much more Sonja will spend than the rest of the office put together, we need to subtract the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's from Sonja's total contribution. $26 (Sonja's contribution) - $19 (total cost of everyone else's contribution) = $7 Therefore, Sonja will spend $7 more than the rest of the office put together. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: A gallon of whole milk that normally costs $3 is now sold at $2. A box of cereal was sold at a discount of $1. How much will you save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the discount for each gallon of whole milk. The discount is $3 - $2 = $1 per gallon. So, if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk, you will save 3 x $1 = $3. Next, let's calculate the discount for each box of cereal. The discount is $1 per box. So, if you buy 5 boxes of cereal, you will save 5 x $1 = $5. Therefore, the total amount you will save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal is $3 + $5 = $8. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Martha needs 4 cups of berries and 2 cups of heavy cream to make 1 quart of ice cream.  She wants to make 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream.  At the farmers market, the 2 cup packages of strawberries are $3.00 each and the 2 cup package of raspberries are $5.00 each.  The heavy cream is sold for $4.00 for a 4 cup container.  How much will it cost her to make 1 quart of each ice cream?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how many packages of strawberries and raspberries Martha needs to make 1 quart of each ice cream. Since she needs 4 cups of berries for 1 quart of ice cream, and each package contains 2 cups, she will need 2 packages of strawberries and 2 packages of raspberries for both quarts of ice cream. The cost of the strawberries will be 2 packages x $3.00 per package = $6.00 for 1 quart of strawberry ice cream. The cost of the raspberries will be 2 packages x $5.00 per package = $10.00 for 1 quart of raspberry ice cream. Next, we need to calculate the cost of the heavy cream. Martha needs 2 cups of heavy cream for 1 quart of ice cream, so she will need 4 cups of heavy cream for both quarts of ice cream. The cost of the heavy cream is $4.00 for a 4 cup container, so it will cost $4.00 for both quarts of ice cream. Therefore, the total cost of making 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream is: $6.00 (strawberries) + $10.00 (raspberries) + $4.00 (heavy cream) = $20.00 The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Mary wants 144 cupcakes for her party. Mary has already made 36 cherry cupcakes, and 48 berry cupcakes. Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes for the rest. How much of each should she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Mary has already made: 36 cherry + 48 berry = 84 cupcakes Next, we need to figure out how many more cupcakes Mary needs to make: 144 total cupcakes - 84 cupcakes already made = 60 cupcakes Since Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, we can divide the remaining 60 cupcakes by 2: 60 cupcakes \u00f7 2 = 30 cupcakes of each flavor Therefore, Mary should make 30 chocolate cupcakes and 30 vanilla cupcakes to have a total of 144 cupcakes for her party. The answer is 144.\n\n\nQ: Alex was having a cookout Friday night and planned to serve burgers to his guests.  He planned to cook 3 burgers for each guest and had invited 10 friends over.  1 of his friends didn't eat meat and said they would bring their own food.  Another one of his friends didn't eat bread and would not need the buns.  The burger buns came 8 to a pack.  How many packs of buns did Alex need to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many guests will be eating burgers. Alex invited 10 friends, but one won't be eating meat, so there will be 9 guests eating burgers. Next, we need to figure out how many burgers Alex will need to cook. He plans to cook 3 burgers for each guest, so he will need to cook 3 x 9 = 27 burgers. Now we need to figure out how many buns Alex will need. Each burger needs 2 buns, but one of his friends won't be eating the buns, so he will only need 2 x 26 = 52 buns. Since the buns come 8 to a pack, we need to divide 52 by 8 to find out how many packs of buns Alex needs to buy. 52 \u00f7 8 = 6.5 Since we can't buy half a pack of buns, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So Alex needs to buy 7 packs of buns. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Dani brings two and half dozen cupcakes for her 2nd-grade class.  There are 27 students (including Dani), 1 teacher, and 1 teacher\u2019s aid.  If 3 students called in sick that day, how many cupcakes are left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Dani brought in total. Two and a half dozen cupcakes is equal to 30 cupcakes (since a dozen is 12). Next, we need to figure out how many people will be receiving cupcakes. There are 27 students, 1 teacher, and 1 teacher's aid, for a total of 29 people. However, 3 students called in sick, so we need to subtract them from the total. 29 - 3 = 26 people receiving cupcakes. Now, we need to subtract 26 cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes Dani brought. 30 - 26 = 4 cupcakes left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: A local restaurant is offering an 8 piece fried chicken bucket and 2 sides for $12.00 that will feed 6 people.  If Monty was having a family reunion for 36 family members, how much will it cost him to buy enough chicken and sides to feed everyone one serving?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many servings of chicken and sides Monty needs to feed 36 people. Since the restaurant's 8 piece fried chicken bucket feeds 6 people, we can calculate that Monty needs 6 buckets of chicken to feed 36 people. Next, we need to figure out how many sides Monty needs. The restaurant offers 2 sides with each 8 piece chicken bucket, so Monty needs 6 x 2 = 12 sides. Now, we can calculate the total cost. Monty is paying $12.00 for 6 people, so he needs to pay 6/6 = 1 dollar per person. To feed 36 people, Monty needs to pay 36 x 1 = $36.00 for the chicken and sides. The answer is 36.\n\n\nQ: Joy fosters dogs.  The mom foster dog eats 1.5 cups of food, three times a day.  The puppies each eat 1/2 cup of food, twice a day.  There are 5 puppies.  How much food will Joy need for the next 6 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much food the mom foster dog eats in one day: 1.5 cups x 3 = 4.5 cups/day Next, let's calculate how much food one puppy eats in one day: 0.5 cups x 2 = 1 cup/day Since there are 5 puppies, they eat a total of: 5 x 1 = 5 cups/day To calculate how much food Joy needs for 6 days, we need to multiply the daily amount of food by 6: Mom foster dog: 4.5 cups/day x 6 days = 27 cups Puppies: 5 cups/day x 6 days = 30 cups Therefore, Joy will need a total of 27 + 30 = 57 cups of food for the next 6 days. The answer is 6.\n\n\n"
