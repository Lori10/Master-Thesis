  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A factory uses robots to manufacture batteries. For each battery that is made, it takes a robot 6 minutes to gather the materials for the battery and 9 minutes to create the battery. If the factory has 10 robots working on batteries at the same time, how many batteries can the robots manufacture in 5 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 5 hours to minutes. 5 hours = 5 x 60 = 300 minutes Next, we need to find out how long it takes for one robot to make one battery. 6 minutes to gather materials + 9 minutes to create battery = 15 minutes per battery Now we can calculate how many batteries one robot can make in 300 minutes. 300 minutes \u00f7 15 minutes per battery = 20 batteries Finally, we can multiply the number of batteries one robot can make by the number of robots working. 20 batteries per robot x 10 robots = 200 batteries Therefore, the robots can manufacture 200 batteries in 5 hours. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Noah\u2019s bedroom light uses 6 watts per hour. His office light is much brighter so he can see to work and uses three times as much energy. The living room light has a much larger space to cover and has to be more powerful, so it uses four times as much energy as his bedroom light. If Noah leaves all those lights on for two hours, how many watts has he used?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many watts Noah's office light uses per hour. We know that it uses three times as much energy as his bedroom light, which is 6 watts per hour. So, the office light uses 3 x 6 = 18 watts per hour. Next, we need to find out how many watts the living room light uses per hour. We know that it uses four times as much energy as his bedroom light, which is 6 watts per hour. So, the living room light uses 4 x 6 = 24 watts per hour. Now that we know the wattage per hour for each light, we can calculate the total watts used by multiplying the wattage per hour by the number of hours the lights were on. In this case, the lights were on for two hours, so: - Noah's bedroom light used 6 watts per hour x 2 hours = 12 watts - Noah's office light used 18 watts per hour x 2 hours = 36 watts - The living room light used 24 watts per hour x 2 hours = 48 watts Therefore, the total watts used by all three lights is 12 + 36 + 48 = 96 watts. The answer is 96.\n\n\nQ: To get to an island called \"Virgo\", Tom needs to travel by plane and then by boat. The plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, and the boat trip takes up to 2 hours. In how many hours is Tom able to get to the \"Virgo\" island?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long the plane trip is. We know that the plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, so we can set up an equation: plane trip = 4 * boat trip Since we know the boat trip takes 2 hours, we can substitute that in: plane trip = 4 * 2 plane trip = 8 So the plane trip is 8 hours. Now we just need to add the plane trip and the boat trip together to find the total time: total time = plane trip + boat trip total time = 8 + 2 total time = 10 So Tom is able to get to the \"Virgo\" island in 10 hours. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: At the zoo, there are 5 different types of animals. Seeing each animal type takes around 6 minutes. How much time would it take to see each animal type if the zoo decided to import 4 new species?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many animal types there will be in total after the zoo imports 4 new species. 5 (original animal types) + 4 (new species) = 9 (total animal types) Next, we need to find out how long it takes to see each animal type. 6 minutes per animal type x 9 animal types = 54 minutes Therefore, it would take 54 minutes to see each animal type if the zoo decided to import 4 new species. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Jill spends time every day talking to her boyfriend on the phone.  The first day of the week she spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend.  Each of the following days she spends twice as much time talking on the phone as the day before. After the 5th day her parents take the phone away from her because she was on it too long.  How much time did Jill spend talking to her boyfriend that week?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Jill spends 5 minutes on the phone with her boyfriend. On the second day, she spends twice as much time as the first day, which is 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 minutes. On the third day, she spends twice as much time as the second day, which is 2*10=<<2*10=20>>20 minutes. On the fourth day, she spends twice as much time as the third day, which is 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 minutes. On the fifth day, she spends twice as much time as the fourth day, which is 2*40=<<2*40=80>>80 minutes. Therefore, Jill spends a total of 5+10+20+40+80=<<5+10+20+40+80=155>>155 minutes talking to her boyfriend that week. The answer is 155.\n\n\nQ: A performing magician has a disappearing act where he makes a random member of his audience disappear and reappear. Unfortunately, one-tenth of the time, the audience member never reappears. However, one-fifth of the time, two people reappear instead of only one. If the magician has put on 100 performances of the act this year, how many people have reappeared?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people disappear in total. Since the magician chooses a random member of the audience each time, we can assume that one person disappears per performance. Therefore, 100 people have disappeared in total. Next, we need to find out how many times one person reappears. We know that one-tenth of the time, the person never reappears, so that means nine-tenths of the time, they do reappear. Therefore, 90 people have reappeared once. Finally, we need to find out how many times two people reappear. We know that one-fifth of the time, this happens. Since there were 100 performances in total, this means that 20 times, two people reappeared. Therefore, 40 people have reappeared twice. To find the total number of people who have reappeared, we add the number of people who have reappeared once to the number of people who have reappeared twice: 90 + 40 = 130 Therefore, 130 people have reappeared in total. The answer is 130.\n\n\nQ: James writes a comic every other day for 4 years. If there was no leap year, how many comics has he written?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days there are in 4 years. Since there are 365 days in a year, we can multiply 365 by 4 to get: 365 x 4 = 1460 days Next, we need to figure out how many comics James writes in every other day. Since he writes a comic every other day, we can divide the total number of days by 2 to get: 1460 / 2 = 730 comics Therefore, James has written 730 comics in 4 years if there was no leap year. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Peter and Kristin are to read 20 fantasy novels each in a week. Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin. If Peter reads one book in 18 hours, how long will Kristin read half of her books?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Peter to read one book. We know that he can read one book in 18 hours, so we can write: Peter's reading speed = 1 book / 18 hours Next, we need to find out how long it takes Kristin to read one book. We know that Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin, so we can write: Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * Peter's reading speed Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * (1 book / 18 hours) Kristin's reading speed = 1 book / 54 hours Now we can use Kristin's reading speed to find out how long it takes her to read half of her books. We know that she needs to read 20 books in a week, so she needs to read 10 books in half a week (3.5 days). We can write: Time to read 10 books = 10 books * (1 book / 54 hours) * (24 hours / 1 day) * (3.5 days) Time to read 10 books = 14 hours and 27 minutes Therefore, it will take Kristin 14 hours and 27 minutes to read half of her books. The answer is 27.\n\n\n"
