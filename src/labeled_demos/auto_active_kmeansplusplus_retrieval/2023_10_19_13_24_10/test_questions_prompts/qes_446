  "test_question": "Q: At Ashley's school, they start a reforestation campaign where each child plants a tree and each teacher plants 2 trees. The school has 40 classes with an average of 25 students and 3 teachers per class. How many trees will they have planted at the end of the campaign?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: There are four growing trees. The first tree grows 1 meter/day, the second grows the same amount in half the time, the third grows 2 meters/day, and the fourth tree grows a meter more than the third each day. How many meters did the trees grow in total in 4 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much the second tree grows per day. Since it grows the same amount as the first tree in half the time, it grows 2 meters/day. Now we can calculate how much each tree grows in 4 days: - The first tree grows 1 meter/day, so in 4 days it grows 4 meters. - The second tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The third tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The fourth tree grows 1 meter more than the third each day, so it grows 3 meters/day. In 4 days it grows 12 meters. Adding up the growth of all four trees, we get: 4 + 8 + 8 + 12 = 32 meters Therefore, the trees grew a total of 32 meters in 4 days. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many students are in Alice's class. We know that there are 40 students and 10 instructors, so the total number of people in the class is 40 + 10 = 50. Next, we need to figure out how many students are bringing their own life vests. We know that 20% of the students are bringing life vests, so we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of students by 0.2: 40 x 0.2 = 8. So 8 students are bringing their own life vests. Now we need to figure out how many life vests we still need. We have 20 life vests on hand, and we need one for each of the 50 people in the class. So we need 50 - 20 = 30 more life vests. However, we already know that 8 students are bringing their own life vests, so we can subtract those from the total number we need: 30 - 8 = 22. Therefore, Alice needs to get 22 more life vests so that the entire class has one. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Tracy has been collecting novels from her friends to donate to the Children For The Future charity organization. In the first week she collects a certain number of books. In the next five weeks, she collects ten times as many books as she did in the first week. How many books did she collect in the first week if she has 99 books now?\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that Tracy collected x number of books in the first week. According to the problem, in the next five weeks, she collected ten times as many books as she did in the first week. So, in the next five weeks, she collected 10x books. Therefore, the total number of books she collected is x + 10x = 11x. We also know that she has 99 books now. So, we can set up an equation: 11x = 99 To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 11: x = 9 Therefore, Tracy collected 9 books in the first week. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Aimee does a poll around her neighborhood and makes sure to get answers from 50% men and 50% women. She finds that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. How many people did she poll?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Aimee polled an equal number of men and women. Therefore, we can assume that 50% of the total number of people she polled are women. Let's call the total number of people she polled \"x\". Then, the number of women she polled is 0.5x. Next, we know that 35% of women are in favor of shortening the school day by 30 minutes. Therefore, the number of women in favor of this idea is 0.35(0.5x) = 0.175x. We also know that 39 women in her poll opposed this idea. Therefore, the number of women who did not support shortening the school day is 39. We can set up an equation to solve for x: 0.175x + 39 = 0.5x Simplifying this equation, we get: 39 = 0.325x x = 120 Therefore, Aimee polled 120 people in total. The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: Johnny is buying planks of wood to build some tables. Each table needs a plank of wood for each of the legs and 5 planks of wood for the surface. If Johnny wants to build 5 tables, how many planks of wood does he need?\nA: Let's think step by step. Each table needs 4 planks of wood for the legs (assuming it's a standard table with 4 legs). So for 5 tables, Johnny needs 5 x 4 = 20 planks of wood for the legs. Each table also needs 5 planks of wood for the surface, so for 5 tables, Johnny needs 5 x 5 = 25 planks of wood for the surfaces. Therefore, Johnny needs a total of 20 + 25 = 45 planks of wood to build 5 tables. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Dani brings two and half dozen cupcakes for her 2nd-grade class.  There are 27 students (including Dani), 1 teacher, and 1 teacher\u2019s aid.  If 3 students called in sick that day, how many cupcakes are left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Dani brought in total. Two and a half dozen cupcakes is equal to 30 cupcakes (since a dozen is 12). Next, we need to figure out how many people will be receiving cupcakes. There are 27 students, 1 teacher, and 1 teacher's aid, for a total of 29 people. However, 3 students called in sick, so we need to subtract them from the total. 29 - 3 = 26 people receiving cupcakes. Now, we need to subtract 26 cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes Dani brought. 30 - 26 = 4 cupcakes left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\n"
