  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Fran\u00e7oise sells pots of lily of the valley to fund humanitarian work. She buys them at \u20ac12 each and sells them at a 25% higher cost. How much will she give back to the association by selling 150 pots of lily of the valley?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the selling price of each pot of lily of the valley. Fran\u00e7oise sells them at a 25% higher cost than the buying price of \u20ac12, so we need to add 25% of \u20ac12 to \u20ac12: 25% of \u20ac12 = 0.25 x \u20ac12 = \u20ac3 Selling price = \u20ac12 + \u20ac3 = \u20ac15 Now we know that Fran\u00e7oise sells each pot of lily of the valley for \u20ac15. To calculate how much she will give back to the association by selling 150 pots, we need to multiply the selling price by the number of pots sold: \u20ac15 x 150 = \u20ac2250 Therefore, Fran\u00e7oise will give back \u20ac2250 to the association by selling 150 pots of lily of the valley. The answer is 150.\n\n\nQ: A gallon of whole milk that normally costs $3 is now sold at $2. A box of cereal was sold at a discount of $1. How much will you save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the discount for each gallon of whole milk. The discount is $3 - $2 = $1 per gallon. So, if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk, you will save 3 x $1 = $3. Next, let's calculate the discount for each box of cereal. The discount is $1 per box. So, if you buy 5 boxes of cereal, you will save 5 x $1 = $5. Therefore, the total amount you will save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal is $3 + $5 = $8. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of 18 watermelons. Since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, the total weight of 18 watermelons would be: 23 x 18 = 414 pounds Next, we need to find the total amount of money Farmer Kent would make by selling these watermelons. Since he sells them for $2 a pound, we can multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 414 x $2 = $828 Therefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Five people are planning a party. Sonja will buy a loaf of French bread ($3 a loaf) and a platter of cold cuts ($23). Barbara will buy the soda ($1 per person) and two boxes of crackers ($2 per box). Mario and Rick will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles ($3 per package). Danica will supply a package of paper plates for $4. How much more will Sonja spend than the rest of the office put together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of Barbara's contribution. She will buy soda for 5 people, which will cost $5 (1 dollar per person). She will also buy two boxes of crackers, which will cost $4 (2 dollars per box). Therefore, Barbara's total contribution will be $9. Next, let's calculate the total cost of Mario and Rick's contribution. They will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles, which will cost $6 in total (3 dollars per package). Now, let's add up the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's. Barbara's contribution is $9, Mario and Rick's contribution is $6, and Danica's contribution is $4. Therefore, the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's is $19. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of Sonja's contribution. She will buy a loaf of French bread for $3 and a platter of cold cuts for $23. Therefore, Sonja's total contribution will be $26. To find out how much more Sonja will spend than the rest of the office put together, we need to subtract the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's from Sonja's total contribution. $26 (Sonja's contribution) - $19 (total cost of everyone else's contribution) = $7 Therefore, Sonja will spend $7 more than the rest of the office put together. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how much money Carl will earn in four weeks. If he earns $0.50 every time, and he buys a candy bar each time, that means he's spending $0.50 each week. But he's also earning $0.75 each week for taking out his neighbor's trash. So his net earnings each week are $0.75 - $0.50 = $0.25. Over four weeks, that's a total of $0.25 x 4 = $1. So Carl will have $1 to spend on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.50, he can buy 2 candy bars with his earnings. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Since 1989, Lily has treated herself to 1 hydrangea plant, each year.  Each plant costs $20.00.  By 2021, how much money has Lily spent on hydrangeas?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many years it has been since 1989 to 2021. 2021 - 1989 = 32 years So, Lily has been treating herself to 1 hydrangea plant every year for 32 years. Next, we need to find out how much money Lily has spent on hydrangeas. 1 plant costs $20.00, so: 32 years x $20.00 per plant = $640.00 Therefore, Lily has spent $640.00 on hydrangeas since 1989. The answer is 1989.\n\n\nQ: A math teacher had $100 to buy three different types of calculators. A basic calculator costs $8. A scientific calculator costs twice the price as the basic while a graphing calculator costs thrice the price as the scientific. How much change did she receive after buying those three different types of calculators?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many calculators of each type the teacher can buy with $100. Let's start with the basic calculator. Each basic calculator costs $8, so the teacher can buy 100/8 = 12.5 basic calculators. Since we can't buy half a calculator, we'll round down to 12 basic calculators. Next, let's figure out how many scientific calculators the teacher can buy. Each scientific calculator costs twice as much as a basic calculator, so it costs $8 x 2 = $16. With $100, the teacher can buy 100/16 = 6.25 scientific calculators. Again, we'll round down to 6 scientific calculators. Finally, let's figure out how many graphing calculators the teacher can buy. Each graphing calculator costs three times as much as a scientific calculator, so it costs $16 x 3 = $48. With $100, the teacher can buy 100/48 = 2.08 graphing calculators. We'll round down to 2 graphing calculators. So in total, the teacher can buy 12 basic calculators, 6 scientific calculators, and 2 graphing calculators. The cost of the basic calculators is 12 x $8 = $96. The cost of the scientific calculators is 6 x $16 = $96. The cost of the graphing calculators is 2 x $48 = $96. So the total cost of all the calculators is $96 + $96 + $96 = $288. The teacher started with $100, so she received $100 - $288 = -$188 in change. However, since she didn't have enough money to buy all the calculators she wanted, she actually owes $188. The answer is 188.\n\n\nQ: John buys 500 newspapers.  Each newspaper sells for $2.  He sells 80% of them.  He buys them all for 75% less than the price at which he sells them.  How much profit does he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much John buys the newspapers for. He buys them for 75% less than the price at which he sells them, which means he buys them for 25% of the selling price. 25% of the selling price = 0.25 x 2 = $0.50 So, John buys each newspaper for $0.50. Next, let's calculate how much John earns from selling the newspapers. He sells 80% of the 500 newspapers, which is: 0.8 x 500 = 400 newspapers He sells each newspaper for $2, so his total earnings are: 400 x 2 = $800 Now, let's calculate how much John spent on buying the newspapers: 500 x 0.50 = $250 Therefore, John's profit is: $800 - $250 = $550 So, John makes a profit of $550. The answer is 550.\n\n\n"
