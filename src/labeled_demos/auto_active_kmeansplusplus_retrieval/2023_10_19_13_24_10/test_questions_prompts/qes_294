  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of 18 watermelons. Since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, the total weight of 18 watermelons would be: 23 x 18 = 414 pounds Next, we need to find the total amount of money Farmer Kent would make by selling these watermelons. Since he sells them for $2 a pound, we can multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 414 x $2 = $828 Therefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Parker went to the gym and found 4 twenty pounds dumbbells set up for weightlifting. He added two more dumbbells to the setup and started his exercises. How many pounds of dumbbells is Parker using for his exercises?\nA: Let's think step by step. Parker started with 4 twenty pounds dumbbells, which means he was using 4 x 20 = 80 pounds of dumbbells for his exercises. Then he added two more dumbbells, but we don't know how much each of them weighs. Let's call the weight of each new dumbbell \"x\". So now Parker is using a total of (4 + 2) dumbbells, which is 6 dumbbells in total. The weight of each dumbbell is either 20 pounds (the original ones) or x pounds (the new ones). Therefore, the total weight of dumbbells that Parker is using for his exercises is: 80 + 2x We don't know the value of x, so we can't calculate the exact weight. But we do know that it's at least 20 pounds (since the original dumbbells were 20 pounds each). The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. If Mabel has 85 marbles, how many more marbles does Mabel have than Amanda?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Katrina has. We know that Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 85 marbles, so we can set up an equation: Mabel's marbles = 5 x Katrina's marbles 85 = 5 x Katrina's marbles Katrina's marbles = 17 Now we know that Katrina has 17 marbles. We also know that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. So we can set up another equation: Amanda's marbles = 2 x Katrina's marbles + 12 Amanda's marbles = 2 x 17 + 12 Amanda's marbles = 46 So Amanda has 46 marbles. Finally, we can figure out how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda: Mabel's marbles - Amanda's marbles = 85 - 46 Mabel's marbles - Amanda's marbles = 39 Therefore, Mabel has 39 more marbles than Amanda. The answer is 39.\n\n\nQ: Sally, Sam, and Steve went to play with their marbles. In the beginning, Sam has twice as many marbles as Steve while Sally has 5 less than Sam. After Sam has given Sally and Steve 3 marbles each, Sam has 8 marbles left. How many marbles does Steve have now?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Sam had in the beginning. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve, so let's call the number of marbles Steve had \"x\". This means that Sam had 2x marbles. Next, we know that Sally had 5 less marbles than Sam, so Sally had 2x - 5 marbles. After Sam gave 3 marbles each to Sally and Steve, he was left with 8 marbles. This means that he gave away a total of 6 marbles (3 to Sally and 3 to Steve), so he must have started with 14 marbles (8 + 6 = 14). Now we can use this information to figure out how many marbles Steve has. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve in the beginning, so if Sam had 14 marbles, Steve must have had 7 marbles (14 \u00f7 2 = 7). After Sam gave Steve 3 marbles, Steve now has 10 marbles (7 + 3 = 10). The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Peter and Kristin are to read 20 fantasy novels each in a week. Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin. If Peter reads one book in 18 hours, how long will Kristin read half of her books?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Peter to read one book. We know that he can read one book in 18 hours, so we can write: Peter's reading speed = 1 book / 18 hours Next, we need to find out how long it takes Kristin to read one book. We know that Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin, so we can write: Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * Peter's reading speed Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * (1 book / 18 hours) Kristin's reading speed = 1 book / 54 hours Now we can use Kristin's reading speed to find out how long it takes her to read half of her books. We know that she needs to read 20 books in a week, so she needs to read 10 books in half a week (3.5 days). We can write: Time to read 10 books = 10 books * (1 book / 54 hours) * (24 hours / 1 day) * (3.5 days) Time to read 10 books = 14 hours and 27 minutes Therefore, it will take Kristin 14 hours and 27 minutes to read half of her books. The answer is 27.\n\n\nQ: Karina was born in 1970 and she is currently twice as old as her brother. If her current age is 40, in what year was her brother born?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Karina's current age is 40. We also know that she is currently twice as old as her brother. Therefore, we can set up an equation: 40 = 2x where x is her brother's current age. Solving for x, we get: x = 20 So Karina's brother is currently 20 years old. Next, we need to figure out in what year he was born. We know that Karina was born in 1970, so we can subtract her brother's age from that year: 1970 - 20 = 1950 Therefore, Karina's brother was born in 1950. The answer is 1950.\n\n\nQ: Tom turned 32 years old 5 years ago.  7 years ago Jim was 5 years older than half Tom's age.  How old is Jim in 2 years?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find Tom's current age. We know that he turned 32 years old 5 years ago, so we can add 32 and 5 to get his current age: Tom's current age = 32 + 5 = 37 Next, we need to figure out how old Jim was 7 years ago. We know that 7 years ago, Jim was 5 years older than half of Tom's age. Half of Tom's age is: 37 / 2 = 18.5 So 7 years ago, Jim was: 18.5 + 5 = 23.5 Now we need to find Jim's current age. We know that 7 years have passed since we calculated Jim's age, so we need to add 7 to his age: Jim's current age = 23.5 + 7 = 30.5 Finally, we need to find Jim's age in 2 years. We can simply add 2 to his current age: Jim's age in 2 years = 30.5 + 2 = 32.5 Therefore, Jim will be 32.5 years old in 2 years. The answer is 2.\n\n\n"
