  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The owner of a Turkish restaurant wanted to prepare traditional dishes for an upcoming celebration. She ordered ground beef, in four-pound packages, from three different butchers. The following morning, the first butcher delivered 10 packages. A couple of hours later, 7 packages arrived from the second butcher. Finally, the third butcher\u2019s delivery arrived at dusk. If all the ground beef delivered by the three butchers weighed 100 pounds, how many packages did the third butcher deliver?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of packages delivered by the first two butchers. The first butcher delivered 10 packages, and the second butcher delivered 7 packages. So, the total number of packages delivered by the first two butchers is 10 + 7 = 17 packages. Now, we need to find the total weight of the ground beef delivered by the first two butchers. Each package weighs 4 pounds, so the total weight of the ground beef delivered by the first two butchers is 17 x 4 = 68 pounds. We know that the total weight of the ground beef delivered by all three butchers is 100 pounds. So, the weight of the ground beef delivered by the third butcher is 100 - 68 = 32 pounds. Since each package weighs 4 pounds, the third butcher delivered 32/4 = 8 packages. Therefore, the third butcher delivered 8 packages. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: A train leaves its departure station with 6 coal cars, 12 iron cars, and 2 wood cars. Between each station, there are 6 miles, and it takes 25 minutes to travel between them. At each station, the train can deposit up to 2 coal cars, 3 iron cars, and 1 wood car. How many minutes will it take to deliver all the cars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find the total number of cars the train has: 6 coal cars + 12 iron cars + 2 wood cars = 20 cars Next, let's find the maximum number of cars the train can deposit at each station: 2 coal cars + 3 iron cars + 1 wood car = 6 cars To deliver all 20 cars, the train will need to make multiple trips between stations. For each trip, the train can deposit 6 cars. So, the number of trips the train will need to make is: 20 cars \u00f7 6 cars per trip = 3.33 trips Since the train cannot make a partial trip, it will need to make 4 trips. Each trip takes 25 minutes, so the total time it will take to deliver all the cars is: 4 trips x 25 minutes per trip = 100 minutes The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Jacque arrived in France and his suitcase weighed 5 pounds.  While in France, he picked up 5 bottles of perfume that weighed 1.2 ounces each, 4 pounds of chocolate, 2 bars of soap that weighed 5 ounces each and 2 jars of jam that weighed 8 ounces each.  Considering 16 ounces is the same as 1 pound, how much did Jacque's suitcase weigh on the return flight home?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the weight of the perfume bottles from ounces to pounds. Since 16 ounces is equal to 1 pound, we can divide 1.2 ounces by 16 to get the weight of one bottle in pounds: 1.2 ounces \u00f7 16 = 0.075 pounds Since Jacque picked up 5 bottles, we can multiply the weight of one bottle by 5 to get the total weight of the perfume: 0.075 pounds/bottle x 5 bottles = 0.375 pounds Next, we need to add the weight of the chocolate, soap, and jam in pounds: 4 pounds (chocolate) + 0.625 pounds (soap and jam) = 4.625 pounds Finally, we can add the weight of the perfume and the other items to the weight of Jacque's suitcase when he arrived in France: 5 pounds (suitcase) + 0.375 pounds (perfume) + 4.625 pounds (chocolate, soap, and jam) = 10 pounds Therefore, Jacque's suitcase weighed 10 pounds on the return flight home. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Paul has five dogs. For every 10 pounds they weigh, they need 1 pound of dog food per day. One weighs 20 pounds. One weighs 40. Another weighs 10. One weighs 30 and the final one weighs 50 pounds. How much dog food does he need each day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total weight of all five dogs. Total weight = 20 + 40 + 10 + 30 + 50 = 150 pounds Next, we need to calculate how much dog food is needed per day for every 10 pounds of weight. 1 pound of dog food is needed for every 10 pounds of weight So, for 150 pounds of weight, we need: 150/10 = 15 pounds of dog food per day Therefore, Paul needs 15 pounds of dog food each day to feed his five dogs. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Marie, the confectioner, makes 12 chocolate eggs, each weighing 10 ounces. She then packs an equal number of the eggs in 4 different gift boxes. Unfortunately, she leaves one of the boxes by the kitchen window and the afternoon sun melts everything. She tosses that box out. What is the total weight, in ounces, of the remaining chocolate eggs?\nA: Let's think step by step. Marie makes 12 chocolate eggs, each weighing 10 ounces. So the total weight of all the eggs is: 12 x 10 = 120 ounces Marie packs an equal number of eggs in 4 different gift boxes. So each box contains: 120 / 4 = 30 ounces But one of the boxes is tossed out, so we need to subtract the weight of that box from the total weight of the eggs. Therefore, the total weight of the remaining chocolate eggs is: (3 boxes) x (30 ounces per box) = 90 ounces The answer is 90.\n\n\nQ: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of 18 watermelons. Since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, the total weight of 18 watermelons would be: 23 x 18 = 414 pounds Next, we need to find the total amount of money Farmer Kent would make by selling these watermelons. Since he sells them for $2 a pound, we can multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 414 x $2 = $828 Therefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Emily goes fishing and has a very busy day. She catches 4 trout, 3 catfish, and 5 bluegills. If the trout weigh 2 pounds each, the catfish weigh 1.5 pounds each, and the bluegills weigh 2.5 pounds each, how many total pounds of fish did she catch?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total weight of the trout. Emily caught 4 trout, and each trout weighs 2 pounds, so the total weight of the trout is: 4 trout x 2 pounds/trout = 8 pounds Next, we need to calculate the total weight of the catfish. Emily caught 3 catfish, and each catfish weighs 1.5 pounds, so the total weight of the catfish is: 3 catfish x 1.5 pounds/catfish = 4.5 pounds Finally, we need to calculate the total weight of the bluegills. Emily caught 5 bluegills, and each bluegill weighs 2.5 pounds, so the total weight of the bluegills is: 5 bluegills x 2.5 pounds/bluegill = 12.5 pounds Now, we can add up the weight of all the fish to find the total weight: 8 pounds + 4.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds = 25 pounds Therefore, Emily caught a total of 25 pounds of fish. The answer is 25.\n\n\nQ: John carves a giant marble rectangular prism 8 meters tall with a 2-meter square base.  It has a density of 2700 kg per cubic meter.  How much does it weigh?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the volume of the rectangular prism. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is V = l x w x h, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height. In this case, we know that the height is 8 meters and the base is 2 meters square, so the length and width must also be 2 meters each. Therefore, the volume of the rectangular prism is: V = 2 x 2 x 8 = 32 cubic meters Next, we need to find the weight of the rectangular prism. We know that the density of the marble is 2700 kg per cubic meter, so we can use the formula: weight = density x volume Substituting the values we know, we get: weight = 2700 x 32 = 86,400 kg Therefore, the giant marble rectangular prism weighs 86,400 kg. The answer is 86400.\n\n\n"
