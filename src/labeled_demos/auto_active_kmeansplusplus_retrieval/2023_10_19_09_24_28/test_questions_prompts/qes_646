  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Marco has $24. Mary has $15. If Marco gives Mary half of what he has, Mary will have more than Marco. But Mary spends $5. How much more money does Mary have than Marco?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much money Marco gives to Mary. Since Marco has $24, half of that would be $12. So, Marco gives $12 to Mary. After receiving $12 from Marco, Mary will have $15 + $12 = $27. However, Mary spends $5, so we need to subtract that from her total. $27 - $5 = $22. Therefore, Mary has $22 more than Marco. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Eric has 20 marbles. He has 12 white marbles, 6 blue marbles, and the rest are green marbles. How many green marbles does Eric have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Eric has a total of 20 marbles. Out of those 20 marbles, he has 12 white marbles and 6 blue marbles. To find out how many green marbles he has, we need to subtract the number of white and blue marbles from the total number of marbles: 20 - 12 - 6 = 2 Therefore, Eric has 2 green marbles. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Jim had 365 trading cards. He gives 8 sets of cards to his brother, 5 sets of cards to his sister, and 2 sets of cards to his friend. How many cards did he give away, assuming 1 set has 13 trading cards?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cards are in one set. We know that one set has 13 trading cards, so we can multiply 13 by the number of sets given away to find the total number of cards given away. Jim gave 8 sets of cards to his brother, so he gave away 8 x 13 = 104 cards. Jim also gave 5 sets of cards to his sister, so he gave away 5 x 13 = 65 cards. Finally, Jim gave 2 sets of cards to his friend, so he gave away 2 x 13 = 26 cards. To find the total number of cards Jim gave away, we can add up the number of cards given away to each person: 104 + 65 + 26 = 195 Therefore, Jim gave away a total of 195 trading cards. The answer is 195.\n\n\nQ: Susan is playing a board game with 48 spaces from the starting space to the winning end space of the game. On the first turn, she moves forward eight spaces. On the second turn, she moves two spaces, but lands on a space that sends her back five spaces. On the third turn, she moves forward six more spaces. How many spaces does she have to move to reach the ending space and win the game?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first turn, Susan moves forward 8 spaces. So, she has 48 - 8 = 40 spaces left to reach the ending space. On the second turn, she moves forward 2 spaces but lands on a space that sends her back 5 spaces. So, she moves back 5 spaces from her current position, which is 8 + 2 = 10 spaces from the starting space. Therefore, she is now at 10 - 5 = 5 spaces from the starting space. She has 48 - 5 = 43 spaces left to reach the ending space. On the third turn, she moves forward 6 spaces. So, she has 43 - 6 = 37 spaces left to reach the ending space. Therefore, Susan has to move 37 spaces to reach the ending space and win the game. The answer is 37.\n\n\nQ: Sally, Sam, and Steve went to play with their marbles. In the beginning, Sam has twice as many marbles as Steve while Sally has 5 less than Sam. After Sam has given Sally and Steve 3 marbles each, Sam has 8 marbles left. How many marbles does Steve have now?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Sam had in the beginning. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve, so let's call the number of marbles Steve had \"x\". This means that Sam had 2x marbles. Next, we know that Sally had 5 less marbles than Sam, so Sally had 2x - 5 marbles. After Sam gave 3 marbles each to Sally and Steve, he was left with 8 marbles. This means that he gave away a total of 6 marbles (3 to Sally and 3 to Steve), so he must have started with 14 marbles (8 + 6 = 14). Now we can use this information to figure out how many marbles Steve has. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve in the beginning, so if Sam had 14 marbles, Steve must have had 7 marbles (14 \u00f7 2 = 7). After Sam gave Steve 3 marbles, Steve now has 10 marbles (7 + 3 = 10). The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Padma is trading cards with Robert. Padma started with 75 cards and traded 2 or her valuable ones for 10 of Robert's cards. Robert started with 88 of his own cards and traded another 8 of his cards for 15 of Padma's cards. How many cards were traded between both Padma and Robert?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Padma traded 2 of her cards for 10 of Robert's cards. This means she now has 75 - 2 + 10 = 83 cards, and Robert has 88 - 10 = 78 cards. Next, Robert traded 8 of his cards for 15 of Padma's cards. This means he now has 78 - 8 = 70 cards, and Padma has 83 - 15 = 68 cards. In total, Padma traded 2 + 15 = 17 cards, and Robert traded 10 + 8 = 18 cards. Therefore, the total number of cards traded between both Padma and Robert is 17 + 18 = 35 cards. The answer is 35.\n\n\nQ: Miriam currently has 30 marbles, but she used to have more. Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, gave her sister twice that amount and gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has. How many marbles did Miriam start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, so she now has 30 - 60 = -30 marbles. This doesn't make sense, so we know that Miriam must have started with more than 60 marbles. Next, we know that Miriam gave her sister twice the amount she gave her brother, so her sister received 2 * 60 = 120 marbles. We also know that Miriam gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has, so Savanna received 3 * 30 = 90 marbles. In total, Miriam gave away 60 + 120 + 90 = 270 marbles. If Miriam started with x marbles, we can set up the equation: x - 270 = 30 Solving for x, we get: x = 300 Therefore, Miriam started with 300 marbles. The answer is 300.\n\n\nQ: Janessa has a plan to give her brother Dexter his first collection of baseball cards. She currently has 4 cards in addition to the 13 that her father gave her.  She ordered a collection of 36 cards from eBay. After inspecting the cards she found 4 cards are in bad shape and decides to throw them away. Janessa ended up giving Dexter 29 cards. How many cards did Janessa keep for herself?\nA: Let's think step by step. Janessa started with 4 cards and received 13 from her father, so she had 4 + 13 = 17 cards. She then ordered 36 cards from eBay, bringing her total to 17 + 36 = 53 cards. After throwing away 4 bad cards, she had 53 - 4 = 49 cards left. She gave Dexter 29 cards, so she kept 49 - 29 = 20 cards for herself. Therefore, Janessa kept 20 cards for herself. The answer is 20.\n\n\n"
