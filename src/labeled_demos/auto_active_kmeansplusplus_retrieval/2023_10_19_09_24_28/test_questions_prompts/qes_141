  "test_question": "Q: Jillian's handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes cost. If her shoes cost $80, how much did her bag cost?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A department store offers a 10% discount for the amount exceeding $100 of the customer's total charge. Jaco bought a pair of shoes for $74; 2 pairs of socks that cost $2 per pair; a bag that costs $42. How much will Jaco pay for those items?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jaco bought: - Shoes: $74 - Socks: 2 pairs x $2 per pair = $4 - Bag: $42 Total cost = $74 + $4 + $42 = $120 Since the total cost exceeds $100, Jaco is eligible for a discount. The amount that exceeds $100 is $20 ($120 - $100). The discount is 10% of $20, which is $2. Therefore, Jaco will pay the total cost minus the discount: Total cost - discount = $120 - $2 = $118 Jaco will pay $118 for those items. The answer is 118.\n\n\nQ: Yanna bought ten shirts at $5 each and three pairs of sandals at $3 each.  How much change did she get back if she gave a one hundred dollar bill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of the shirts. 10 shirts x $5 per shirt = $50 Next, let's calculate the total cost of the sandals. 3 pairs of sandals x $3 per pair = $9 Now, let's add the cost of the shirts and sandals together to find the total cost. $50 + $9 = $59 Yanna gave a $100 bill, so we need to subtract the total cost from $100 to find the change. $100 - $59 = $41 Therefore, Yanna received $41 in change. The answer is 41.\n\n\nQ: To buy a book, you pay $20 for each of the first 5 books at the supermarket, and for each additional book you buy over $20, you receive a discount of $2. If Beatrice bought 20 books, how much did she pay at the supermarket?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the first 5 books, which is simply: $20 x 5 = $100 Next, we need to calculate the cost of the remaining 15 books. Since Beatrice gets a $2 discount for each book over $20, we can calculate the cost of each book as: $20 - $2 = $18 Therefore, the cost of the remaining 15 books is: $18 x 15 = $270 Finally, we can calculate the total cost by adding the cost of the first 5 books to the cost of the remaining 15 books: $100 + $270 = $370 Therefore, Beatrice paid $370 at the supermarket for 20 books. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Marcus wants to buy a new pair of shoes. He decided to pay not more than $130 for them. He found a pair for $120, on which he got a discount of 30%. How much money will he manage to save by buying these shoes and not spending the assumed maximum amount?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the discount Marcus got on the shoes. Discount = 30% of $120 = 0.3 x $120 = $36 This means Marcus paid $120 - $36 = $84 for the shoes. Now we can calculate how much money he saved by buying these shoes instead of spending the maximum amount of $130. Savings = $130 - $84 = $46 Therefore, Marcus managed to save $46 by buying these shoes and not spending the assumed maximum amount. The answer is 46.\n\n\nQ: Whitney\u2019s mom gave her two $20 bills to spend at the school book fair. Whitney has decided to buy 2 posters, 3 notebooks, and 2 bookmarks. Each poster costs $5, each notebook costs $4, and each bookmark costs $2. How much money, in dollars, will Whitney have left over after the purchase?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of the posters. Whitney is buying 2 posters, and each poster costs $5, so the total cost of the posters is 2 x $5 = $10. Next, let's calculate the total cost of the notebooks. Whitney is buying 3 notebooks, and each notebook costs $4, so the total cost of the notebooks is 3 x $4 = $12. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the bookmarks. Whitney is buying 2 bookmarks, and each bookmark costs $2, so the total cost of the bookmarks is 2 x $2 = $4. Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Whitney is buying: $10 + $12 + $4 = $26. Whitney started with two $20 bills, which is a total of $40. After spending $26 on the posters, notebooks, and bookmarks, she will have $40 - $26 = $14 left over. Therefore, Whitney will have $14 left over after the purchase. The answer is 14.\n\n\nQ: Saheed made four times as much money as Kayla. Kayla made $30 less than Vika. Vika made $84. How many dollars did Saheed make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Vika made $84. Kayla made $30 less than Vika, so Kayla made $84 - $30 = $54. Saheed made four times as much money as Kayla, so Saheed made 4 x $54 = $216. Therefore, Saheed made $216. The answer is 216.\n\n\nQ: Ella has 4 bags with 20 apples in each bag and six bags with 25 apples in each bag. If Ella sells 200 apples, how many apples does Ella has left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many apples Ella has in total. She has 4 bags with 20 apples in each bag, so that's 4 x 20 = 80 apples. She also has 6 bags with 25 apples in each bag, so that's 6 x 25 = 150 apples. In total, Ella has 80 + 150 = 230 apples. If she sells 200 apples, we can subtract that from the total: 230 - 200 = 30 Therefore, Ella has 30 apples left. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: Kathleen saved $21 in June, $46 in July, and $45 in August. Then Kathleen spent $12 on school supplies and $54 on new clothes. Kathleen\u2019s aunt said she would give Kathleen $25 if Kathleen saves more than $125.  How much money does Kathleen have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total amount of money Kathleen saved in those three months. Total savings = $21 + $46 + $45 = $112 Next, we need to subtract the amount Kathleen spent on school supplies and new clothes. Total spent = $12 + $54 = $66 Kathleen's remaining savings = Total savings - Total spent = $112 - $66 = $46 Finally, we need to check if Kathleen saved more than $125 to see if she will receive the additional $25 from her aunt. Total savings + $25 > $125 $46 + $25 > $125 $71 > $125 (False) Since Kathleen did not save more than $125, she will not receive the additional $25 from her aunt. Therefore, Kathleen has $46 left. The answer is 46.\n\n\n"
