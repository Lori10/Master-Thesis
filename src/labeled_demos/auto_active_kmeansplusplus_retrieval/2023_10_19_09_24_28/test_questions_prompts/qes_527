  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Six more than twice as many ducks go to North Pond as go to Lake Michigan. If Lake Michigan has 100 ducks, how many ducks can you safely estimate there will be at North Pond?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many ducks go to North Pond. We know that \"Six more than twice as many ducks go to North Pond as go to Lake Michigan.\" So, we can start by finding twice as many ducks as Lake Michigan: 2 x 100 = 200 Now, we add six to that: 200 + 6 = 206 Therefore, we can safely estimate that there will be 206 ducks at North Pond. The answer is 206.\n\n\nQ: An apple tree produces 40 apples in its first year.  The second year the apple tree produces 8 more than double the amount of apples that it produced the first year, and the third year production went down by a fourth due to an insect infestation.  How many apples did the tree produce in total in the first three years?\nA: Let's think step by step. First year: 40 apples Second year: 8 more than double the amount of apples produced in the first year Double the amount of apples produced in the first year: 40 x 2 = 80 apples 8 more than double the amount of apples produced in the first year: 80 + 8 = 88 apples Third year: production went down by a fourth due to an insect infestation One fourth of the second year's production: 88 / 4 = 22 apples Third year's production: 88 - 22 = 66 apples Total production in the first three years: 40 + 88 + 66 = 194 apples. Therefore, the apple tree produced 194 apples in total in the first three years. The answer is 194.\n\n\nQ: Mr. Maximilian is a dairy animal farmer and has 140 cows on his farm. Forty percent of the cows on his farm have a red spot, 25 percent of the cows without a red spot have a blue spot and the remaining cows do not have any spot. How many cows on the farm have no spot?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cows have a red spot. We can do this by multiplying the total number of cows (140) by the percentage that have a red spot (40% or 0.4): 140 x 0.4 = 56 cows with a red spot Next, we need to find out how many cows without a red spot have a blue spot. We can do this by subtracting the number of cows with a red spot from the total number of cows and then multiplying that by the percentage that have a blue spot (25% or 0.25): (140 - 56) x 0.25 = 21 cows without a red spot but with a blue spot Now we can find out how many cows have no spot by subtracting the number of cows with a red spot and the number of cows without a red spot but with a blue spot from the total number of cows: 140 - 56 - 21 = 63 cows with no spot Therefore, there are 63 cows on the farm with no spot. The answer is 63.\n\n\nQ: Janet uses her horses' manure as fertilizer. One horse produces 5 gallons of fertilizer per day. Once Janet has collected enough fertilizer, she'll spread it over 20 acres of farmland. Each acre needs 400 gallons of fertilizer and Janet can spread fertilizer over 4 acres per day. If Janet has 80 horses, how long will it take until all her fields are fertilized?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much fertilizer is needed for all 20 acres. Since each acre needs 400 gallons of fertilizer, we can multiply 20 acres by 400 gallons per acre to get: 20 acres x 400 gallons per acre = 8,000 gallons of fertilizer Next, we need to figure out how many days it will take Janet to spread all the fertilizer. Since she can spread fertilizer over 4 acres per day, we can divide the total number of acres by 4 to get: 20 acres \u00f7 4 acres per day = 5 days So it will take Janet 5 days to spread all the fertilizer. Now we need to figure out how much fertilizer she can collect each day. Since each horse produces 5 gallons of fertilizer per day, and she has 80 horses, we can multiply 5 gallons per horse by 80 horses to get: 5 gallons per horse x 80 horses = 400 gallons of fertilizer per day So Janet can collect 400 gallons of fertilizer per day. Finally, we can divide the total amount of fertilizer needed by the amount of fertilizer she can collect per day to get: 8,000 gallons of fertilizer \u00f7 400 gallons per day = 20 days So it will take Janet 20 days to collect enough fertilizer to fertilize all her fields. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much milk one cow produces in a week. We can do this by dividing the total amount of milk produced in 5 weeks (2160 liters) by the number of weeks (5) and the number of cows (x): 2160 = 6x * 108 * 5 2160 = 540x x = 4 Therefore, there are 4 cows on the farm. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Farmer Brown raises emus, large birds. His flock has a total of 60 heads and legs. How many emus are in his flock?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine how many legs an emu has. Emus are birds, so they have two legs. Next, we need to determine how many legs are in the entire flock. If there are x emus in the flock, then there are 2x legs in total. We know that the total number of heads and legs is 60. So, we can set up an equation: 2x + x = 60 Simplifying: 3x = 60 x = 20 Therefore, there are 20 emus in Farmer Brown's flock. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Next year, there will be twice as many people going to the fair as are going this year, and the number of people who went to the fair last year was 200 less than those going next year. If the number of people going to the fair this year is 600, calculate the number of people at the fair in the three years.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the number of people going to the fair next year will be twice the number of people going this year. So, we can calculate: Number of people going to the fair next year = 2 * 600 = 1200 Next, we know that the number of people who went to the fair last year was 200 less than those going next year. So, we can calculate: Number of people who went to the fair last year = 1200 - 200 = 1000 Finally, we want to calculate the total number of people at the fair in the three years. So, we can add up the number of people going this year, next year, and last year: Total number of people at the fair in the three years = 600 + 1200 + 1000 = 2800 Therefore, there will be 2800 people at the fair in the three years. The answer is 2800.\n\n\nQ: Ella has 4 bags with 20 apples in each bag and six bags with 25 apples in each bag. If Ella sells 200 apples, how many apples does Ella has left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many apples Ella has in total. She has 4 bags with 20 apples in each bag, so that's 4 x 20 = 80 apples. She also has 6 bags with 25 apples in each bag, so that's 6 x 25 = 150 apples. In total, Ella has 80 + 150 = 230 apples. If she sells 200 apples, we can subtract that from the total: 230 - 200 = 30 Therefore, Ella has 30 apples left. The answer is 30.\n\n\n"
