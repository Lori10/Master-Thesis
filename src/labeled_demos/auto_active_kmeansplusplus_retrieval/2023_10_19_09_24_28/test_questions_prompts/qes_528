  "test_question": "Q: John brings his dog to the vet. His dog needs 2 vaccines, which are $20 each, and a heartworm check. The heartworm check is 60% of his total bill. If he brought $125 with him, how much does he leave with?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: John adopts a dog from a shelter.  The dog ends up having health problems and this requires 3 vet appointments,  which cost $400 each.  After the first appointment, John paid $100 for pet insurance that covers 80% of the subsequent visits.  How much did he pay in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, John paid $400 for the first vet appointment. Then, he paid $100 for pet insurance that covers 80% of the subsequent visits. This means that for the next two vet appointments, he will only have to pay 20% of the cost. So for the second and third vet appointments, John will pay: 20% of $400 = $80 Therefore, the total cost for the three vet appointments will be: $400 (first appointment) + $80 (second appointment) + $80 (third appointment) = $560 So John paid a total of $560 for the three vet appointments. The answer is 560.\n\n\nQ: Mr. Sean has a veterinary clinic where he charges clients $60 to treat a dog and $40 to care for a cat. If Khalil took 20 dogs and 60 cats to the clinic for treatment, how much money did he pay Mr. Sean?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of treating 20 dogs. 20 dogs x $60/dog = $1200 Next, we need to calculate the cost of caring for 60 cats. 60 cats x $40/cat = $2400 Finally, we add the cost of treating the dogs and caring for the cats to find the total cost. $1200 + $2400 = $3600 Therefore, Khalil paid Mr. Sean $3600 for treating 20 dogs and 60 cats. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: It cost 50 dollars to get cats ready for adoption, 100 dollars to get adult dogs ready for adoption, and 150 to get puppies ready for adoption.  If 2 cats, 3 adult dogs, and 2 puppies are adopted what was the cost to get them ready?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of getting 2 cats ready for adoption, which is 2 x $50 = $100. Next, we need to calculate the cost of getting 3 adult dogs ready for adoption, which is 3 x $100 = $300. Finally, we need to calculate the cost of getting 2 puppies ready for adoption, which is 2 x $150 = $300. Therefore, the total cost to get all the animals ready for adoption is $100 + $300 + $300 = $700. The answer is 700.\n\n\nQ: Harris feeds his dog 1 large organic carrot over the course of 1 day.  There are 5 carrots in a 1 pound bag and each bag costs $2.00.  In one year, how much will Harris spend on carrots?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many pounds of carrots Harris will need in a year. Since he feeds his dog 1 carrot per day, he will need 365 carrots in a year. Next, we need to figure out how many bags of carrots he will need. If there are 5 carrots in a bag, then he will need 365/5 = 73 bags of carrots in a year. Finally, we can calculate the cost of the carrots. Each bag costs $2.00, so 73 bags will cost 73 x $2.00 = $146.00. Therefore, Harris will spend $146.00 on carrots in one year. The answer is 146.\n\n\nQ: Larry spends half an hour twice a day walking and playing with his dog. He also spends a fifth of an hour every day feeding his dog. How many minutes does Larry spend on his dog each day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many minutes Larry spends walking and playing with his dog each day. Larry spends half an hour twice a day, so that's 0.5 x 2 = 1 hour per day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Larry spends 1 x 60 = 60 minutes per day walking and playing with his dog. Next, we need to find out how many minutes Larry spends feeding his dog each day. Larry spends a fifth of an hour feeding his dog, which is 0.2 hours. Again, since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Larry spends 0.2 x 60 = 12 minutes per day feeding his dog. Finally, we can add the time Larry spends walking and playing with his dog to the time he spends feeding his dog to find out how many minutes he spends on his dog each day. Larry spends 60 + 12 = 72 minutes on his dog each day. The answer is 72.\n\n\nQ: Van Helsing gets paid by the town to remove all the vampires and werewolves. He gets $5 per vampire and $10 per werewolf. He removes half the vampires and removes 8 werewolves, and earned $105. There were 4 times as many werewolves as vampires. What percentage of the werewolves did he remove?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assign variables to the unknowns in the problem. Let's call the number of vampires \"V\" and the number of werewolves \"W\". We know that Van Helsing gets paid $5 per vampire and removes half of them, so he earns 5*(1/2)V = 2.5V dollars from the vampires. We also know that he gets paid $10 per werewolf and removes 8 of them, so he earns 10*(W-8) dollars from the werewolves. Finally, we know that there were 4 times as many werewolves as vampires, so W = 4V. Putting all of this together, we can create an equation to solve for V: 2.5V + 10(4V-8) = 105 Simplifying this equation, we get: 42.5V = 185 V = 4.35 Since we can't have a fraction of a vampire, we'll round up to 5 vampires. Using the equation W = 4V, we can find that there were 20 werewolves. Van Helsing removed 8 werewolves, so he removed 8/20 = 0.4 or 40% of the werewolves. The answer is 40.\n\n\nQ: Samuel is going to the cinema with his brother, Kevin. They both have a total budget of $20 for their outing. Samuel buys his $14 ticket, then spends $6 on drinks and food. Kevin buys his ticket, then spends $2 on drinks. They have both used their entire budget. How much did Kevin spend on food?\nA: Let's think step by step. Samuel spent $14 on his ticket and $6 on food and drinks, which means he spent a total of $20. This means that Kevin must have spent $0 on food and drinks, since they both used their entire budget of $20. Therefore, Kevin spent $6 on his ticket and $2 on drinks, which means he spent a total of $8. Since he didn't spend any money on food, the answer is $0. The answer is 0.\n\n\nQ: Maria's monthly salary is $2000. 20% of her salary goes to paying tax, and 5% goes to insurance. Also, a quarter of the money left after the deductions is spent on utility bills. How much money does Maria have after the deductions and utility bills payment?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money goes to tax and insurance. Tax: 20% of $2000 = 0.2 x $2000 = $400 Insurance: 5% of $2000 = 0.05 x $2000 = $100 Next, we need to subtract the total amount of tax and insurance from Maria's monthly salary to find out how much money she has left. $2000 - $400 - $100 = $1500 Now, we need to find out how much money Maria spends on utility bills. A quarter of $1500 = 0.25 x $1500 = $375 Finally, we need to subtract the amount spent on utility bills from the money Maria has left after the deductions. $1500 - $375 = $1125 Therefore, Maria has $1125 left after the deductions and utility bills payment. The answer is 1125.\n\n\n"
