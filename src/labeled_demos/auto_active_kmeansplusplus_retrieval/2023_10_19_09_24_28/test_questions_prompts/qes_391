  "test_question": "Q: A watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons. Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found out that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so she took them home.

  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Jeremy buys 30 watermelons. He eats 3 watermelons per week. Each week he gives 2 to his dad. How many weeks will the watermelons last?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many watermelons Jeremy eats per week and how many he gives to his dad. Jeremy eats 3 watermelons per week and gives 2 to his dad, so he uses a total of 5 watermelons per week. Next, we need to divide the total number of watermelons by the number of watermelons used per week to find out how many weeks the watermelons will last. 30 watermelons \u00f7 5 watermelons per week = 6 weeks Therefore, the watermelons will last for 6 weeks. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of 18 watermelons. Since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, the total weight of 18 watermelons would be: 23 x 18 = 414 pounds Next, we need to find the total amount of money Farmer Kent would make by selling these watermelons. Since he sells them for $2 a pound, we can multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 414 x $2 = $828 Therefore, Farmer Kent would make $828 for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: A tomato plant has 100 tomatoes. Jane picks 1/4 of that number for use in their house. After a week, she goes back and picks 20 more tomatoes, and the following week picks twice that number. What's the total number of fruits remaining on the tomato plant?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Jane picks 1/4 of 100 tomatoes, which is 25 tomatoes. So, there are 100 - 25 = 75 tomatoes left on the plant. After a week, Jane picks 20 more tomatoes, so there are 75 - 20 = 55 tomatoes left on the plant. The following week, Jane picks twice the number of tomatoes she picked the previous week, which is 2 * 20 = 40 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes Jane picked is 25 + 20 + 40 = 85 tomatoes. The total number of tomatoes remaining on the plant is 100 - 85 = 15 tomatoes. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Brenda picks 250 peaches. When she sorts through them, only 60% are fresh, and Brenda has to throw 15 away for being too small. How many peaches does Brenda have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many peaches are fresh. We can do this by multiplying the total number of peaches by the percentage that are fresh: 250 x 0.6 = 150 So Brenda has 150 fresh peaches. Next, we need to subtract the 15 peaches that she threw away: 150 - 15 = 135 Therefore, Brenda has 135 peaches left after sorting through them. The answer is 135.\n\n\nQ: Colby harvested his mango trees, the total mangoes he harvested is 60 kilograms. He sold 20 kilograms to the market and sold the remaining half to his community. If each kilogram contains 8 mangoes, how many mangoes does he still have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many kilograms of mangoes Colby sold to his community. We know that he sold 20 kilograms to the market, so he had 60 - 20 = 40 kilograms left. Next, we need to find out how many kilograms of mangoes he sold to his community. We know that he sold half of the remaining 40 kilograms, which is 40/2 = 20 kilograms. Finally, we need to find out how many mangoes he still has. We know that each kilogram contains 8 mangoes, so he sold a total of 20 + 20 = 40 kilograms, which is equivalent to 40 x 8 = 320 mangoes. Therefore, Colby still has 60 - 40 = 20 kilograms of mangoes, which is equivalent to 20 x 8 = 160 mangoes. The answer is 160.\n\n\nQ: An apple tree produces 40 apples in its first year.  The second year the apple tree produces 8 more than double the amount of apples that it produced the first year, and the third year production went down by a fourth due to an insect infestation.  How many apples did the tree produce in total in the first three years?\nA: Let's think step by step. First year: 40 apples Second year: 8 more than double the amount of apples produced in the first year Double the amount of apples produced in the first year: 40 x 2 = 80 apples 8 more than double the amount of apples produced in the first year: 80 + 8 = 88 apples Third year: production went down by a fourth due to an insect infestation One fourth of the second year's production: 88 / 4 = 22 apples Third year's production: 88 - 22 = 66 apples Total production in the first three years: 40 + 88 + 66 = 194 apples. Therefore, the apple tree produced 194 apples in total in the first three years. The answer is 194.\n\n\nQ: Vicente saw Sophie's mom giving Sophie 20 oranges every day to carry to school to eat. He also saw Hannah's dad giving Hannah 40 grapes every day to eat at the school. If he counted the number of fruits that the girls were given for 30 days, calculate the total number of fruits that Sophie and Hannah had eaten in the 30 days.\nA: Let's think step by step. Sophie was given 20 oranges every day for 30 days, so the total number of oranges she received is: 20 oranges/day x 30 days = 600 oranges Similarly, Hannah was given 40 grapes every day for 30 days, so the total number of grapes she received is: 40 grapes/day x 30 days = 1200 grapes Therefore, the total number of fruits that Sophie and Hannah had eaten in the 30 days is: 600 oranges + 1200 grapes = 1800 fruits The answer is 1800.\n\n\nQ: Tania has five baskets containing a total of 58 fruits. There are 18 mangoes in one basket, 10 pears in another, 12 pawpaws in another and the last 2 contain the same number of kiwi and lemon respectively, how many lemons are there?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of fruits in the three baskets that are not kiwi or lemon. 18 + 10 + 12 = 40 So, there are 40 fruits in those three baskets. Next, we need to find the total number of fruits in all five baskets. If there are 58 fruits in total, and 40 of them are in the three baskets we just added up, then the remaining two baskets must contain: 58 - 40 = 18 fruits We know that one of those baskets contains kiwi and the other contains lemon, and they have the same number of fruits. So, we can divide the remaining 18 fruits by 2 to get: 18 / 2 = 9 Therefore, there are 9 lemons in the basket with lemon. The answer is 9.\n\n\n"
