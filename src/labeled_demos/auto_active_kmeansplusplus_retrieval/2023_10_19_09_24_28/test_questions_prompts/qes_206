  "test_question": "Q: A food truck only sells grilled cheeses.  They source their bread for $3.00 a loaf and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.  They spend $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments per 10 sandwiches.  If they sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, what is their net profit?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: At Penny\u2019s bakery, her famous blueberry cheesecakes are $7 a slice.  Each cheesecake pie is cut into 6 thick slices.  If she sells 7 cheesecake pies, how much money does she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of cheesecake Penny has in total. Since each cheesecake pie is cut into 6 slices, we can multiply 6 by the number of cheesecake pies she sold: 6 slices/pie x 7 pies = 42 slices So Penny sold 42 slices of blueberry cheesecake. Next, we need to find out how much money she made from selling those 42 slices. Each slice costs $7, so we can multiply 7 by the number of slices: $7/slice x 42 slices = $294 Therefore, Penny made $294 from selling 7 cheesecake pies. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Five people are planning a party. Sonja will buy a loaf of French bread ($3 a loaf) and a platter of cold cuts ($23). Barbara will buy the soda ($1 per person) and two boxes of crackers ($2 per box). Mario and Rick will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles ($3 per package). Danica will supply a package of paper plates for $4. How much more will Sonja spend than the rest of the office put together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of Barbara's contribution. She will buy soda for 5 people, which will cost $5 (1 dollar per person). She will also buy two boxes of crackers, which will cost $4 (2 dollars per box). Therefore, Barbara's total contribution will be $9. Next, let's calculate the total cost of Mario and Rick's contribution. They will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles, which will cost $6 in total (3 dollars per package). Now, let's add up the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's. Barbara's contribution is $9, Mario and Rick's contribution is $6, and Danica's contribution is $4. Therefore, the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's is $19. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of Sonja's contribution. She will buy a loaf of French bread for $3 and a platter of cold cuts for $23. Therefore, Sonja's total contribution will be $26. To find out how much more Sonja will spend than the rest of the office put together, we need to subtract the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's from Sonja's total contribution. $26 (Sonja's contribution) - $19 (total cost of everyone else's contribution) = $7 Therefore, Sonja will spend $7 more than the rest of the office put together. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: A teacher is making packed lunches for a field trip. Each student needs 2 sandwiches, and will travel in a group with 5 other students. There are a total of 5 groups. How many pieces of bread will the teacher need to make enough sandwiches for all the students?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of students going on the field trip. Since each group has 6 students (1 student + 5 others), and there are 5 groups, the total number of students is: 6 students/group x 5 groups = 30 students Step 2: Find the total number of sandwiches needed. Since each student needs 2 sandwiches, the total number of sandwiches needed is: 2 sandwiches/student x 30 students = 60 sandwiches Step 3: Find the total number of bread slices needed. Since each sandwich has 2 slices of bread, the total number of bread slices needed is: 2 slices/sandwich x 60 sandwiches = 120 slices of bread Therefore, the teacher will need 120 slices of bread to make enough sandwiches for all the students. The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: Ice cream costs $2.00 and toppings cost $0.50 per topping. How much does a sundae with 10 toppings cost?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the ice cream, which is $2.00. Next, we need to calculate the cost of the toppings. Since each topping costs $0.50 and there are 10 toppings, we can multiply $0.50 by 10 to get the total cost of the toppings: $0.50 x 10 = $5.00 Finally, we can add the cost of the ice cream and the toppings together to get the total cost of the sundae: $2.00 + $5.00 = $7.00 Therefore, a sundae with 10 toppings would cost $7.00. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: A factory decides to stop making cars and start making motorcycles instead. When it made cars, per month, it cost $100 for materials, they could make 4 cars, and they sold each car for $50. Now that they make motorcycles it costs $250 for materials, but they sell 8 of them for $50 each. How much more profit do they make per month selling motorcycles instead of cars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the profit made per car: Revenue per car = $50 Cost per car = $100/4 = $25 Profit per car = Revenue per car - Cost per car = $50 - $25 = $25 Now, let's calculate the profit made per motorcycle: Revenue per motorcycle = $50 x 8 = $400 Cost per motorcycle = $250 Profit per motorcycle = Revenue per motorcycle - Cost per motorcycle = $400 - $250 = $150 Finally, let's calculate the difference in profit between making cars and making motorcycles: Profit difference = Profit per motorcycle - Profit per car = $150 - $25 = $125 Therefore, the factory makes $125 more profit per month by making motorcycles instead of cars. The answer is 125.\n\n\nQ: Sean designs and sells patches.  He orders his patches in a unit of 100 and is charged $1.25 per patch.  If he turns around and sells all 100 patches for $12.00 each, what is his net profit?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of 100 patches for Sean. Cost of 100 patches = 100 x $1.25 = $125 Next, we need to calculate the revenue generated by selling 100 patches at $12.00 each. Revenue from 100 patches = 100 x $12.00 = $1200 Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the cost from the revenue. Net profit = Revenue - Cost = $1200 - $125 = $1075 Therefore, Sean's net profit is $1075. The answer is 1075.\n\n\nQ: Brenda volunteered to make 3 trays of banana pudding for the family reunion.  Each tray of banana pudding would need 80 wafer cookies.  A box of wafer cookies only had 60 cookies per box.  Each box costs $3.50.  How much will it cost her to buy just enough boxes for 3 trays of banana pudding?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many wafer cookies Brenda needs in total. She needs 80 cookies per tray and she's making 3 trays, so she needs: 80 x 3 = 240 wafer cookies Next, we need to figure out how many boxes of cookies she needs to buy. Each box has 60 cookies, so we can divide the total number of cookies needed by the number of cookies per box: 240 \u00f7 60 = 4 boxes So Brenda needs to buy 4 boxes of cookies. Each box costs $3.50, so we can multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box: 4 x $3.50 = $14 Therefore, it will cost Brenda $14 to buy just enough boxes for 3 trays of banana pudding. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: A pie shop charges $5 for a slice of pie. They cut each whole pie into 4 slices. How much money will the pie shop make if they sell 9 pies?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of pie are in 9 whole pies. Since each pie is cut into 4 slices, we can multiply 9 by 4 to get the total number of slices: 9 x 4 = 36 So there are 36 slices of pie in 9 whole pies. Next, we need to find out how much money the pie shop will make if they sell all 36 slices. Each slice costs $5, so we can multiply 36 by 5 to get the total amount of money: 36 x 5 = 180 Therefore, the pie shop will make $180 if they sell 9 whole pies, each cut into 4 slices, at $5 per slice. The answer is 5.\n\n\n"
