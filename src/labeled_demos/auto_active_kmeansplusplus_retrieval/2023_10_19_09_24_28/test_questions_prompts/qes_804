  "test_question": "Q: James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a 20-mile lake.  He can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour.  He swims 60% of the distance.  After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed.  How long did it take him to get across the lake?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Jeff was driving to the capital city to attend a conference. At first, he was driving at 80 miles/hour for about 6 hours, then the speed limit changed and he had to slow down to 60 miles/hour, and so he drove at this speed for 4 hours. Then he made a stop at a gas station. Once the car was full of gas, he drove at 40 miles/hour the rest of the trip for 2 hours. How many miles did he travel?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how far Jeff traveled at 80 miles/hour for 6 hours. We can use the formula distance = speed x time. distance = 80 miles/hour x 6 hours = 480 miles Next, we need to find out how far Jeff traveled at 60 miles/hour for 4 hours. distance = 60 miles/hour x 4 hours = 240 miles Then, we need to find out how far Jeff traveled at 40 miles/hour for 2 hours. distance = 40 miles/hour x 2 hours = 80 miles Finally, we can add up all the distances to find the total distance Jeff traveled. total distance = 480 miles + 240 miles + 80 miles = 800 miles Therefore, Jeff traveled 800 miles to attend the conference. The answer is 800.\n\n\nQ: Yvonne swims 10 laps in 5 minutes.  Her younger sister can swim half as many laps as Yvonne in the same time frame.  Their brother Joel can swim three times the number of laps as the youngest sister.  How many laps can Joel swim?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many laps Yvonne's younger sister can swim in 5 minutes. Since she can swim half as many laps as Yvonne, we can divide Yvonne's number of laps by 2: Yvonne's sister = 10 laps / 2 = 5 laps Next, we need to figure out how many laps Joel can swim. We know that he can swim three times the number of laps as the youngest sister, so we can multiply her number of laps by 3: Joel = 5 laps * 3 = 15 laps Therefore, Joel can swim 15 laps in 5 minutes. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Stuart is going on a cross-country trip and wants to find the fastest route. On one route the total distance is 1500 miles and the average speed is 75 MPH. On the second trip, the total distance is 750 but the average speed is 25 MPH. How long does his trip take if he goes on the fastest route?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for Stuart to complete the first route. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed So for the first route, the time would be: time = 1500 / 75 time = 20 hours Next, we need to find the time it takes for Stuart to complete the second route: time = 750 / 25 time = 30 hours Now we know that the second route takes longer than the first route. So the fastest route would be the first route, which takes 20 hours. Therefore, if Stuart goes on the fastest route, his trip will take 20 hours. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: A train takes 4 hours to reach a destination at a speed of 50 miles per hour. How long would it take if it traveled at 100 miles per hour instead?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time We know that the distance is the same in both scenarios, so we can set the two equations equal to each other: 50 miles/hour x 4 hours = 100 miles/hour x time Simplifying this equation, we get: 200 miles = 100 miles/hour x time Dividing both sides by 100 miles/hour, we get: time = 2 hours Therefore, if the train traveled at 100 miles per hour instead of 50 miles per hour, it would take 2 hours to reach the destination. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Richard starts walking from Cincinnati to New York City, which is 70 miles. Richards walks 20 miles the first day. The next day he walks 6 miles less than half as much as he walked the first day. He walks 10 miles the third day. How many miles further does Richard have to walk to be in New York City?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Richard walks 20 miles. On the second day, he walks 6 miles less than half as much as he walked the first day. Half of what he walked on the first day is 20/2 = 10 miles. So, he walks 10 - 6 = 4 miles on the second day. On the third day, he walks 10 miles. Therefore, the total distance Richard has walked so far is 20 + 4 + 10 = 34 miles. To reach New York City, which is 70 miles away, Richard still has to walk 70 - 34 = 36 miles further. The answer is 36.\n\n\nQ: Micah, Dean, and Jake are all training for a marathon organized by a local NGO to support children in their town who have cancer. Micah runs 2/3 times as fast as Dean. It takes Jake 1/3 times more time to finish the marathon than it takes Mica. If Dean takes 9 hours, what's the total time the three take to complete the marathon?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Micah to finish the marathon since we know that he runs 2/3 times as fast as Dean. If Dean takes 9 hours, then Micah takes 2/3 * 9 = 6 hours to finish the marathon. Next, we need to find out how long it takes Jake to finish the marathon since we know that it takes him 1/3 times more time than Micah. If Micah takes 6 hours, then Jake takes 6 + (1/3 * 6) = 8 hours to finish the marathon. Finally, we can add up the times it takes each person to finish the marathon to get the total time. So, the total time the three take to complete the marathon is 9 + 6 + 8 = 23 hours. The answer is 23.\n\n\nQ: Mr. Maxwell takes 1 hr to drive to work in the morning but 1 and half hours to drive back home in the evening. If the morning and evening traffic is similar and he drives at an average speed of 30mph in the morning, what is the average speed of his return journey?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time Since Mr. Maxwell drives at an average speed of 30mph in the morning and takes 1 hour to drive to work, we can calculate the distance he travels in the morning as: distance = 30 x 1 = 30 miles Now, we know that the distance he travels in the evening is the same as the distance he travels in the morning (assuming he takes the same route). So, we can use the formula again to find his average speed in the evening: speed = distance / time We know the distance is 30 miles, but we need to find the time it takes him to drive back home. We're told that it takes him 1 and a half hours, which we can also write as 1.5 hours. Therefore, his average speed in the evening is: speed = 30 / 1.5 = 20 mph So, the average speed of his return journey is 20 mph. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: A car driving cross-country traveled 180 miles in 4 hours. At this rate of speed, how many miles further will the car travel in the next 3 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the car's speed in miles per hour (mph). To do this, we divide the distance traveled by the time taken: Speed = Distance \u00f7 Time Speed = 180 miles \u00f7 4 hours Speed = 45 mph Now that we know the car's speed, we can use it to calculate how far it will travel in the next 3 hours: Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time Distance = 45 mph \u00d7 3 hours Distance = 135 miles Therefore, the car will travel 135 miles further in the next 3 hours. The answer is 3.\n\n\n"
