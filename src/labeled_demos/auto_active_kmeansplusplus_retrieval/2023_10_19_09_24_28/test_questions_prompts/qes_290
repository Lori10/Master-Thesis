  "test_question": "Q: A three-toed sloth moves very slowly, and only eats when he is up in his tree.  For a meal of berries, it takes the sloth 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up into his tree.  Assuming he picks the same number of berries on each trip, what is the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground if he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Brandon can catch 6 squirrels or two rabbits in 1 hour. Each squirrel has 300 calories and each rabbit has 800 calories. How many more calories will he get per hour if he catches squirrels instead of rabbits?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many calories Brandon can get from catching squirrels in one hour. We know that each squirrel has 300 calories, and he can catch 6 squirrels in one hour. So, the total number of calories he can get from catching squirrels in one hour is: 300 calories/squirrel x 6 squirrels = 1800 calories Next, we need to find out how many calories Brandon can get from catching rabbits in one hour. We know that each rabbit has 800 calories, and he can catch 2 rabbits in one hour. So, the total number of calories he can get from catching rabbits in one hour is: 800 calories/rabbit x 2 rabbits = 1600 calories Finally, we need to find out how many more calories Brandon will get per hour if he catches squirrels instead of rabbits. We can do this by subtracting the number of calories he can get from catching rabbits from the number of calories he can get from catching squirrels: 1800 calories - 1600 calories = 200 calories Therefore, Brandon will get 200 more calories per hour if he catches squirrels instead of rabbits. The answer is 200.\n\n\nQ: Susan is picking strawberries. She's trying to fill her basket, but out of every handful of 5 strawberries she can't help but eat one of them herself. If her basket holds 60 strawberries, how many berries will she actually pick before she fills it?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many strawberries Susan will pick in each handful. If she eats one out of every five, that means she will pick four out of every five. So, for every handful of 5 strawberries, she will pick 4. Next, we need to figure out how many handfuls of strawberries Susan will need to pick to fill her basket. If her basket holds 60 strawberries, and she picks 4 strawberries per handful, then she will need to pick 60/4 = 15 handfuls of strawberries. Finally, we need to figure out how many strawberries she will actually pick before she fills her basket. Since she eats one out of every five strawberries, that means she will eat 1/5 of the strawberries she picks. So, for every 5 strawberries she picks, she will eat one and keep four. Therefore, she will actually pick 15 x 5 = 75 strawberries before she fills her basket. The answer is 75.\n\n\nQ: A snail kite is a kind of bird that eats apple snails. On the first day, a snail kite ate 3 snails. Then it eats 2 more snails than it did the day before. How many apple snails in all did a snail kite eat for 5 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, the snail kite ate 3 snails. On the second day, it ate 2 more snails than the day before, so it ate 3 + 2 = 5 snails. On the third day, it ate 2 more snails than the day before, so it ate 5 + 2 = 7 snails. On the fourth day, it ate 2 more snails than the day before, so it ate 7 + 2 = 9 snails. On the fifth day, it ate 2 more snails than the day before, so it ate 9 + 2 = 11 snails. To find the total number of snails the snail kite ate for 5 days, we add up the number of snails it ate each day: 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 35. Therefore, the snail kite ate 35 apple snails in all for 5 days. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Vicente saw Sophie's mom giving Sophie 20 oranges every day to carry to school to eat. He also saw Hannah's dad giving Hannah 40 grapes every day to eat at the school. If he counted the number of fruits that the girls were given for 30 days, calculate the total number of fruits that Sophie and Hannah had eaten in the 30 days.\nA: Let's think step by step. Sophie was given 20 oranges every day for 30 days, so the total number of oranges she received is: 20 oranges/day x 30 days = 600 oranges Similarly, Hannah was given 40 grapes every day for 30 days, so the total number of grapes she received is: 40 grapes/day x 30 days = 1200 grapes Therefore, the total number of fruits that Sophie and Hannah had eaten in the 30 days is: 600 oranges + 1200 grapes = 1800 fruits The answer is 1800.\n\n\nQ: Herman likes to feed the birds in December, January and February.  He feeds them 1/2 cup in the morning and 1/2 cup in the afternoon.  How many cups of food will he need for all three months?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days there are in December, January, and February. December has 31 days, January has 31 days, and February has 28 days (or 29 in a leap year). Next, we need to find out how many times Herman feeds the birds in a day. He feeds them 1/2 cup in the morning and 1/2 cup in the afternoon, so he feeds them a total of 1 cup per day. Now we can calculate how much food he needs for all three months. In one month, he feeds the birds for 31 days, so he needs 31 cups of food (1 cup per day). For all three months, he needs 31 cups x 3 months = 93 cups of food. The answer is 93.\n\n\nQ: A total of 107 oranges are picked by Del and Juan. Del picked 23 on each of 2 days and Juan picked the rest. How many oranges did Juan pick?\nA: Let's think step by step. Del picked 23 oranges on each of 2 days, so he picked a total of 23 x 2 = 46 oranges. If the total number of oranges picked by both Del and Juan is 107, then Juan picked 107 - 46 = 61 oranges. Therefore, Juan picked 61 oranges. The answer is 61.\n\n\nQ: There are four growing trees. The first tree grows 1 meter/day, the second grows the same amount in half the time, the third grows 2 meters/day, and the fourth tree grows a meter more than the third each day. How many meters did the trees grow in total in 4 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much the second tree grows per day. Since it grows the same amount as the first tree in half the time, it grows 2 meters/day. Now we can calculate how much each tree grows in 4 days: - The first tree grows 1 meter/day, so in 4 days it grows 4 meters. - The second tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The third tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The fourth tree grows 1 meter more than the third each day, so it grows 3 meters/day. In 4 days it grows 12 meters. Adding up the growth of all four trees, we get: 4 + 8 + 8 + 12 = 32 meters Therefore, the trees grew a total of 32 meters in 4 days. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Last night Kannon had 3 apples, a banana, and 4 oranges for dinner. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, and twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today. How many fruits would she have eaten so far in the two meals?\nA: Let's think step by step. Last night Kannon had 3 apples, 1 banana, and 4 oranges, so she had a total of 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 fruits. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, which means she will have 3 + 4 = 7 apples today. She is also planning to have 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, which means she will have 1 x 10 = 10 bananas today. Finally, she is planning to have twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today, which means she will have 7 x 2 = 14 oranges today. Therefore, in total, Kannon will have eaten 7 + 10 + 14 = 31 fruits in the two meals. The answer is 31.\n\n\n"
