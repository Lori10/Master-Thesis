  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Ron is part of a book club that allows each member to take a turn picking a new book every week. The club is made up of three couples and five single people along with Ron and his wife. How many times a year does Ron get to pick a new book?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of people in the book club. There are three couples, which means six people. There are also five single people. Adding Ron and his wife, we get: 6 (couples) + 5 (singles) + 2 (Ron and his wife) = 13 people in the book club Since each member gets to pick a new book every week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, we can calculate the number of times Ron gets to pick a new book: Ron gets to pick a new book once every 13 weeks (since there are 13 people in the club) 52 weeks in a year \u00f7 13 weeks per pick = 4 times a year Therefore, Ron gets to pick a new book 4 times a year. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Grant spends $200.00 a year to have the newspaper delivered daily to his house.  Juanita buys the newspaper daily.  Monday through Saturday, she spends $0.50 and on Sunday she spends $2.00.  How much more money does Juanita spend buying the newspaper yearly than Grant?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper daily from Monday to Saturday: $0.50 x 6 = $3.00 Now, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper on Sundays: $2.00 x 1 = $2.00 Next, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper weekly: $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00 Finally, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper yearly: $5.00 x 52 = $260.00 Now, let's calculate the difference between what Juanita spends and what Grant spends: $260.00 - $200.00 = $60.00 Therefore, Juanita spends $60.00 more buying the newspaper yearly than Grant. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Betty has 20 books, and her sister has 1/4 times more books than Betty. What's the total number of books the two have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many books Betty's sister has. To do this, we can take 1/4 of Betty's number of books and add it to Betty's number of books. 1/4 of 20 books is (1/4) x 20 = 5 books. So Betty's sister has 20 + 5 = 25 books. To find the total number of books the two have, we can add Betty's number of books to her sister's number of books: 20 + 25 = 45 books. Therefore, the two sisters have a total of 45 books. The answer is 45.\n\n\nQ: Gina chooses what she and her sister will watch on Netflix three times as often as her sister does. If her sister watches a total of 24 shows on Netflix per week, and each show is 50 minutes long, how many minutes of Netflix does Gina get to choose?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how often Gina chooses what they watch compared to her sister. We know that Gina chooses three times as often as her sister, so if her sister watches 24 shows per week, Gina chooses what they watch 3 times that amount, or 3 x 24 = 72 times per week. Next, we need to figure out how many minutes of Netflix each person gets to choose. We know that each show is 50 minutes long, so if Gina chooses 72 shows per week, she gets to choose 72 x 50 = 3600 minutes of Netflix per week. Therefore, Gina gets to choose 3600 minutes of Netflix per week. The answer is 3600.\n\n\nQ: Mary has 26 blue shirts and 36 brown shirts. If she gives away half of her blue shirts and a third of her brown shirts, how many shirts does she have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many blue shirts Mary gives away. Half of her blue shirts would be: 26 / 2 = 13 So Mary gives away 13 blue shirts. Next, we need to find out how many brown shirts Mary gives away. A third of her brown shirts would be: 36 / 3 = 12 So Mary gives away 12 brown shirts. Now we can find out how many shirts Mary has left. She started with 26 blue shirts and gave away 13, so she has: 26 - 13 = 13 blue shirts left She started with 36 brown shirts and gave away 12, so she has: 36 - 12 = 24 brown shirts left Therefore, Mary has 13 + 24 = 37 shirts left. The answer is 37.\n\n\nQ: James writes a comic every other day for 4 years. If there was no leap year, how many comics has he written?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days there are in 4 years. Since there are 365 days in a year, we can multiply 365 by 4 to get: 365 x 4 = 1460 days Next, we need to figure out how many comics James writes in every other day. Since he writes a comic every other day, we can divide the total number of days by 2 to get: 1460 / 2 = 730 comics Therefore, James has written 730 comics in 4 years if there was no leap year. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Stacy bought two packs of printer paper for the office. Each pack has 240 sheets of paper. Her office prints 80 one-page documents per day. How many days will the printer paper last her office?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many sheets of paper Stacy bought in total. Since she bought two packs, each with 240 sheets, we can multiply 2 by 240 to get: 2 x 240 = 480 So Stacy bought 480 sheets of paper in total. Next, we need to figure out how many pages her office prints per day. We know they print 80 one-page documents per day, so that means they print: 80 x 1 = 80 pages per day Now we can use this information to figure out how many days the paper will last. We can divide the total number of sheets by the number of pages printed per day: 480 / 80 = 6 So the printer paper will last Stacy's office 6 days. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Alyssa took 100 photos on vacation. She wants to put them in a photo album with 30 pages. She can place 3 photos each on the first 10 pages. Then she can place 4 photos each on the next 10 pages. If she wants to put an equal number of photos on each of the remaining pages of the album, how many photos can she place on each page?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Alyssa can place 3 photos each on the first 10 pages, which means she has used 3 x 10 = 30 photos. Then, she can place 4 photos each on the next 10 pages, which means she has used 4 x 10 = 40 photos. So far, she has used 30 + 40 = 70 photos. She has 100 - 70 = 30 photos left to place in the remaining pages. Since she wants to put an equal number of photos on each of the remaining pages, she can divide the remaining photos by the number of remaining pages: 30 \u00f7 10 = 3. Therefore, Alyssa can place 3 photos on each of the remaining 10 pages. The answer is 10.\n\n\n"
