  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Ann can skate 6 miles an hour. Her friend Glenda can skate 8 miles an hour. If they start in the same place and skate in straight lines in opposite directions for 3 hours, how many miles apart do they end up?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how far Ann and Glenda each skate in 3 hours. Ann: 6 miles/hour x 3 hours = 18 miles Glenda: 8 miles/hour x 3 hours = 24 miles Step 2: Add the distances they each skated to find the total distance between them. 18 miles + 24 miles = 42 miles Therefore, Ann and Glenda end up 42 miles apart after skating in opposite directions for 3 hours. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Richard starts walking from Cincinnati to New York City, which is 70 miles. Richards walks 20 miles the first day. The next day he walks 6 miles less than half as much as he walked the first day. He walks 10 miles the third day. How many miles further does Richard have to walk to be in New York City?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Richard walks 20 miles. On the second day, he walks 6 miles less than half as much as he walked the first day. Half of what he walked on the first day is 20/2 = 10 miles. So, he walks 10 - 6 = 4 miles on the second day. On the third day, he walks 10 miles. Therefore, the total distance Richard has walked so far is 20 + 4 + 10 = 34 miles. To reach New York City, which is 70 miles away, Richard still has to walk 70 - 34 = 36 miles further. The answer is 36.\n\n\nQ: A car driving cross-country traveled 180 miles in 4 hours. At this rate of speed, how many miles further will the car travel in the next 3 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the car's speed in miles per hour (mph). To do this, we divide the distance traveled by the time taken: Speed = Distance \u00f7 Time Speed = 180 miles \u00f7 4 hours Speed = 45 mph Now that we know the car's speed, we can use it to calculate how far it will travel in the next 3 hours: Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time Distance = 45 mph \u00d7 3 hours Distance = 135 miles Therefore, the car will travel 135 miles further in the next 3 hours. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Mr. Maxwell takes 1 hr to drive to work in the morning but 1 and half hours to drive back home in the evening. If the morning and evening traffic is similar and he drives at an average speed of 30mph in the morning, what is the average speed of his return journey?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time Since Mr. Maxwell drives at an average speed of 30mph in the morning and takes 1 hour to drive to work, we can calculate the distance he travels in the morning as: distance = 30 x 1 = 30 miles Now, we know that the distance he travels in the evening is the same as the distance he travels in the morning (assuming he takes the same route). So, we can use the formula again to find his average speed in the evening: speed = distance / time We know the distance is 30 miles, but we need to find the time it takes him to drive back home. We're told that it takes him 1 and a half hours, which we can also write as 1.5 hours. Therefore, his average speed in the evening is: speed = 30 / 1.5 = 20 mph So, the average speed of his return journey is 20 mph. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Colin ran his first mile in 6 minutes.  He ran his next two miles in 5 minutes each and finished his 4th mile in 4 minutes.  What was the average time it took him to run a mile?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total time it took Colin to run all four miles. - Colin's first mile took 6 minutes. - His next two miles took 5 minutes each, so that's a total of 10 minutes. - His fourth mile took 4 minutes. To find the total time, we add these up: 6 + 10 + 4 = 20 So Colin ran four miles in a total of 20 minutes. To find the average time it took him to run a mile, we divide the total time by the number of miles: 20 / 4 = 5 So Colin's average time to run a mile was 5 minutes. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Two old ladies spent the afternoon walking through Central Park.  The first lady walked twice as far as the second lady.  If the second lady walked four miles, what is the combined total distance, in miles, the two ladies walked?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the second lady walked 4 miles. Next, we know that the first lady walked twice as far as the second lady. So, we can multiply the second lady's distance by 2 to find the first lady's distance: 4 miles x 2 = 8 miles Therefore, the combined total distance the two ladies walked is: 4 miles + 8 miles = 12 miles The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: Micah, Dean, and Jake are all training for a marathon organized by a local NGO to support children in their town who have cancer. Micah runs 2/3 times as fast as Dean. It takes Jake 1/3 times more time to finish the marathon than it takes Mica. If Dean takes 9 hours, what's the total time the three take to complete the marathon?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Micah to finish the marathon since we know that he runs 2/3 times as fast as Dean. If Dean takes 9 hours, then Micah takes 2/3 * 9 = 6 hours to finish the marathon. Next, we need to find out how long it takes Jake to finish the marathon since we know that it takes him 1/3 times more time than Micah. If Micah takes 6 hours, then Jake takes 6 + (1/3 * 6) = 8 hours to finish the marathon. Finally, we can add up the times it takes each person to finish the marathon to get the total time. So, the total time the three take to complete the marathon is 9 + 6 + 8 = 23 hours. The answer is 23.\n\n\nQ: Yvonne swims 10 laps in 5 minutes.  Her younger sister can swim half as many laps as Yvonne in the same time frame.  Their brother Joel can swim three times the number of laps as the youngest sister.  How many laps can Joel swim?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many laps Yvonne's younger sister can swim in 5 minutes. Since she can swim half as many laps as Yvonne, we can divide Yvonne's number of laps by 2: Yvonne's sister = 10 laps / 2 = 5 laps Next, we need to figure out how many laps Joel can swim. We know that he can swim three times the number of laps as the youngest sister, so we can multiply her number of laps by 3: Joel = 5 laps * 3 = 15 laps Therefore, Joel can swim 15 laps in 5 minutes. The answer is 5.\n\n\n"
