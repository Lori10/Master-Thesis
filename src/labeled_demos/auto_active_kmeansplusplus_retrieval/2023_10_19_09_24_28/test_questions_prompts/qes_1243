  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Mary wants 144 cupcakes for her party. Mary has already made 36 cherry cupcakes, and 48 berry cupcakes. Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes for the rest. How much of each should she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Mary has already made: 36 cherry + 48 berry = 84 cupcakes Next, we need to figure out how many more cupcakes Mary needs to make: 144 total cupcakes - 84 cupcakes already made = 60 cupcakes Since Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, we can divide the remaining 60 cupcakes by 2: 60 cupcakes \u00f7 2 = 30 cupcakes of each flavor Therefore, Mary should make 30 chocolate cupcakes and 30 vanilla cupcakes to have a total of 144 cupcakes for her party. The answer is 144.\n\n\nQ: A vampire needs to suck 7 gallons of blood per week to survive.  If he sucks 2 pints of blood per person, how many people does he need to suck each day to survive?\nA: Let's think step by step. 1 gallon = 8 pints (since 1 gallon = 128 fluid ounces and 1 fluid ounce = 0.125 pints) So, 7 gallons = 7 x 8 = 56 pints The vampire needs to suck 56 pints of blood per week to survive. 2 pints of blood per person To find out how many people the vampire needs to suck each day, we need to divide 56 by the number of days in a week (7). 56/7 = 8 Therefore, the vampire needs to suck blood from 8 people each day to survive. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Marie, the confectioner, makes 12 chocolate eggs, each weighing 10 ounces. She then packs an equal number of the eggs in 4 different gift boxes. Unfortunately, she leaves one of the boxes by the kitchen window and the afternoon sun melts everything. She tosses that box out. What is the total weight, in ounces, of the remaining chocolate eggs?\nA: Let's think step by step. Marie makes 12 chocolate eggs, each weighing 10 ounces. So the total weight of all the eggs is: 12 x 10 = 120 ounces Marie packs an equal number of eggs in 4 different gift boxes. So each box contains: 120 / 4 = 30 ounces But one of the boxes is tossed out, so we need to subtract the weight of that box from the total weight of the eggs. Therefore, the total weight of the remaining chocolate eggs is: (3 boxes) x (30 ounces per box) = 90 ounces The answer is 90.\n\n\nQ: Ethan makes beeswax candles.  For each candle, he uses 8 ounces of beeswax and 1 ounce of coconut oil.  If he makes three less than 10 candles, what will be the combined weight of the candles in ounces?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many candles Ethan makes. We know that he makes three less than 10 candles, so: 10 - 3 = 7 candles Next, we need to find out how much beeswax and coconut oil Ethan uses for each candle. We know that he uses 8 ounces of beeswax and 1 ounce of coconut oil for each candle, so: 8 + 1 = 9 ounces per candle Now we can find out the total weight of all the candles by multiplying the number of candles by the weight of each candle: 7 x 9 = 63 ounces Therefore, the combined weight of the candles in ounces will be 63 ounces. The answer is 63.\n\n\nQ: Harry uses a whole bag of chocolate chips when he makes dough for chocolate chip cookies. The dough makes three batches of cookies, and each cookie has nine chocolate chips in it. A bag of chocolate chips has 81 chips in it. How many cookies are in a batch?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Harry uses a whole bag of chocolate chips for three batches of cookies. So, we can divide the number of chips in a bag by 3 to find out how many chips are in each batch: 81 chips / 3 batches = 27 chips per batch Next, we know that each cookie has 9 chocolate chips in it. So, we can divide the number of chips per batch by 9 to find out how many cookies are in each batch: 27 chips per batch / 9 chips per cookie = 3 cookies per batch Therefore, there are 3 cookies in each batch. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: 1 chocolate bar costs $1.50 and can be broken into 3 sections to make 3 s'mores.  Ron is hosting a boy scout camp out in his backyard for 15 scouts.  He wants to make sure that there are enough chocolate bars for everyone to have 2 s'mores each.  How much will he spend on chocolate bars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how many s'mores Ron needs to make in total. Since there are 15 scouts and each scout needs 2 s'mores, Ron needs to make 15 x 2 = 30 s'mores in total. Next, we need to calculate how many chocolate bars Ron needs to buy. Since each chocolate bar can make 3 s'mores, Ron needs to buy 30/3 = 10 chocolate bars. Finally, we need to calculate how much Ron will spend on chocolate bars. Since each chocolate bar costs $1.50, Ron will spend 10 x $1.50 = $15 on chocolate bars. Therefore, Ron will spend $15 on chocolate bars to make sure that there are enough for everyone to have 2 s'mores each. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: MIlle is making snack packs for her kindergarten class. She's going to divide 64 pretzels, four times as many goldfish, and 32 suckers into baggies for the 16 kids in the class. How many items does each baggie have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many goldfish there are. We know that there are four times as many goldfish as pretzels, so: 64 pretzels x 4 = 256 goldfish Next, we need to add up the total number of items: 64 pretzels + 256 goldfish + 32 suckers = 352 items Now we can divide the total number of items by the number of baggies: 352 items \u00f7 16 baggies = 22 items per baggie Therefore, each baggie will have 22 items, which includes pretzels, goldfish, and suckers. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Jack makes his own cold brew coffee.  He makes it in batches of 1.5 gallons.  He drinks 96 ounces of coffee every 2 days.  It takes 20 hours to make coffee.  How long does he spend making coffee over 24 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 1.5 gallons to ounces. There are 128 ounces in a gallon, so 1.5 gallons is 1.5 x 128 = 192 ounces. Next, we need to figure out how many ounces of coffee Jack makes in one batch. Since he makes 192 ounces of cold brew coffee in one batch, that's how much he has to drink over the course of 2 days. Therefore, he drinks 192/2 = 96 ounces of coffee every 2 days. Now we need to figure out how many batches of coffee Jack needs to make over 24 days. Since he drinks 96 ounces of coffee every 2 days, he drinks 96 x 12 = 1152 ounces of coffee over 24 days. Since each batch of coffee is 192 ounces, Jack needs to make 1152/192 = 6 batches of coffee over 24 days. Finally, we need to figure out how long it takes Jack to make 6 batches of coffee. Since it takes 20 hours to make one batch of coffee, it takes 20 x 6 = 120 hours to make 6 batches of coffee. Therefore, Jack spends 120 hours making coffee over 24 days. The answer is 24.\n\n\n"
