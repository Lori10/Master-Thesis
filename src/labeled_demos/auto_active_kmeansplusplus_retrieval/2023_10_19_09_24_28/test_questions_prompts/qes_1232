  "test_question": "Q: Janet is collecting the results of Herbert Hoover Elementary School's annual standardized test. 340 out of 500 third-graders passed, along with 40 out of 100 fourth graders. The 400 fifth graders had a pass rate that was twice the fourth grades' pass rate. What is the school's overall pass rate?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: There are 13 3-year-olds, 20 4-year-olds, 15 5-year-olds, and 22 six-year-olds at a particular Sunday school. If the 3 and 4-year-olds are in one class and the 5 and 6-year-olds are in another class, what is the average class size?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of students in each class. For the 3 and 4-year-olds class, we add the number of 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds: 13 + 20 = 33 For the 5 and 6-year-olds class, we add the number of 5-year-olds and 6-year-olds: 15 + 22 = 37 Next, we need to find the average class size. To do this, we add the total number of students in both classes and divide by the number of classes: (33 + 37) / 2 = 35 Therefore, the average class size is 35 students. The answer is 35.\n\n\nQ: Forty percent of the students have elected to learn from home during the pandemic. The remaining students are divided into two equal groups, only one of which is physically in school on any day. What percent of students are present in school?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Let's assume that there are 100 students in total. Step 2: 40% of the students have elected to learn from home during the pandemic. So, the number of students learning from home is 40% of 100, which is 40. Step 3: The remaining students are 60 (100 - 40). Step 4: The remaining students are divided into two equal groups, so each group has 30 students. Step 5: Only one of the two groups is physically in school on any day. So, the number of students present in school is 30. Step 6: To find the percentage of students present in school, we need to divide the number of students present in school by the total number of students and multiply by 100. 30/100 x 100 = 30% Therefore, 30% of students are present in school. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: Aliya and her classmates are sent by their teacher to the field to collect insects for science class study. The Boys collected 200 insects and the girls collected 300 insects. The teacher decided to divide the class equally into four groups that each get an equal number of insects so that each group could study together. What was the number of insects given to each group?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of insects collected by the class. Total number of insects = 200 (boys) + 300 (girls) = 500 Step 2: Divide the total number of insects by the number of groups. Number of insects per group = 500 \u00f7 4 = 125 Step 3: Therefore, each group will get 125 insects to study. The answer is 125.\n\n\nQ: Jenny wants to read 3 books in the next 10 days. She can read 100 words per hour. If the first book has 200 words, the second book has 400 words, and the third book has 300 words, how many minutes per day, on average, should she spend reading?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find the total number of words in all three books: 200 + 400 + 300 = 900 words Next, let's find the total number of hours it will take Jenny to read all three books: 900 words \u00f7 100 words per hour = 9 hours Now, let's find the average number of minutes per day that Jenny should spend reading: 9 hours \u00f7 10 days = 0.9 hours per day 0.9 hours per day x 60 minutes per hour = 54 minutes per day Therefore, Jenny should spend an average of 54 minutes per day reading to finish all three books in 10 days. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour. Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour.  Oliver can read 40 pages.  How many pages can Carter read in 1 hour?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Oliver can read 40 pages in 1 hour. Next, we know that Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in 1 hour, so Lucy can read 40 + 20 = 60 pages in 1 hour. Finally, we know that Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in 1 hour, so Carter can read 60 / 2 = 30 pages in 1 hour. Therefore, Carter can read 30 pages in 1 hour. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many students are in Alice's class. We know that there are 40 students and 10 instructors, so the total number of people in the class is 40 + 10 = 50. Next, we need to figure out how many students are bringing their own life vests. We know that 20% of the students are bringing life vests, so we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of students by 0.2: 40 x 0.2 = 8. So 8 students are bringing their own life vests. Now we need to figure out how many life vests we still need. We have 20 life vests on hand, and we need one for each of the 50 people in the class. So we need 50 - 20 = 30 more life vests. However, we already know that 8 students are bringing their own life vests, so we can subtract those from the total number we need: 30 - 8 = 22. Therefore, Alice needs to get 22 more life vests so that the entire class has one. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Harold had 100 marbles. He kept 20 marbles and shared the rest evenly among his 5 friends. How many marbles did each friend get?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many marbles Harold gave away. To do this, we need to subtract the number of marbles he kept from the total number of marbles he had: 100 - 20 = 80 So Harold gave away 80 marbles. Step 2: Divide the number of marbles Harold gave away by the number of friends he shared them with. To do this, we need to divide 80 by 5: 80 \u00f7 5 = 16 So each friend got 16 marbles. Therefore, each friend got 16 marbles. The answer is 16.\n\n\nQ: In a school, the number of participants in the 2018 Science Quiz Bowl was 150. There were 20 more than twice the number of participants in 2019 as there were in 2018. In 2020, the number of participants was 40 less than half the number of participants in 2019. How many more participants were there in 2019 than in 2020?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many participants there were in 2019. We know that there were 20 more than twice the number of participants in 2018, so we can set up an equation: 2019 participants = 20 + 2 * 2018 participants 2019 participants = 20 + 2 * 150 2019 participants = 320 Next, we need to find out how many participants there were in 2020. We know that the number of participants in 2020 was 40 less than half the number of participants in 2019, so we can set up another equation: 2020 participants = 0.5 * 2019 participants - 40 2020 participants = 0.5 * 320 - 40 2020 participants = 80 Finally, we can find out how many more participants there were in 2019 than in 2020: 2019 participants - 2020 participants = 320 - 80 = 240 Therefore, there were 240 more participants in 2019 than in 2020. The answer is 2020.\n\n\n"
