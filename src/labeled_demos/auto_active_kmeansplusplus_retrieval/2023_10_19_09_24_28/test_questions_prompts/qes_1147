  "test_question": "Q: Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob to shingle a house. If Rob takes 2 hours, how many minutes does Royce take?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: It takes Omar 12 minutes to raise his kite 240 feet into the air. Jasper can raise his kite at three times the rate of speed as Omar can raise his kite. If Jasper raises his kite to a height of 600 feet, how many minutes will it take?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Jasper to raise his kite to a height of 240 feet, like Omar did. We know that Omar takes 12 minutes to raise his kite 240 feet, so we can set up a proportion: 12 minutes / 240 feet = x minutes / 600 feet To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 12 minutes * 600 feet = 240 feet * x minutes 7200 = 240x x = 30 So it would take Jasper 30 minutes to raise his kite to a height of 600 feet. The answer is 600.\n\n\nQ: Don can paint 3 tiles a minute, Ken can paint 2 more tiles a minute than Don and Laura can paint twice as many tiles as Ken. Kim can paint 3 fewer tiles than Laura can in a minute. How many tiles can Don, Ken, Laura and Kim paint in 15 minutes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many tiles each person can paint in one minute. Don can paint 3 tiles a minute. Ken can paint 2 more tiles a minute than Don, so Ken can paint 3 + 2 = 5 tiles a minute. Laura can paint twice as many tiles as Ken, so Laura can paint 5 x 2 = 10 tiles a minute. Kim can paint 3 fewer tiles than Laura can in a minute, so Kim can paint 10 - 3 = 7 tiles a minute. Now that we know how many tiles each person can paint in one minute, we can multiply that by 15 to find out how many tiles they can paint in 15 minutes. Don can paint 3 x 15 = 45 tiles in 15 minutes. Ken can paint 5 x 15 = 75 tiles in 15 minutes. Laura can paint 10 x 15 = 150 tiles in 15 minutes. Kim can paint 7 x 15 = 105 tiles in 15 minutes. Therefore, Don can paint 45 tiles, Ken can paint 75 tiles, Laura can paint 150 tiles, and Kim can paint 105 tiles in 15 minutes. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Carlos and Diego are racing around the block. Carlos runs around the entire block in 3 minutes. Diego runs around half the block in 2.5 minutes and then is tripped by a dog and can't finish. Assuming he kept up the same speed the entire race, what would've been the average time in seconds for the racers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Diego to run the entire block. Since he runs half the block in 2.5 minutes, we can use proportion to find out: 2.5 minutes = 1/2 block x minutes = 1 block Cross-multiplying, we get: 2.5 * 2 = x * 1 5 = x So it would take Diego 5 minutes to run the entire block if he hadn't been tripped. Now we can find the average time for the racers. We add up the time it took Carlos and the time it would've taken Diego, and divide by the number of racers: (3 minutes + 5 minutes) / 2 racers = 4 minutes But the question asks for the answer in seconds, so we need to convert minutes to seconds: 4 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 240 seconds So the average time for the racers would've been 240 seconds. The answer is 240.\n\n\nQ: For homework, Brooke has 15 math problems, 6 social studies problems, and 10 science problems. He can answer each math problem for 2 minutes while answering each social studies problem takes him 30 seconds. If he can answer each science problem in 1.5 minutes, how long will it take Brooke to answer all his homework?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total time Brooke needs to answer all the math problems: 15 math problems x 2 minutes per problem = 30 minutes Next, let's calculate the total time Brooke needs to answer all the social studies problems: 6 social studies problems x 30 seconds per problem = 3 minutes Note that we converted the time to minutes since the time for math problems is given in minutes. Finally, let's calculate the total time Brooke needs to answer all the science problems: 10 science problems x 1.5 minutes per problem = 15 minutes Now, we can add up the time for each subject to get the total time Brooke needs to answer all his homework: 30 minutes (math) + 3 minutes (social studies) + 15 minutes (science) = 48 minutes Therefore, it will take Brooke 48 minutes to answer all his homework. The answer is 48.\n\n\nQ: Marla has to spend 20 minutes driving one way to her son's school, then 70 minutes attending parent-teacher night, then the same amount of time driving home. How many minutes does Marla spend on this errand in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we add the time Marla spends driving to her son's school and driving back home: 20 minutes (driving to school) + 20 minutes (driving back home) = 40 minutes Next, we add the time Marla spends at the parent-teacher night: 40 minutes (driving) + 70 minutes (parent-teacher night) = 110 minutes Therefore, Marla spends a total of 110 minutes on this errand. The answer is 110.\n\n\nQ: To get to an island called \"Virgo\", Tom needs to travel by plane and then by boat. The plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, and the boat trip takes up to 2 hours. In how many hours is Tom able to get to the \"Virgo\" island?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long the plane trip is. We know that the plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, so we can set up an equation: plane trip = 4 * boat trip Since we know the boat trip takes 2 hours, we can substitute that in: plane trip = 4 * 2 plane trip = 8 So the plane trip is 8 hours. Now we just need to add the plane trip and the boat trip together to find the total time: total time = plane trip + boat trip total time = 8 + 2 total time = 10 So Tom is able to get to the \"Virgo\" island in 10 hours. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Debra is the host of a country music radio show, and she broadcasts interviews with celebrity country music singers. Each week, she interviews three singers, one at a time.  The first interview segment is always twice as long as the other two segments combined, and the third interview segment is always half as long as the second. If the third segment is 10 minutes long, how many minutes long is the entire show?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the third interview segment is 10 minutes long and is half as long as the second segment. Therefore, the second segment is 20 minutes long (10 x 2 = 20). Next, we know that the first segment is twice as long as the other two segments combined. So, the total length of the second and third segments is 20 + 10 = 30 minutes. Therefore, the first segment is 60 minutes long (30 x 2 = 60). Finally, to find the total length of the show, we add up the lengths of all three segments: 60 + 20 + 10 = 90 minutes. Therefore, the entire show is 90 minutes long. The answer is 90.\n\n\nQ: Tim decides to do a movie marathon.  The first movie is 2 hours long.  The next movie is 50% longer.  And the last movie is 1 hour shorter than the combined time of the previous 2 movies.  How long was his movie marathon?\nA: Let's think step by step. First movie: 2 hours Second movie: 50% longer than the first movie = 2 + (50/100)*2 = 3 hours Total time for the first two movies: 2 + 3 = 5 hours Third movie: 1 hour shorter than the combined time of the previous two movies = 5 - 1 = 4 hours Total time for the movie marathon: 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 hours Therefore, Tim's movie marathon was 9 hours long. The answer is 9.\n\n\n"
