  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Aliya and her classmates are sent by their teacher to the field to collect insects for science class study. The Boys collected 200 insects and the girls collected 300 insects. The teacher decided to divide the class equally into four groups that each get an equal number of insects so that each group could study together. What was the number of insects given to each group?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of insects collected by the class. Total number of insects = 200 (boys) + 300 (girls) = 500 Step 2: Divide the total number of insects by the number of groups. Number of insects per group = 500 \u00f7 4 = 125 Step 3: Therefore, each group will get 125 insects to study. The answer is 125.\n\n\nQ: A teacher is making packed lunches for a field trip. Each student needs 2 sandwiches, and will travel in a group with 5 other students. There are a total of 5 groups. How many pieces of bread will the teacher need to make enough sandwiches for all the students?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of students going on the field trip. Since each group has 6 students (1 student + 5 others), and there are 5 groups, the total number of students is: 6 students/group x 5 groups = 30 students Step 2: Find the total number of sandwiches needed. Since each student needs 2 sandwiches, the total number of sandwiches needed is: 2 sandwiches/student x 30 students = 60 sandwiches Step 3: Find the total number of bread slices needed. Since each sandwich has 2 slices of bread, the total number of bread slices needed is: 2 slices/sandwich x 60 sandwiches = 120 slices of bread Therefore, the teacher will need 120 slices of bread to make enough sandwiches for all the students. The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: There are 50 oysters on the rocks at La Push Park and 72 crabs by the beach. Eric, who loves walking by the beach, makes a note of this and goes home. The next day, he realizes only half the number of Oysters were on the rocks, and only 2/3 the number of crabs as the previous day are on the beach. How many oysters and crabs did he count in total in the two days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Eric counted 50 oysters and 72 crabs, so the total number of oysters and crabs he counted on the first day is: 50 + 72 = 122 On the second day, Eric realized only half the number of oysters were on the rocks, which means there were: 50 / 2 = 25 oysters on the rocks on the second day And only 2/3 the number of crabs as the previous day were on the beach, which means there were: 72 x 2/3 = 48 crabs on the beach on the second day So the total number of oysters and crabs Eric counted on the second day is: 25 + 48 = 73 Therefore, the total number of oysters and crabs Eric counted in total in the two days is: 122 + 73 = 195 The answer is 195.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Lewis found 4 more items on the scavenger hunt than Samantha.  Samantha found four times the amount of items than Tanya who was only able to find 4 items.  How many items did Lewis find?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many items Samantha found. We know that Samantha found four times the amount of items than Tanya, who found 4 items. So Samantha found 4 x 4 = 16 items. Next, we know that Lewis found 4 more items than Samantha. So we can add 4 to Samantha's total: 16 + 4 = 20. Therefore, Lewis found 20 items on the scavenger hunt. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Marion received 20 more turtles than Martha at the animal rescue center where they had gone to take part in the animal saving day event. If Martha received 40 turtles, how many turtles did they receive together?\nA: Let's think step by step. Martha received 40 turtles. Marion received 20 more turtles than Martha, which means Marion received 40 + 20 = 60 turtles. To find out how many turtles they received together, we need to add Martha's turtles to Marion's turtles: 40 + 60 = 100. Therefore, they received 100 turtles together. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: There were 90 jellybeans in a jar. Samantha snuck 24 jellybeans out of the jar, without being seen. Shelby ate 12 jellybeans from the jar. Their mom, Shannon, refilled the jar with half as much as Samantha and Shelby took out. How many jellybeans are in the jar now?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Samantha took out 24 jellybeans from the jar. Step 2: Shelby ate 12 jellybeans from the jar. Step 3: The total number of jellybeans taken out of the jar is 24 + 12 = 36. Step 4: Shannon refilled the jar with half as much as Samantha and Shelby took out, which is 1/2 * 36 = 18 jellybeans. Step 5: The total number of jellybeans in the jar now is 90 - 36 + 18 = 72 jellybeans. Therefore, there are 72 jellybeans in the jar now. The answer is 72.\n\n\nQ: MIlle is making snack packs for her kindergarten class. She's going to divide 64 pretzels, four times as many goldfish, and 32 suckers into baggies for the 16 kids in the class. How many items does each baggie have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many goldfish there are. We know that there are four times as many goldfish as pretzels, so: 64 pretzels x 4 = 256 goldfish Next, we need to add up the total number of items: 64 pretzels + 256 goldfish + 32 suckers = 352 items Now we can divide the total number of items by the number of baggies: 352 items \u00f7 16 baggies = 22 items per baggie Therefore, each baggie will have 22 items, which includes pretzels, goldfish, and suckers. The answer is 22.\n\n\n"
