  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Cynthia wants floor-to-ceiling curtains made with an additional 5\" of material so it will pool at the bottom. If her room is 8 feet tall, how long will the curtains need to be?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 8 feet to inches since the additional 5 inches will be added to the length. 8 feet = 96 inches Next, we add the additional 5 inches: 96 inches + 5 inches = 101 inches Therefore, the curtains will need to be 101 inches long. The answer is 101.\n\n\nQ: If a rectangle has a width of 42 inches and an area of 1638, how many rectangles of the same size would reach a length of 390 inches?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length of the rectangle with a width of 42 inches and an area of 1638. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width. Area = length x width 1638 = length x 42 Dividing both sides by 42: length = 1638/42 length = 39 So the length of the rectangle is 39 inches. Next, we need to find how many of these rectangles with a length of 39 inches can fit into a length of 390 inches. We can divide the total length by the length of one rectangle: 390/39 = 10 So 10 rectangles of the same size would reach a length of 390 inches. The answer is 390.\n\n\nQ: Lucas wants to get a dog but his parents think he already has too many pets and won't have enough space. He already has 12 pet beds in his room but manages to fit another 8 pet beds. His parents argue that each pet is going to need 2 beds each to feel comfortable. According to his parent's argument, how many pets does Lucas have enough room for?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pet beds Lucas has in total after adding the 8 new ones. 12 + 8 = 20 pet beds Next, we need to divide the total number of pet beds by 2 to find out how many pets can be accommodated. 20 \u00f7 2 = 10 pets Therefore, according to his parent's argument, Lucas has enough room for 10 pets. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Johnny is buying planks of wood to build some tables. Each table needs a plank of wood for each of the legs and 5 planks of wood for the surface. If Johnny wants to build 5 tables, how many planks of wood does he need?\nA: Let's think step by step. Each table needs 4 planks of wood for the legs (assuming it's a standard table with 4 legs). So for 5 tables, Johnny needs 5 x 4 = 20 planks of wood for the legs. Each table also needs 5 planks of wood for the surface, so for 5 tables, Johnny needs 5 x 5 = 25 planks of wood for the surfaces. Therefore, Johnny needs a total of 20 + 25 = 45 planks of wood to build 5 tables. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Tropical Storm Sally brings 3 days of rain to southern Texas.  The first day it rained 4 inches.  The second day it rained 5 times as much as the first day, and the third day it rained 6 inches less than the sum of the first two days.  How much did it rain on the third day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First day: 4 inches Second day: 5 times as much as the first day = 5 x 4 = 20 inches Third day: 6 inches less than the sum of the first two days = (4 + 20) - 6 = 18 inches Therefore, it rained 18 inches on the third day. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: James wants to build a ladder to climb a very tall tree.  Each rung of the ladder is 18 inches long and they are 6 inches apart.  If he needs to climb 50 feet how many feet of wood will he need for the rungs?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 50 feet to inches since the length of the rungs is given in inches. 50 feet = 600 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches) Next, we need to figure out how many rungs James will need. We know that each rung is 18 inches long and they are 6 inches apart. So, the total length of each \"rung + gap\" is 24 inches. To find the number of rungs, we can divide the total height of the ladder (600 inches) by the length of each \"rung + gap\" (24 inches). 600 inches \u00f7 24 inches = 25 rungs Finally, we can calculate the total length of wood needed for the rungs by multiplying the length of each rung (18 inches) by the number of rungs (25). 18 inches x 25 rungs = 450 inches To convert this back to feet, we divide by 12: 450 inches \u00f7 12 inches/foot = 37.5 feet So James will need 37.5 feet of wood for the rungs of his ladder. The answer is 38.\n\n\nQ: In mid-May, the depth of a river in Moreland is measured. By mid-June, the river is 10 feet deeper than mid-May. By mid-July, the river is three times deeper than mid-June. If the river is 45 feet deep in mid-July, how many feet deep was the river in mid-May?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that in mid-June, the river is 10 feet deeper than mid-May. So, if we let x be the depth of the river in mid-May, then the depth of the river in mid-June is x + 10. Next, we know that in mid-July, the river is three times deeper than mid-June. So, if we let y be the depth of the river in mid-July, then we can write: y = 3(x + 10) We also know that the river is 45 feet deep in mid-July, so we can substitute that into the equation: 45 = 3(x + 10) Simplifying the equation, we get: 15 = x + 10 Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 5 = x Therefore, the river was 5 feet deep in mid-May. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Gerald is a furniture maker. He has 672 pieces of wood and he wants to make some tables and chairs. It takes 12 pieces of wood to make a table and 8 pieces of wood to make a chair. How many chairs can he make if he makes 24 tables?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many pieces of wood Gerald will use to make 24 tables. To make one table, he needs 12 pieces of wood. So to make 24 tables, he will need: 12 x 24 = 288 pieces of wood Now, let's subtract the pieces of wood used for the tables from the total number of pieces of wood Gerald has: 672 - 288 = 384 pieces of wood left Finally, let's find out how many chairs Gerald can make with the remaining pieces of wood. To make one chair, he needs 8 pieces of wood. So the number of chairs he can make is: 384 \u00f7 8 = 48 chairs Therefore, Gerald can make 48 chairs if he makes 24 tables. The answer is 24.\n\n\n"
