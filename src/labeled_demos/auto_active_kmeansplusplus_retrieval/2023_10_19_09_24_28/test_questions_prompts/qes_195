  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Whitney\u2019s mom gave her two $20 bills to spend at the school book fair. Whitney has decided to buy 2 posters, 3 notebooks, and 2 bookmarks. Each poster costs $5, each notebook costs $4, and each bookmark costs $2. How much money, in dollars, will Whitney have left over after the purchase?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of the posters. Whitney is buying 2 posters, and each poster costs $5, so the total cost of the posters is 2 x $5 = $10. Next, let's calculate the total cost of the notebooks. Whitney is buying 3 notebooks, and each notebook costs $4, so the total cost of the notebooks is 3 x $4 = $12. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the bookmarks. Whitney is buying 2 bookmarks, and each bookmark costs $2, so the total cost of the bookmarks is 2 x $2 = $4. Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Whitney is buying: $10 + $12 + $4 = $26. Whitney started with two $20 bills, which is a total of $40. After spending $26 on the posters, notebooks, and bookmarks, she will have $40 - $26 = $14 left over. Therefore, Whitney will have $14 left over after the purchase. The answer is 14.\n\n\nQ: A department store offers a 10% discount for the amount exceeding $100 of the customer's total charge. Jaco bought a pair of shoes for $74; 2 pairs of socks that cost $2 per pair; a bag that costs $42. How much will Jaco pay for those items?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jaco bought: - Shoes: $74 - Socks: 2 pairs x $2 per pair = $4 - Bag: $42 Total cost = $74 + $4 + $42 = $120 Since the total cost exceeds $100, Jaco is eligible for a discount. The amount that exceeds $100 is $20 ($120 - $100). The discount is 10% of $20, which is $2. Therefore, Jaco will pay the total cost minus the discount: Total cost - discount = $120 - $2 = $118 Jaco will pay $118 for those items. The answer is 118.\n\n\nQ: Frank's laundry detergent is double concentrated and will wash 80 loads of laundry.  His detergent is usually $25.00 a bottle but they're having a sale.  If he buys 2 bottles, both bottles will drop to $20.00 a bottle.  How much does he spend, in cents, per load of laundry, if he buys 2 bottles of detergent?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the cost of one bottle of detergent during the sale: $25.00 - $20.00 = $5.00 discount per bottle $25.00 - $5.00 = $20.00 per bottle during the sale Since Frank buys 2 bottles during the sale, he spends: 2 bottles x $20.00 per bottle = $40.00 Now, let's calculate the cost per load of laundry: $40.00 for 2 bottles x 80 loads per bottle = 160 loads $40.00 for 160 loads = $0.25 per load Therefore, Frank spends 25 cents per load of laundry if he buys 2 bottles of detergent during the sale. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: To buy a book, you pay $20 for each of the first 5 books at the supermarket, and for each additional book you buy over $20, you receive a discount of $2. If Beatrice bought 20 books, how much did she pay at the supermarket?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the first 5 books, which is simply: $20 x 5 = $100 Next, we need to calculate the cost of the remaining 15 books. Since Beatrice gets a $2 discount for each book over $20, we can calculate the cost of each book as: $20 - $2 = $18 Therefore, the cost of the remaining 15 books is: $18 x 15 = $270 Finally, we can calculate the total cost by adding the cost of the first 5 books to the cost of the remaining 15 books: $100 + $270 = $370 Therefore, Beatrice paid $370 at the supermarket for 20 books. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: A gallon of whole milk that normally costs $3 is now sold at $2. A box of cereal was sold at a discount of $1. How much will you save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the discount for each gallon of whole milk. The discount is $3 - $2 = $1 per gallon. So, if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk, you will save 3 x $1 = $3. Next, let's calculate the discount for each box of cereal. The discount is $1 per box. So, if you buy 5 boxes of cereal, you will save 5 x $1 = $5. Therefore, the total amount you will save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal is $3 + $5 = $8. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how much money Carl will earn in four weeks. If he earns $0.50 every time, and he buys a candy bar each time, that means he's spending $0.50 each week. But he's also earning $0.75 each week for taking out his neighbor's trash. So his net earnings each week are $0.75 - $0.50 = $0.25. Over four weeks, that's a total of $0.25 x 4 = $1. So Carl will have $1 to spend on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.50, he can buy 2 candy bars with his earnings. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Martha needs 4 cups of berries and 2 cups of heavy cream to make 1 quart of ice cream.  She wants to make 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream.  At the farmers market, the 2 cup packages of strawberries are $3.00 each and the 2 cup package of raspberries are $5.00 each.  The heavy cream is sold for $4.00 for a 4 cup container.  How much will it cost her to make 1 quart of each ice cream?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how many packages of strawberries and raspberries Martha needs to make 1 quart of each ice cream. Since she needs 4 cups of berries for 1 quart of ice cream, and each package contains 2 cups, she will need 2 packages of strawberries and 2 packages of raspberries for both quarts of ice cream. The cost of the strawberries will be 2 packages x $3.00 per package = $6.00 for 1 quart of strawberry ice cream. The cost of the raspberries will be 2 packages x $5.00 per package = $10.00 for 1 quart of raspberry ice cream. Next, we need to calculate the cost of the heavy cream. Martha needs 2 cups of heavy cream for 1 quart of ice cream, so she will need 4 cups of heavy cream for both quarts of ice cream. The cost of the heavy cream is $4.00 for a 4 cup container, so it will cost $4.00 for both quarts of ice cream. Therefore, the total cost of making 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream is: $6.00 (strawberries) + $10.00 (raspberries) + $4.00 (heavy cream) = $20.00 The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Apples used to cost $1.6 per pound.  The price got raised 25%.  How much does it cost to buy 2 pounds of apples for each person in a 4 member family?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Calculate the new price of apples after the 25% increase. The price increase is 25% of $1.6, which is (25/100) x $1.6 = $0.4. So, the new price of apples is $1.6 + $0.4 = $2. Step 2: Calculate the cost of buying 2 pounds of apples for each person in the family. Since there are 4 members in the family, we need to buy 2 x 4 = 8 pounds of apples in total. The cost of buying 1 pound of apples is $2, so the cost of buying 8 pounds of apples is 8 x $2 = $16. Therefore, it would cost $16 to buy 2 pounds of apples for each person in a 4 member family. The answer is 4.\n\n\n"
