  "test_question": "Q: Ram uses a lot of pens. He discovered that he can save money by mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. If he buys 25 pens and then uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low, how many total pens does he get to have?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Eric sorted 150 colored pencils into 5 containers for his art class. Before class, another teacher brought him 30 more pencils. How many can he evenly distribute between the five containers now?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of pencils Eric has now. To do this, we add the original 150 pencils to the 30 pencils brought by the other teacher: 150 + 30 = 180 So Eric now has 180 colored pencils. Next, we need to find out how many pencils he can evenly distribute between the five containers. To do this, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of containers: 180 \u00f7 5 = 36 Therefore, Eric can evenly distribute 36 colored pencils between each of the five containers. The answer is 36.\n\n\nQ: Bart buys $10 of notepads for $1.25 each.  They have 60 pages each.  How many pages did he buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many notepads Bart bought. We can do this by dividing the total amount he spent by the cost of each notepad: $10 \u00f7 $1.25 = 8 notepads Next, we need to find out how many pages are in each notepad and multiply that by the number of notepads: 60 pages/notepad x 8 notepads = 480 pages Therefore, Bart bought 480 pages of notepads. The answer is 480.\n\n\nQ: Stacy bought two packs of printer paper for the office. Each pack has 240 sheets of paper. Her office prints 80 one-page documents per day. How many days will the printer paper last her office?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many sheets of paper Stacy bought in total. Since she bought two packs, each with 240 sheets, we can multiply 2 by 240 to get: 2 x 240 = 480 So Stacy bought 480 sheets of paper in total. Next, we need to figure out how many pages her office prints per day. We know they print 80 one-page documents per day, so that means they print: 80 x 1 = 80 pages per day Now we can use this information to figure out how many days the paper will last. We can divide the total number of sheets by the number of pages printed per day: 480 / 80 = 6 So the printer paper will last Stacy's office 6 days. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Bertha plays tennis. Every ten games, one of her tennis balls wears out. Every five games, she loses a ball. Every four games, she buys a canister of three balls. She started with two balls and gave one to her partner. After twenty games, how many tennis balls does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Bertha started with two balls and gave one to her partner, so she has one ball left. Next, we need to figure out how many balls she loses and how many wear out. In 20 games, she loses 20/5 = 4 balls and 20/10 = 2 balls wear out. Finally, we need to figure out how many balls she buys. In 20 games, she buys 20/4 = 5 canisters of three balls, which is a total of 5*3 = 15 balls. So, in total, Bertha has 1 (starting ball) - 4 (lost balls) - 2 (worn out balls) + 15 (bought balls) = 10 tennis balls. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: There are 50 marbles in a box which has a mixture of white, red and blue marbles. There were originally 20 white marbles and an equal number of red and blue marbles. Jack removes a number of marbles equal to double the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles. How many marbles are left in the box?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 20 white marbles and an equal number of red and blue marbles. So, we can say that there are 20 white, 15 red, and 15 blue marbles in the box. Next, we need to find the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles. In this case, the difference is 20 - 15 = 5. Then, we need to double that difference, which gives us 5 x 2 = 10. Jack removes 10 marbles from the box. So, the number of marbles left in the box is 50 - 10 = 40 marbles. The answer is 40.\n\n\nQ: Adam has just bought some new books so he has decided to clean up his bookcase. After he adds his new books to his bookshelf he realizes that he has bought enough books to finish completely filling his bookcase with 2 books left over. Before his shopping trip, Adam had 56 books in his bookcase. If his bookcase has 4 shelves and averages 20 books per shelf, how many books did Adam buy on his shopping trip?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many books can fit on Adam's bookcase. We know that he has 4 shelves and each shelf can hold an average of 20 books, so the total capacity of his bookcase is: 4 shelves x 20 books per shelf = 80 books Next, we need to figure out how many books Adam had before his shopping trip. We know that he had 56 books in his bookcase before he bought any new books. Now, we can use the information given in the problem to figure out how many books Adam bought on his shopping trip. We know that he bought enough books to completely fill his bookcase with 2 books left over. This means that he bought: 80 books - 2 books left over = 78 books Therefore, Adam bought 78 books on his shopping trip. The answer is 78.\n\n\nQ: Oliver had $9, then he saved $5 from his allowance and spent $4 on a frisbee and $3 on a puzzle. His friend gives him another $8 as it's his birthday. How much money does Oliver have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. Oliver had $9. He saved $5 from his allowance, so he now has $9 + $5 = $14. He spent $4 on a frisbee, so he now has $14 - $4 = $10. He spent another $3 on a puzzle, so he now has $10 - $3 = $7. His friend gives him another $8, so he now has $7 + $8 = $15. Therefore, Oliver has $15 left. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Hanna has twice as many erasers as Rachel.  Rachel has three less than one-half as many erasers as Tanya has red erasers.  If Tanya has 20 erasers, and half of them are red, how many erasers does Hanna have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red erasers Tanya has. We know that half of her erasers are red, so: 20/2 = 10 red erasers Next, we need to figure out how many erasers Rachel has. We know that Rachel has three less than one-half as many erasers as Tanya has red erasers, so: (1/2) * 20 - 3 = 7 erasers Finally, we need to find out how many erasers Hanna has, since we know she has twice as many as Rachel. Therefore: 2 * 7 = 14 erasers So, Hanna has 14 erasers. The answer is 14.\n\n\n"
