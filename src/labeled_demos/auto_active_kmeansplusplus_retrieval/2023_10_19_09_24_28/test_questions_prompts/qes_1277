  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Ella has 4 bags with 20 apples in each bag and six bags with 25 apples in each bag. If Ella sells 200 apples, how many apples does Ella has left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many apples Ella has in total. She has 4 bags with 20 apples in each bag, so that's 4 x 20 = 80 apples. She also has 6 bags with 25 apples in each bag, so that's 6 x 25 = 150 apples. In total, Ella has 80 + 150 = 230 apples. If she sells 200 apples, we can subtract that from the total: 230 - 200 = 30 Therefore, Ella has 30 apples left. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: Alice's white water rafting class is composed of 40 students and 10 instructors, including herself.  She has 20 life vests on hand.  20% of her students are bringing life vests.  How many more life vests will Alice need to get so that entire class has one?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many students are in Alice's class. We know that there are 40 students and 10 instructors, so the total number of people in the class is 40 + 10 = 50. Next, we need to figure out how many students are bringing their own life vests. We know that 20% of the students are bringing life vests, so we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of students by 0.2: 40 x 0.2 = 8. So 8 students are bringing their own life vests. Now we need to figure out how many life vests we still need. We have 20 life vests on hand, and we need one for each of the 50 people in the class. So we need 50 - 20 = 30 more life vests. However, we already know that 8 students are bringing their own life vests, so we can subtract those from the total number we need: 30 - 8 = 22. Therefore, Alice needs to get 22 more life vests so that the entire class has one. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: There are 10 bags with 30 oranges each on a truck. A total of 50 pieces of oranges are rotten. Thirty pieces of oranges will be kept for making orange juice and the rest will be sold. How many pieces of oranges will be sold?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of oranges in the 10 bags. 10 bags x 30 oranges/bag = 300 oranges Next, we need to subtract the number of rotten oranges. 300 oranges - 50 rotten oranges = 250 good oranges Now, we know that 30 oranges will be kept for making juice. 250 good oranges - 30 oranges for juice = 220 oranges to be sold Therefore, 220 pieces of oranges will be sold. The answer is 220.\n\n\nQ: A teacher is making packed lunches for a field trip. Each student needs 2 sandwiches, and will travel in a group with 5 other students. There are a total of 5 groups. How many pieces of bread will the teacher need to make enough sandwiches for all the students?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of students going on the field trip. Since each group has 6 students (1 student + 5 others), and there are 5 groups, the total number of students is: 6 students/group x 5 groups = 30 students Step 2: Find the total number of sandwiches needed. Since each student needs 2 sandwiches, the total number of sandwiches needed is: 2 sandwiches/student x 30 students = 60 sandwiches Step 3: Find the total number of bread slices needed. Since each sandwich has 2 slices of bread, the total number of bread slices needed is: 2 slices/sandwich x 60 sandwiches = 120 slices of bread Therefore, the teacher will need 120 slices of bread to make enough sandwiches for all the students. The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: Dani brings two and half dozen cupcakes for her 2nd-grade class.  There are 27 students (including Dani), 1 teacher, and 1 teacher\u2019s aid.  If 3 students called in sick that day, how many cupcakes are left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Dani brought in total. Two and a half dozen cupcakes is equal to 30 cupcakes (since a dozen is 12). Next, we need to figure out how many people will be receiving cupcakes. There are 27 students, 1 teacher, and 1 teacher's aid, for a total of 29 people. However, 3 students called in sick, so we need to subtract them from the total. 29 - 3 = 26 people receiving cupcakes. Now, we need to subtract 26 cupcakes from the total number of cupcakes Dani brought. 30 - 26 = 4 cupcakes left after Dani gives one to everyone in the class. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Eric sorted 150 colored pencils into 5 containers for his art class. Before class, another teacher brought him 30 more pencils. How many can he evenly distribute between the five containers now?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of pencils Eric has now. To do this, we add the original 150 pencils to the 30 pencils brought by the other teacher: 150 + 30 = 180 So Eric now has 180 colored pencils. Next, we need to find out how many pencils he can evenly distribute between the five containers. To do this, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of containers: 180 \u00f7 5 = 36 Therefore, Eric can evenly distribute 36 colored pencils between each of the five containers. The answer is 36.\n\n\nQ: Vicente saw Sophie's mom giving Sophie 20 oranges every day to carry to school to eat. He also saw Hannah's dad giving Hannah 40 grapes every day to eat at the school. If he counted the number of fruits that the girls were given for 30 days, calculate the total number of fruits that Sophie and Hannah had eaten in the 30 days.\nA: Let's think step by step. Sophie was given 20 oranges every day for 30 days, so the total number of oranges she received is: 20 oranges/day x 30 days = 600 oranges Similarly, Hannah was given 40 grapes every day for 30 days, so the total number of grapes she received is: 40 grapes/day x 30 days = 1200 grapes Therefore, the total number of fruits that Sophie and Hannah had eaten in the 30 days is: 600 oranges + 1200 grapes = 1800 fruits The answer is 1800.\n\n\nQ: Merry had 50 boxes of apples on Saturday and 25 boxes on Sunday. There were 10 apples in each box. If she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, how many boxes of apples are left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many apples Merry had in total. On Saturday, she had 50 boxes of apples, and each box had 10 apples, so she had 50 x 10 = 500 apples on Saturday. On Sunday, she had 25 boxes of apples, and each box had 10 apples, so she had 25 x 10 = 250 apples on Sunday. In total, she had 500 + 250 = 750 apples. Next, we need to find out how many apples she sold. We know that she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, so she must have had 750 - 720 = 30 apples left. Finally, we need to find out how many boxes of apples she has left. We know that there are 10 apples in each box, so she must have 30 / 10 = 3 boxes of apples left. Therefore, Merry has 3 boxes of apples left. The answer is 3.\n\n\n"
