  "test_question": "Q: A bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning and half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. How many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The bakery makes 3 batches of baguettes a day.  Each batch has 48 baguettes.  After the first batch came out, he sold 37.  After the second batch, he sold 52.  After the third batch he sold 49.  How many baguettes are left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many baguettes were made in total. 3 batches x 48 baguettes per batch = 144 baguettes Next, we need to subtract the number of baguettes sold after each batch. After the first batch: 144 - 37 = 107 baguettes left After the second batch: 107 - 52 = 55 baguettes left After the third batch: 55 - 49 = 6 baguettes left Therefore, there are 6 baguettes left after all three batches were made and sold. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: A bakery sells boxes of doughnuts and if there are any doughnuts left at the end of the day, the bakery gives them away. Each box of doughnuts holds 10 doughnuts and all of the doughnuts that the bakery makes are put into these boxes. The bakery makes 300 doughnuts for the day and sells 27 boxes of doughnuts throughout the day. How many doughnuts are given away at the end of the day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many doughnuts were sold during the day. We know that each box contains 10 doughnuts, so 27 boxes would contain 27 x 10 = 270 doughnuts. Next, we can subtract the number of doughnuts sold from the total number of doughnuts made to find out how many were left over. 300 - 270 = 30 Therefore, there are 30 doughnuts left at the end of the day that will be given away. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: There are four members in one household. Each member consumes 3 slices of bread during breakfast and 2 slices of bread for snacks. A loaf of bread has 12 slices. How many days will five loaves of bread last in this family?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of bread each member consumes per day. For breakfast, each member consumes 3 slices of bread. For snacks, each member consumes 2 slices of bread. So, in total, each member consumes 3 + 2 = 5 slices of bread per day. Since there are four members in the household, the total number of slices of bread consumed per day is 4 x 5 = 20 slices. Now, we need to find out how many days five loaves of bread will last. One loaf of bread has 12 slices, so five loaves of bread have 5 x 12 = 60 slices. If the family consumes 20 slices of bread per day, then 60 slices will last for 60/20 = 3 days. Therefore, five loaves of bread will last for 3 days in this family. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Brenda bakes 20 cakes a day. She does this for 9 days and then sells half of the cakes. How many cakes are left with Brenda?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cakes Brenda bakes in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of cakes she bakes per day (20) by the number of days she bakes (9): 20 cakes/day x 9 days = 180 cakes So Brenda bakes 180 cakes in total. Next, we need to find out how many cakes Brenda sells. We know she sells half of the cakes, which is the same as dividing the total number of cakes by 2: 180 cakes / 2 = 90 cakes So Brenda sells 90 cakes. Finally, we need to find out how many cakes Brenda has left. To do this, we can subtract the number of cakes she sold from the total number of cakes she baked: 180 cakes - 90 cakes = 90 cakes So Brenda has 90 cakes left. The answer is 90.\n\n\nQ: A teacher is making packed lunches for a field trip. Each student needs 2 sandwiches, and will travel in a group with 5 other students. There are a total of 5 groups. How many pieces of bread will the teacher need to make enough sandwiches for all the students?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of students going on the field trip. Since each group has 6 students (1 student + 5 others), and there are 5 groups, the total number of students is: 6 students/group x 5 groups = 30 students Step 2: Find the total number of sandwiches needed. Since each student needs 2 sandwiches, the total number of sandwiches needed is: 2 sandwiches/student x 30 students = 60 sandwiches Step 3: Find the total number of bread slices needed. Since each sandwich has 2 slices of bread, the total number of bread slices needed is: 2 slices/sandwich x 60 sandwiches = 120 slices of bread Therefore, the teacher will need 120 slices of bread to make enough sandwiches for all the students. The answer is 120.\n\n\nQ: Shane prepares sandwiches for the Boy Scouts. He buys 2 packages of sliced bread containing 20 slices each, and he also buys 2 packages of sliced ham containing 8 slices each. Shane will make as many sandwiches as he can according to the ham he has. How many slices of bread will he have leftover?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of ham Shane has in total. 2 packages of sliced ham containing 8 slices each = 2 x 8 = 16 slices of ham Now, we know that Shane will make as many sandwiches as he can according to the ham he has. Since each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread, we can calculate the maximum number of sandwiches he can make: 16 slices of ham / 2 slices of bread per sandwich = 8 sandwiches So, Shane will make 8 sandwiches. Each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread, so he will use: 8 sandwiches x 2 slices of bread per sandwich = 16 slices of bread Shane has 2 packages of sliced bread containing 20 slices each, so he has: 2 packages x 20 slices per package = 40 slices of bread Therefore, he will have: 40 slices of bread - 16 slices of bread used = 24 slices of bread leftover. So, Shane will have 24 slices of bread leftover. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Carl has a goal of selling 96 cupcakes in 2 days. Carl needs to give 24 cupcakes to Bonnie as payment for using her storefront. How many cupcakes must Carl sell per day to reach his goal?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to subtract the 24 cupcakes that Carl needs to give to Bonnie from his goal of selling 96 cupcakes. 96 - 24 = 72 So Carl needs to sell 72 cupcakes in 2 days. To find out how many cupcakes he needs to sell per day, we can divide 72 by 2: 72 \u00f7 2 = 36 Therefore, Carl needs to sell 36 cupcakes per day to reach his goal of selling 96 cupcakes in 2 days, after giving 24 cupcakes to Bonnie. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Betty and Dora started making some cupcakes at the same time. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour and Dora makes 8 every hour. If Betty took a two-hour break, what is the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Betty made in the first 3 hours before taking a break. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour, so in 3 hours, she would make: 10 cupcakes/hour x 3 hours = 30 cupcakes Next, we need to find out how many cupcakes Dora made in the same 5 hours. Dora makes 8 cupcakes every hour, so in 5 hours, she would make: 8 cupcakes/hour x 5 hours = 40 cupcakes Now we need to find the difference between the number of cupcakes they made. Betty made 30 cupcakes before taking a break, and Dora made 40 cupcakes in the same 5 hours. So the difference between the number of cupcakes they made is: 40 cupcakes - 30 cupcakes = 10 cupcakes Therefore, the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours is 10 cupcakes. The answer is 10.\n\n\n"
