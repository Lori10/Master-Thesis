  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Susan is picking strawberries. She's trying to fill her basket, but out of every handful of 5 strawberries she can't help but eat one of them herself. If her basket holds 60 strawberries, how many berries will she actually pick before she fills it?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many strawberries Susan will pick in each handful. If she eats one out of every five, that means she will pick four out of every five. So, for every handful of 5 strawberries, she will pick 4. Next, we need to figure out how many handfuls of strawberries Susan will need to pick to fill her basket. If her basket holds 60 strawberries, and she picks 4 strawberries per handful, then she will need to pick 60/4 = 15 handfuls of strawberries. Finally, we need to figure out how many strawberries she will actually pick before she fills her basket. Since she eats one out of every five strawberries, that means she will eat 1/5 of the strawberries she picks. So, for every 5 strawberries she picks, she will eat one and keep four. Therefore, she will actually pick 15 x 5 = 75 strawberries before she fills her basket. The answer is 75.\n\n\nQ: A tomato plant has 100 tomatoes. Jane picks 1/4 of that number for use in their house. After a week, she goes back and picks 20 more tomatoes, and the following week picks twice that number. What's the total number of fruits remaining on the tomato plant?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Jane picks 1/4 of 100 tomatoes, which is 25 tomatoes. So, there are 100 - 25 = 75 tomatoes left on the plant. After a week, Jane picks 20 more tomatoes, so there are 75 - 20 = 55 tomatoes left on the plant. The following week, Jane picks twice the number of tomatoes she picked the previous week, which is 2 * 20 = 40 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes Jane picked is 25 + 20 + 40 = 85 tomatoes. The total number of tomatoes remaining on the plant is 100 - 85 = 15 tomatoes. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: A total of 107 oranges are picked by Del and Juan. Del picked 23 on each of 2 days and Juan picked the rest. How many oranges did Juan pick?\nA: Let's think step by step. Del picked 23 oranges on each of 2 days, so he picked a total of 23 x 2 = 46 oranges. If the total number of oranges picked by both Del and Juan is 107, then Juan picked 107 - 46 = 61 oranges. Therefore, Juan picked 61 oranges. The answer is 61.\n\n\nQ: Brenda picks 250 peaches. When she sorts through them, only 60% are fresh, and Brenda has to throw 15 away for being too small. How many peaches does Brenda have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many peaches are fresh. We can do this by multiplying the total number of peaches by the percentage that are fresh: 250 x 0.6 = 150 So Brenda has 150 fresh peaches. Next, we need to subtract the 15 peaches that she threw away: 150 - 15 = 135 Therefore, Brenda has 135 peaches left after sorting through them. The answer is 135.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: Betty and Dora started making some cupcakes at the same time. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour and Dora makes 8 every hour. If Betty took a two-hour break, what is the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Betty made in the first 3 hours before taking a break. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour, so in 3 hours, she would make: 10 cupcakes/hour x 3 hours = 30 cupcakes Next, we need to find out how many cupcakes Dora made in the same 5 hours. Dora makes 8 cupcakes every hour, so in 5 hours, she would make: 8 cupcakes/hour x 5 hours = 40 cupcakes Now we need to find the difference between the number of cupcakes they made. Betty made 30 cupcakes before taking a break, and Dora made 40 cupcakes in the same 5 hours. So the difference between the number of cupcakes they made is: 40 cupcakes - 30 cupcakes = 10 cupcakes Therefore, the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours is 10 cupcakes. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Cassandra bought four dozen Granny Smith apples and used them to make four apple pies.  She cut each pie into 6 large pieces.  How many apples are in each slice of pie?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Determine the total number of apples Cassandra bought. - One dozen is equal to 12, so four dozen is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 apples. Step 2: Determine the total number of pieces of pie Cassandra made. - Each pie was cut into 6 pieces, so four pies would be cut into 4 x 6 = 24 pieces. Step 3: Determine the number of apples in each slice of pie. - To do this, we need to divide the total number of apples by the total number of pieces of pie. - 48 apples / 24 pieces = 2 apples per slice of pie. Therefore, there are 2 apples in each slice of pie. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Vicente saw Sophie's mom giving Sophie 20 oranges every day to carry to school to eat. He also saw Hannah's dad giving Hannah 40 grapes every day to eat at the school. If he counted the number of fruits that the girls were given for 30 days, calculate the total number of fruits that Sophie and Hannah had eaten in the 30 days.\nA: Let's think step by step. Sophie was given 20 oranges every day for 30 days, so the total number of oranges she received is: 20 oranges/day x 30 days = 600 oranges Similarly, Hannah was given 40 grapes every day for 30 days, so the total number of grapes she received is: 40 grapes/day x 30 days = 1200 grapes Therefore, the total number of fruits that Sophie and Hannah had eaten in the 30 days is: 600 oranges + 1200 grapes = 1800 fruits The answer is 1800.\n\n\n"
