  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Larry spends half an hour twice a day walking and playing with his dog. He also spends a fifth of an hour every day feeding his dog. How many minutes does Larry spend on his dog each day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many minutes Larry spends walking and playing with his dog each day. Larry spends half an hour twice a day, so that's 0.5 x 2 = 1 hour per day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Larry spends 1 x 60 = 60 minutes per day walking and playing with his dog. Next, we need to find out how many minutes Larry spends feeding his dog each day. Larry spends a fifth of an hour feeding his dog, which is 0.2 hours. Again, since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Larry spends 0.2 x 60 = 12 minutes per day feeding his dog. Finally, we can add the time Larry spends walking and playing with his dog to the time he spends feeding his dog to find out how many minutes he spends on his dog each day. Larry spends 60 + 12 = 72 minutes on his dog each day. The answer is 72.\n\n\nQ: Bingo has two dogs. On average, they walk a total of 70 miles a week. The first dog walks an average of 2 miles a day. How many miles a day does the other dog average?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many miles the first dog walks in a week. We can do this by multiplying the number of miles the dog walks in a day by the number of days in a week: 2 miles/day x 7 days/week = 14 miles/week Now we can find out how many miles the second dog walks in a week by subtracting the first dog's weekly distance from the total weekly distance: 70 miles/week - 14 miles/week = 56 miles/week Finally, we can find out how many miles the second dog walks in a day by dividing its weekly distance by the number of days in a week: 56 miles/week \u00f7 7 days/week = 8 miles/day Therefore, the second dog averages 8 miles a day. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Paul has five dogs. For every 10 pounds they weigh, they need 1 pound of dog food per day. One weighs 20 pounds. One weighs 40. Another weighs 10. One weighs 30 and the final one weighs 50 pounds. How much dog food does he need each day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total weight of all five dogs. Total weight = 20 + 40 + 10 + 30 + 50 = 150 pounds Next, we need to calculate how much dog food is needed per day for every 10 pounds of weight. 1 pound of dog food is needed for every 10 pounds of weight So, for 150 pounds of weight, we need: 150/10 = 15 pounds of dog food per day Therefore, Paul needs 15 pounds of dog food each day to feed his five dogs. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Arthur has 3 dogs. They eat an average of 15 pounds of food a week. One dog eats 13 pounds a week. The second eats double this. How much does the third dog eat a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the total amount of food the three dogs eat in a week is 15 pounds per dog * 3 dogs = 45 pounds. Next, we know that one of the dogs eats 13 pounds per week. So, the other two dogs must eat a total of 45 pounds - 13 pounds = 32 pounds per week. We also know that the second dog eats double what the first dog eats, which is 13 pounds. So, the second dog eats 2 * 13 pounds = 26 pounds per week. To find out how much the third dog eats, we can subtract the amount the first and second dogs eat from the total amount of food the three dogs eat: 45 pounds - 13 pounds - 26 pounds = 6 pounds Therefore, the third dog eats 6 pounds of food per week. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Melody has three dogs. Each dog eats 1/2 of a pound of dog food twice a day. If Melody bought 30 pounds of dog food, how many pounds of dog food are left after a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much dog food each dog eats in a day. Since each dog eats 1/2 of a pound of dog food twice a day, each dog eats a total of 1 pound of dog food per day (1/2 + 1/2 = 1). So, three dogs would eat a total of 3 pounds of dog food per day (3 x 1 = 3). In a week, which is 7 days, the dogs would eat a total of 21 pounds of dog food (3 x 7 = 21). If Melody bought 30 pounds of dog food and the dogs ate 21 pounds in a week, then there would be 9 pounds of dog food left (30 - 21 = 9). Therefore, after a week, Melody would have 9 pounds of dog food left. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Larry jogs for 30 minutes each day. In the first week, he jogs for 3 days while he jogs for 5 days in the second week. How many hours does he jog in total for two weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days Larry jogs in two weeks. Larry jogs for 3 days in the first week and 5 days in the second week, so he jogs for a total of 3 + 5 = 8 days in two weeks. Next, we need to find out how many hours Larry jogs in one day. Larry jogs for 30 minutes each day, which is equivalent to 0.5 hours. Finally, we can calculate how many hours Larry jogs in total for two weeks by multiplying the number of days by the number of hours per day: 8 days x 0.5 hours per day = 4 hours Therefore, Larry jogs for a total of 4 hours in two weeks. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Every Monday to Friday morning, Alice walks 10 miles through a large grass field to get to school. To avoid the hot afternoon sun on her way home, she walks 12 miles through a forest. When she gets home on Friday, how many miles will she have walked that week?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. Alice walks 10 miles every morning from Monday to Friday. So, in total, she walks 10 x 5 = 50 miles during the weekdays. On her way back home, she walks 12 miles every afternoon from Monday to Friday. So, in total, she walks 12 x 5 = 60 miles during the weekdays. Therefore, the total distance Alice walks during the weekdays is 50 + 60 = 110 miles. Since the problem asks for the total distance Alice walks in a week, we need to add the distance she walks on Saturday and Sunday as well. Let's assume Alice doesn't walk to school on weekends. So, the total distance she walks on weekends is 0. Therefore, the total distance Alice walks in a week is 110 + 0 + 0 = 110 miles. The answer is 110.\n\n\nQ: Jerry works as an independent contractor for a company that pays him $40 per task. If each task takes him two hours to complete and he works 10 hours a day for a whole week, calculate the total amount of money he would earn at the end of the week.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many tasks Jerry can complete in a day. Since each task takes him two hours to complete, he can complete 10/2 = 5 tasks in a day. Next, we need to find out how many tasks Jerry can complete in a week. Since he works 10 hours a day for a whole week, he works a total of 10*7 = 70 hours in a week. Therefore, he can complete 70/2 = 35 tasks in a week. Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money Jerry would earn at the end of the week. Since he earns $40 per task, he would earn a total of 40*35 = $1400 at the end of the week. The answer is 1400.\n\n\n"
