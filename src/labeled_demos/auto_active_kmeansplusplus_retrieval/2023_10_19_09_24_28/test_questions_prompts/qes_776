  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Rachel makes $12.00 as a waitress in a coffee shop.  In one hour, she serves 20 different people and they all leave her a $1.25 tip.  How much money did she make in that hour?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how much money Rachel made from her hourly wage. Rachel makes $12.00 as a waitress in a coffee shop. Next, we need to calculate how much money Rachel made from tips. In one hour, she serves 20 different people and they all leave her a $1.25 tip. To calculate the tip money, we can multiply the number of people Rachel served by the amount of tip each person left her: 20 people x $1.25 tip = $25.00 Now, we can add the tip money to Rachel's hourly wage to find out how much money she made in that hour: $12.00 hourly wage + $25.00 tip money = $37.00 Therefore, Rachel made $37.00 in that hour. The answer is 37.\n\n\nQ: Marco has $24. Mary has $15. If Marco gives Mary half of what he has, Mary will have more than Marco. But Mary spends $5. How much more money does Mary have than Marco?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much money Marco gives to Mary. Since Marco has $24, half of that would be $12. So, Marco gives $12 to Mary. After receiving $12 from Marco, Mary will have $15 + $12 = $27. However, Mary spends $5, so we need to subtract that from her total. $27 - $5 = $22. Therefore, Mary has $22 more than Marco. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Each week Jaime saves $50. Every two weeks she spends $46 of her savings on a nice lunch with her mum. How long will it take her to save $135?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much money Jaime saves in a week after spending $46 every two weeks on lunch with her mom. In two weeks, Jaime spends $46 on lunch, so in one week, she spends $23 on lunch. Therefore, Jaime saves $50 - $23 = $27 per week. Next, we need to figure out how many weeks it will take Jaime to save $135. We can set up an equation: $27 per week x number of weeks = $135 To solve for the number of weeks, we can divide both sides by $27: number of weeks = $135 / $27 number of weeks = 5 Therefore, it will take Jaime 5 weeks to save $135. The answer is 135.\n\n\nQ: Yanna bought ten shirts at $5 each and three pairs of sandals at $3 each.  How much change did she get back if she gave a one hundred dollar bill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of the shirts. 10 shirts x $5 per shirt = $50 Next, let's calculate the total cost of the sandals. 3 pairs of sandals x $3 per pair = $9 Now, let's add the cost of the shirts and sandals together to find the total cost. $50 + $9 = $59 Yanna gave a $100 bill, so we need to subtract the total cost from $100 to find the change. $100 - $59 = $41 Therefore, Yanna received $41 in change. The answer is 41.\n\n\nQ: Samuel is going to the cinema with his brother, Kevin. They both have a total budget of $20 for their outing. Samuel buys his $14 ticket, then spends $6 on drinks and food. Kevin buys his ticket, then spends $2 on drinks. They have both used their entire budget. How much did Kevin spend on food?\nA: Let's think step by step. Samuel spent $14 on his ticket and $6 on food and drinks, which means he spent a total of $20. This means that Kevin must have spent $0 on food and drinks, since they both used their entire budget of $20. Therefore, Kevin spent $6 on his ticket and $2 on drinks, which means he spent a total of $8. Since he didn't spend any money on food, the answer is $0. The answer is 0.\n\n\nQ: Grant spends $200.00 a year to have the newspaper delivered daily to his house.  Juanita buys the newspaper daily.  Monday through Saturday, she spends $0.50 and on Sunday she spends $2.00.  How much more money does Juanita spend buying the newspaper yearly than Grant?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper daily from Monday to Saturday: $0.50 x 6 = $3.00 Now, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper on Sundays: $2.00 x 1 = $2.00 Next, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper weekly: $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00 Finally, let's calculate how much Juanita spends on the newspaper yearly: $5.00 x 52 = $260.00 Now, let's calculate the difference between what Juanita spends and what Grant spends: $260.00 - $200.00 = $60.00 Therefore, Juanita spends $60.00 more buying the newspaper yearly than Grant. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Mrs. Thomson received an incentive worth $240. She spent 1/3 of the money on food and 1/5 of it on clothes. Then, she put in her savings account 3/4 of the remaining money. How much money did Mrs. Thomson save?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Mrs. Thomson spent on food. We know that she spent 1/3 of the $240 incentive on food, so we can calculate: 1/3 x $240 = $80 Next, we need to find out how much money she spent on clothes. We know that she spent 1/5 of the $240 incentive on clothes, so we can calculate: 1/5 x $240 = $48 To find out how much money she had left after spending on food and clothes, we need to subtract the amounts she spent from the total incentive: $240 - $80 - $48 = $112 Now we know that Mrs. Thomson had $112 left. She put 3/4 of this amount into her savings account, so we can calculate: 3/4 x $112 = $84 Therefore, Mrs. Thomson saved $84. The answer is 84.\n\n\nQ: Maria's monthly salary is $2000. 20% of her salary goes to paying tax, and 5% goes to insurance. Also, a quarter of the money left after the deductions is spent on utility bills. How much money does Maria have after the deductions and utility bills payment?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money goes to tax and insurance. Tax: 20% of $2000 = 0.2 x $2000 = $400 Insurance: 5% of $2000 = 0.05 x $2000 = $100 Next, we need to subtract the total amount of tax and insurance from Maria's monthly salary to find out how much money she has left. $2000 - $400 - $100 = $1500 Now, we need to find out how much money Maria spends on utility bills. A quarter of $1500 = 0.25 x $1500 = $375 Finally, we need to subtract the amount spent on utility bills from the money Maria has left after the deductions. $1500 - $375 = $1125 Therefore, Maria has $1125 left after the deductions and utility bills payment. The answer is 1125.\n\n\n"
