  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Lucas wants to get a dog but his parents think he already has too many pets and won't have enough space. He already has 12 pet beds in his room but manages to fit another 8 pet beds. His parents argue that each pet is going to need 2 beds each to feel comfortable. According to his parent's argument, how many pets does Lucas have enough room for?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pet beds Lucas has in total after adding the 8 new ones. 12 + 8 = 20 pet beds Next, we need to divide the total number of pet beds by 2 to find out how many pets can be accommodated. 20 \u00f7 2 = 10 pets Therefore, according to his parent's argument, Lucas has enough room for 10 pets. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Junior has 16 rabbits. On Monday, he bought 6 toys for his rabbits. On Wednesday, he bought twice as many toys as he did Monday. On Friday, he bought four times as many toys as he did on Monday, and on the next day he bought half as many toys as he did on Wednesday. If he split all the toys evenly between the rabbits, how many toys would each rabbit have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many toys Junior bought on Wednesday and Friday. On Wednesday, he bought twice as many toys as he did on Monday, so he bought 6 x 2 = 12 toys. On Friday, he bought four times as many toys as he did on Monday, so he bought 6 x 4 = 24 toys. Next, we need to find out how many toys he bought on Saturday. On Saturday, he bought half as many toys as he did on Wednesday, so he bought 12 / 2 = 6 toys. Now, we can add up all the toys he bought: 6 + 12 + 24 + 6 = 48 toys Junior has 16 rabbits, so if he splits the toys evenly between them, each rabbit will have: 48 toys / 16 rabbits = 3 toys per rabbit. Therefore, each rabbit will have 3 toys. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Jeff has a shelter where he currently takes care of 20 cats. On Monday he found 2 kittens in a box and took them to the shelter. On Tuesday he found 1 more cat with a leg injury. On Wednesday 3 people adopted 2 cats each. How many cats does Jeff currently have in his shelter?\nA: Let's think step by step. Jeff had 20 cats in his shelter. On Monday he found 2 kittens and took them to the shelter, so he now has 20 + 2 = 22 cats. On Tuesday he found 1 more cat with a leg injury, so he now has 22 + 1 = 23 cats. On Wednesday, 3 people adopted 2 cats each, which means a total of 3 x 2 = 6 cats were adopted. Therefore, Jeff currently has 23 - 6 = 17 cats in his shelter. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Willy has 10 stuffed animals. His mom gives him 2 more stuffed animals for his birthday. After his birthday, if his dad gives him 3 times more stuffed animals than he has, how many stuffed animals does Willy have in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to add the 2 stuffed animals that Willy received from his mom to the 10 he already had: 10 + 2 = 12 Now we know that Willy has 12 stuffed animals. Next, we need to figure out how many stuffed animals Willy's dad gave him. We know that his dad gave him 3 times more stuffed animals than he already had, so we can multiply 12 by 3: 12 x 3 = 36 So Willy's dad gave him 36 stuffed animals. Finally, we can add the 12 stuffed animals Willy already had to the 36 his dad gave him: 12 + 36 = 48 Therefore, Willy has a total of 48 stuffed animals. The answer is 48.\n\n\nQ: Sally, Sam, and Steve went to play with their marbles. In the beginning, Sam has twice as many marbles as Steve while Sally has 5 less than Sam. After Sam has given Sally and Steve 3 marbles each, Sam has 8 marbles left. How many marbles does Steve have now?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Sam had in the beginning. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve, so let's call the number of marbles Steve had \"x\". This means that Sam had 2x marbles. Next, we know that Sally had 5 less marbles than Sam, so Sally had 2x - 5 marbles. After Sam gave 3 marbles each to Sally and Steve, he was left with 8 marbles. This means that he gave away a total of 6 marbles (3 to Sally and 3 to Steve), so he must have started with 14 marbles (8 + 6 = 14). Now we can use this information to figure out how many marbles Steve has. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve in the beginning, so if Sam had 14 marbles, Steve must have had 7 marbles (14 \u00f7 2 = 7). After Sam gave Steve 3 marbles, Steve now has 10 marbles (7 + 3 = 10). The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Adam has just bought some new books so he has decided to clean up his bookcase. After he adds his new books to his bookshelf he realizes that he has bought enough books to finish completely filling his bookcase with 2 books left over. Before his shopping trip, Adam had 56 books in his bookcase. If his bookcase has 4 shelves and averages 20 books per shelf, how many books did Adam buy on his shopping trip?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many books can fit on Adam's bookcase. We know that he has 4 shelves and each shelf can hold an average of 20 books, so the total capacity of his bookcase is: 4 shelves x 20 books per shelf = 80 books Next, we need to figure out how many books Adam had before his shopping trip. We know that he had 56 books in his bookcase before he bought any new books. Now, we can use the information given in the problem to figure out how many books Adam bought on his shopping trip. We know that he bought enough books to completely fill his bookcase with 2 books left over. This means that he bought: 80 books - 2 books left over = 78 books Therefore, Adam bought 78 books on his shopping trip. The answer is 78.\n\n\nQ: Melody has three dogs. Each dog eats 1/2 of a pound of dog food twice a day. If Melody bought 30 pounds of dog food, how many pounds of dog food are left after a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much dog food each dog eats in a day. Since each dog eats 1/2 of a pound of dog food twice a day, each dog eats a total of 1 pound of dog food per day (1/2 + 1/2 = 1). So, three dogs would eat a total of 3 pounds of dog food per day (3 x 1 = 3). In a week, which is 7 days, the dogs would eat a total of 21 pounds of dog food (3 x 7 = 21). If Melody bought 30 pounds of dog food and the dogs ate 21 pounds in a week, then there would be 9 pounds of dog food left (30 - 21 = 9). Therefore, after a week, Melody would have 9 pounds of dog food left. The answer is 9.\n\n\n"
