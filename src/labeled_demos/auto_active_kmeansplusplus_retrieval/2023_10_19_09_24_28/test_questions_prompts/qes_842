  "test_question": "Q: Tyler wants to buy a dictionary that costs $18, a dinosaur book that costs $13, and a children's cookbook that costs $8. He has saved $14 from his allowance. If Tyler earns $5 per hour, how many hours does he have to work to afford his books?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Oliver had $9, then he saved $5 from his allowance and spent $4 on a frisbee and $3 on a puzzle. His friend gives him another $8 as it's his birthday. How much money does Oliver have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. Oliver had $9. He saved $5 from his allowance, so he now has $9 + $5 = $14. He spent $4 on a frisbee, so he now has $14 - $4 = $10. He spent another $3 on a puzzle, so he now has $10 - $3 = $7. His friend gives him another $8, so he now has $7 + $8 = $15. Therefore, Oliver has $15 left. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Jerry works as an independent contractor for a company that pays him $40 per task. If each task takes him two hours to complete and he works 10 hours a day for a whole week, calculate the total amount of money he would earn at the end of the week.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many tasks Jerry can complete in a day. Since each task takes him two hours to complete, he can complete 10/2 = 5 tasks in a day. Next, we need to find out how many tasks Jerry can complete in a week. Since he works 10 hours a day for a whole week, he works a total of 10*7 = 70 hours in a week. Therefore, he can complete 70/2 = 35 tasks in a week. Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money Jerry would earn at the end of the week. Since he earns $40 per task, he would earn a total of 40*35 = $1400 at the end of the week. The answer is 1400.\n\n\nQ: Whitney\u2019s mom gave her two $20 bills to spend at the school book fair. Whitney has decided to buy 2 posters, 3 notebooks, and 2 bookmarks. Each poster costs $5, each notebook costs $4, and each bookmark costs $2. How much money, in dollars, will Whitney have left over after the purchase?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of the posters. Whitney is buying 2 posters, and each poster costs $5, so the total cost of the posters is 2 x $5 = $10. Next, let's calculate the total cost of the notebooks. Whitney is buying 3 notebooks, and each notebook costs $4, so the total cost of the notebooks is 3 x $4 = $12. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the bookmarks. Whitney is buying 2 bookmarks, and each bookmark costs $2, so the total cost of the bookmarks is 2 x $2 = $4. Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Whitney is buying: $10 + $12 + $4 = $26. Whitney started with two $20 bills, which is a total of $40. After spending $26 on the posters, notebooks, and bookmarks, she will have $40 - $26 = $14 left over. Therefore, Whitney will have $14 left over after the purchase. The answer is 14.\n\n\nQ: To buy a book, you pay $20 for each of the first 5 books at the supermarket, and for each additional book you buy over $20, you receive a discount of $2. If Beatrice bought 20 books, how much did she pay at the supermarket?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the first 5 books, which is simply: $20 x 5 = $100 Next, we need to calculate the cost of the remaining 15 books. Since Beatrice gets a $2 discount for each book over $20, we can calculate the cost of each book as: $20 - $2 = $18 Therefore, the cost of the remaining 15 books is: $18 x 15 = $270 Finally, we can calculate the total cost by adding the cost of the first 5 books to the cost of the remaining 15 books: $100 + $270 = $370 Therefore, Beatrice paid $370 at the supermarket for 20 books. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Doris earns $20 per hour by babysitting. She needs to earn at least $1200 for her monthly expenses. She can babysit for 3 hours every weekday and 5 hours on a Saturday.  How many weeks does it take for Doris to earn enough to cover her monthly expenses?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much Doris earns per week by babysitting. She babysits for 3 hours every weekday, which is a total of 15 hours per week (3 hours x 5 days). She also babysits for 5 hours on a Saturday, which adds another 5 hours to her weekly total. So, in total, she babysits for 20 hours per week. If she earns $20 per hour, then she earns 20 x 20 = $400 per week. To cover her monthly expenses of $1200, she needs to earn 1200 / 400 = 3 weeks of babysitting. Therefore, it takes Doris 3 weeks to earn enough to cover her monthly expenses. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how much money Carl will earn in four weeks. If he earns $0.50 every time, and he buys a candy bar each time, that means he's spending $0.50 each week. But he's also earning $0.75 each week for taking out his neighbor's trash. So his net earnings each week are $0.75 - $0.50 = $0.25. Over four weeks, that's a total of $0.25 x 4 = $1. So Carl will have $1 to spend on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.50, he can buy 2 candy bars with his earnings. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Billy has 8 hours of free time on each day of the weekend. He wants to spend 75% of his time playing video games and the rest of his time reading. He can read 60 pages an hour and his books all contain 80 pages. How many books does he read?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts. First, we need to find out how much time Billy spends playing video games and how much time he spends reading. He has 8 hours of free time on each day of the weekend, so that's a total of 16 hours for the entire weekend. If he wants to spend 75% of his time playing video games, that means he will spend 0.75 x 16 = 12 hours playing video games. The rest of his time will be spent reading, which is 16 - 12 = 4 hours. Next, we need to find out how many pages he can read in 1 hour. We know that he can read 60 pages an hour, so that's 60 pages/hour. Finally, we need to find out how many books he can read in 4 hours. Each book contains 80 pages, so he can read 60/80 = 0.75 of a book in 1 hour. In 4 hours, he can read 4 x 0.75 = 3 books. Therefore, Billy can read 3 books during his free time on the weekend. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Logan makes $65,000 a year. He spends $20,000 on rent every year, $5000 on groceries every year, and $8000 on gas every year. If he wants to have at least $42000 left, how much more money must he make each year?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how much Logan spends in total each year: $20,000 (rent) + $5,000 (groceries) + $8,000 (gas) = $33,000 Next, we need to subtract that amount from his annual income: $65,000 (income) - $33,000 (expenses) = $32,000 So Logan currently has $32,000 left after paying his expenses. However, he wants to have at least $42,000 left. Therefore, we need to calculate how much more money he needs to make each year: $42,000 (desired savings) - $32,000 (current savings) = $10,000 Therefore, Logan needs to make at least $10,000 more each year to reach his desired savings goal. The answer is 10000.\n\n\n"
