  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Jim has 2 rows of 4 trees to start.  When he turns 10 he decides to plant a new row of trees every year on his birthday.  On his 15th birthday after he doubles the number of trees he has.  How many trees does he have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller steps. Step 1: Jim starts with 2 rows of 4 trees each, so he has a total of 2 x 4 = 8 trees. Step 2: Jim plants a new row of trees every year on his birthday, starting from his 10th birthday. So, he plants trees for 15 - 10 = 5 years. Step 3: In these 5 years, Jim plants 5 new rows of trees, one row each year. Step 4: Therefore, Jim now has a total of 2 + 5 = 7 rows of trees. Step 5: Each row has 4 trees, so Jim has a total of 7 x 4 = 28 trees. Step 6: On his 15th birthday, Jim doubles the number of trees he has. So, he now has 28 x 2 = 56 trees. Therefore, Jim has 56 trees after he doubles the number of trees he has on his 15th birthday. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: When it rains, the three holes in the garage roof leak water at different rates.  The largest hole leaks at a rate of 3 ounces of water  per minute.  The medium-sized hole leaks water at one-half the rate of the largest hole.  And the smallest hole leaks water at a rate of one-third the rate of the medium-sized hole.  When it rains, what is the combined amount of water, in ounces, that leak from all three holes over a 2-hour time period?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the rate at which the medium-sized hole leaks water. We know that it leaks at one-half the rate of the largest hole, which is 3 ounces per minute. So, the medium-sized hole leaks at a rate of 3/2 = 1.5 ounces per minute. Next, we need to find the rate at which the smallest hole leaks water. We know that it leaks at a rate of one-third the rate of the medium-sized hole, which is 1.5/3 = 0.5 ounces per minute. Now, we can find the total amount of water that leaks from all three holes in one minute. We add up the rates of all three holes: 3 + 1.5 + 0.5 = 5 ounces per minute. Finally, we can find the total amount of water that leaks from all three holes over a 2-hour time period (which is 120 minutes). We multiply the total rate by the time: 5 x 120 = 600 ounces. Therefore, the combined amount of water that leaks from all three holes over a 2-hour time period is 600 ounces. The answer is 600.\n\n\nQ: It takes Omar 12 minutes to raise his kite 240 feet into the air. Jasper can raise his kite at three times the rate of speed as Omar can raise his kite. If Jasper raises his kite to a height of 600 feet, how many minutes will it take?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Jasper to raise his kite to a height of 240 feet, like Omar did. We know that Omar takes 12 minutes to raise his kite 240 feet, so we can set up a proportion: 12 minutes / 240 feet = x minutes / 600 feet To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 12 minutes * 600 feet = 240 feet * x minutes 7200 = 240x x = 30 So it would take Jasper 30 minutes to raise his kite to a height of 600 feet. The answer is 600.\n\n\nQ: There are four growing trees. The first tree grows 1 meter/day, the second grows the same amount in half the time, the third grows 2 meters/day, and the fourth tree grows a meter more than the third each day. How many meters did the trees grow in total in 4 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much the second tree grows per day. Since it grows the same amount as the first tree in half the time, it grows 2 meters/day. Now we can calculate how much each tree grows in 4 days: - The first tree grows 1 meter/day, so in 4 days it grows 4 meters. - The second tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The third tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The fourth tree grows 1 meter more than the third each day, so it grows 3 meters/day. In 4 days it grows 12 meters. Adding up the growth of all four trees, we get: 4 + 8 + 8 + 12 = 32 meters Therefore, the trees grew a total of 32 meters in 4 days. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: John can play 200 beats per minute.  If he plays 2 hours a day for 3 days how many beats does he play?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many minutes John plays in total. Since he plays for 2 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, he plays for 2 x 60 = 120 minutes per day. Therefore, over 3 days, he plays for a total of 120 x 3 = 360 minutes. Now we need to find out how many beats he plays in total. If he plays 200 beats per minute, then in 360 minutes he plays 200 x 360 = 72,000 beats. So John plays 72,000 beats over the course of 3 days. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: James and 4 of his friends volunteered to plant flowers. In 2 days, they were able to plant a total of 200 flowers. If each of them planted the same number of flowers, how many flowers did James plant in a day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people were planting flowers. We know that James and 4 of his friends volunteered, so there were 5 people in total. Next, we need to find out how many flowers each person planted in 2 days. To do this, we can divide the total number of flowers planted (200) by the number of people (5) and the number of days (2): 200 \u00f7 5 \u00f7 2 = 20 So each person planted 20 flowers in 2 days. Finally, we need to find out how many flowers James planted in 1 day. Since each person planted 20 flowers in 2 days, we can divide that by 2 to find out how many flowers each person planted in 1 day: 20 \u00f7 2 = 10 Therefore, James planted 10 flowers in 1 day. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Don can paint 3 tiles a minute, Ken can paint 2 more tiles a minute than Don and Laura can paint twice as many tiles as Ken. Kim can paint 3 fewer tiles than Laura can in a minute. How many tiles can Don, Ken, Laura and Kim paint in 15 minutes?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many tiles each person can paint in one minute. Don can paint 3 tiles a minute. Ken can paint 2 more tiles a minute than Don, so Ken can paint 3 + 2 = 5 tiles a minute. Laura can paint twice as many tiles as Ken, so Laura can paint 5 x 2 = 10 tiles a minute. Kim can paint 3 fewer tiles than Laura can in a minute, so Kim can paint 10 - 3 = 7 tiles a minute. Now that we know how many tiles each person can paint in one minute, we can multiply that by 15 to find out how many tiles they can paint in 15 minutes. Don can paint 3 x 15 = 45 tiles in 15 minutes. Ken can paint 5 x 15 = 75 tiles in 15 minutes. Laura can paint 10 x 15 = 150 tiles in 15 minutes. Kim can paint 7 x 15 = 105 tiles in 15 minutes. Therefore, Don can paint 45 tiles, Ken can paint 75 tiles, Laura can paint 150 tiles, and Kim can paint 105 tiles in 15 minutes. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: For homework, Brooke has 15 math problems, 6 social studies problems, and 10 science problems. He can answer each math problem for 2 minutes while answering each social studies problem takes him 30 seconds. If he can answer each science problem in 1.5 minutes, how long will it take Brooke to answer all his homework?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total time Brooke needs to answer all the math problems: 15 math problems x 2 minutes per problem = 30 minutes Next, let's calculate the total time Brooke needs to answer all the social studies problems: 6 social studies problems x 30 seconds per problem = 3 minutes Note that we converted the time to minutes since the time for math problems is given in minutes. Finally, let's calculate the total time Brooke needs to answer all the science problems: 10 science problems x 1.5 minutes per problem = 15 minutes Now, we can add up the time for each subject to get the total time Brooke needs to answer all his homework: 30 minutes (math) + 3 minutes (social studies) + 15 minutes (science) = 48 minutes Therefore, it will take Brooke 48 minutes to answer all his homework. The answer is 48.\n\n\n"
