  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Tatuya, Ivanna, and Dorothy took a quiz together. Tatuya scored twice as much as Ivanna, and Ivanna scored 3/5 times as many marks as Dorothy. If Dorothy scored 90 marks, calculate the average marks scored by the three.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many marks Ivanna scored. We know that Ivanna scored 3/5 times as many marks as Dorothy, who scored 90 marks. So Ivanna scored: 3/5 * 90 = 54 marks Next, we need to find out how many marks Tatuya scored. We know that Tatuya scored twice as much as Ivanna, who scored 54 marks. So Tatuya scored: 2 * 54 = 108 marks Now we can find the total marks scored by the three of them: 90 + 54 + 108 = 252 marks Finally, we can calculate the average marks scored by the three: 252 / 3 = 84 marks Therefore, the average marks scored by Tatuya, Ivanna, and Dorothy is 84 marks. The answer is 84.\n\n\nQ: In the Golden State Team, each player earned points. Draymond earned 12 points, Curry earned twice the points as Draymond, Kelly earned 9, Durant earned twice the points as Kelly, Klay earned half the points as Draymond. How many points did the Golden States have in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. Draymond earned 12 points. Curry earned twice the points as Draymond, which is 2 x 12 = 24 points. Kelly earned 9 points. Durant earned twice the points as Kelly, which is 2 x 9 = 18 points. Klay earned half the points as Draymond, which is 1/2 x 12 = 6 points. To find the total points earned by the Golden State team, we add up all the points earned by each player: 12 + 24 + 9 + 18 + 6 = 69 points. Therefore, the Golden State team earned a total of 69 points. The answer is 69.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Frankie and Carla played 30 games of ping pong against each other.  Frankie won half as many games as did Carla.  How many games did Carla win?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can start by using algebra to represent the problem. Let's say that Carla won x number of games. Then, we know that Frankie won half as many games as Carla, which means Frankie won (1/2)x games. Next, we know that they played a total of 30 games, so we can set up an equation: x + (1/2)x = 30 We can simplify this equation by combining like terms: (3/2)x = 30 To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/2, which is 2/3: x = (2/3) * 30 x = 20 Therefore, Carla won 20 games. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Mona plays a multiplayer video game on the weekends. She joins groups with four other players to complete objectives in the game. The past weekend, she joined 9 groups. One of the groups included two players she had grouped with before that weekend, and another group included one person she had grouped with before. How many unique players did Mona group with on the video game that weekend?\nA: Let's think step by step. Mona joined 9 groups in total. Out of these 9 groups, one group included two players she had grouped with before. So, we can count these two players only once. Similarly, another group included one person she had grouped with before. So, we can count this person only once as well. Therefore, the number of unique players Mona grouped with on the video game that weekend would be: 9 groups - 1 group with 2 repeat players - 1 group with 1 repeat player = 7 unique players. So, Mona grouped with 7 unique players on the video game that weekend. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Theresa has 5 more than thrice as many video games as Julia. Julia has a third as many video games as Tory. If Tory has 6 video games, how many video games does Theresa have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many video games Julia has. We know that Julia has a third as many video games as Tory, who has 6 video games. So, Julia has 6/3 = 2 video games. Next, we need to find out how many video games Theresa has. We know that Theresa has 5 more than thrice as many video games as Julia. So, we can write an equation: Theresa's video games = 5 + 3 * Julia's video games Substituting Julia's video games with 2, we get: Theresa's video games = 5 + 3 * 2 Theresa's video games = 11 Therefore, Theresa has 11 video games. The answer is 11.\n\n\nQ: Ivan has 20 dice. Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. How many dice do they have altogether?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Ivan has 20 dice. Next, we know that Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. So, we can multiply Ivan's number of dice by 2 to find Jerry's number of dice: 20 x 2 = 40 Therefore, Jerry has 40 dice. To find the total number of dice they have altogether, we can add Ivan's and Jerry's number of dice: 20 + 40 = 60 Therefore, they have 60 dice altogether. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Lewis found 4 more items on the scavenger hunt than Samantha.  Samantha found four times the amount of items than Tanya who was only able to find 4 items.  How many items did Lewis find?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many items Samantha found. We know that Samantha found four times the amount of items than Tanya, who found 4 items. So Samantha found 4 x 4 = 16 items. Next, we know that Lewis found 4 more items than Samantha. So we can add 4 to Samantha's total: 16 + 4 = 20. Therefore, Lewis found 20 items on the scavenger hunt. The answer is 20.\n\n\n"
