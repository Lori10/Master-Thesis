  "test_question": "Q: Mark plants a beanstalk below his second-story window, which is 20 feet off the ground. The beanstalk doubles its height every day. If the beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall, how many days will it take to be taller than Mark's window?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: There are four growing trees. The first tree grows 1 meter/day, the second grows the same amount in half the time, the third grows 2 meters/day, and the fourth tree grows a meter more than the third each day. How many meters did the trees grow in total in 4 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much the second tree grows per day. Since it grows the same amount as the first tree in half the time, it grows 2 meters/day. Now we can calculate how much each tree grows in 4 days: - The first tree grows 1 meter/day, so in 4 days it grows 4 meters. - The second tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The third tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The fourth tree grows 1 meter more than the third each day, so it grows 3 meters/day. In 4 days it grows 12 meters. Adding up the growth of all four trees, we get: 4 + 8 + 8 + 12 = 32 meters Therefore, the trees grew a total of 32 meters in 4 days. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Jim has 2 rows of 4 trees to start.  When he turns 10 he decides to plant a new row of trees every year on his birthday.  On his 15th birthday after he doubles the number of trees he has.  How many trees does he have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller steps. Step 1: Jim starts with 2 rows of 4 trees each, so he has a total of 2 x 4 = 8 trees. Step 2: Jim plants a new row of trees every year on his birthday, starting from his 10th birthday. So, he plants trees for 15 - 10 = 5 years. Step 3: In these 5 years, Jim plants 5 new rows of trees, one row each year. Step 4: Therefore, Jim now has a total of 2 + 5 = 7 rows of trees. Step 5: Each row has 4 trees, so Jim has a total of 7 x 4 = 28 trees. Step 6: On his 15th birthday, Jim doubles the number of trees he has. So, he now has 28 x 2 = 56 trees. Therefore, Jim has 56 trees after he doubles the number of trees he has on his 15th birthday. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: James and 4 of his friends volunteered to plant flowers. In 2 days, they were able to plant a total of 200 flowers. If each of them planted the same number of flowers, how many flowers did James plant in a day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people were planting flowers. We know that James and 4 of his friends volunteered, so there were 5 people in total. Next, we need to find out how many flowers each person planted in 2 days. To do this, we can divide the total number of flowers planted (200) by the number of people (5) and the number of days (2): 200 \u00f7 5 \u00f7 2 = 20 So each person planted 20 flowers in 2 days. Finally, we need to find out how many flowers James planted in 1 day. Since each person planted 20 flowers in 2 days, we can divide that by 2 to find out how many flowers each person planted in 1 day: 20 \u00f7 2 = 10 Therefore, James planted 10 flowers in 1 day. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Tropical Storm Sally brings 3 days of rain to southern Texas.  The first day it rained 4 inches.  The second day it rained 5 times as much as the first day, and the third day it rained 6 inches less than the sum of the first two days.  How much did it rain on the third day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First day: 4 inches Second day: 5 times as much as the first day = 5 x 4 = 20 inches Third day: 6 inches less than the sum of the first two days = (4 + 20) - 6 = 18 inches Therefore, it rained 18 inches on the third day. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: Dane\u2019s two daughters need to plant 5 flowers each to grow a garden. As the days passed, the flowers grew into 20 more but 10 of them died. Dane\u2019s daughters harvested the flowers and split them between 5 different baskets. How many flowers ended up in each basket?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many flowers were in the garden before the 20 grew and 10 died. Dane's two daughters planted 5 flowers each, so they planted a total of 2 x 5 = 10 flowers. After the flowers grew, there were 10 + 20 = 30 flowers in the garden. But then 10 of them died, so there were 30 - 10 = 20 flowers left. Finally, the 20 flowers were split between 5 baskets, so each basket had 20 / 5 = 4 flowers. Therefore, each basket ended up with 4 flowers. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: An apple tree produces 40 apples in its first year.  The second year the apple tree produces 8 more than double the amount of apples that it produced the first year, and the third year production went down by a fourth due to an insect infestation.  How many apples did the tree produce in total in the first three years?\nA: Let's think step by step. First year: 40 apples Second year: 8 more than double the amount of apples produced in the first year Double the amount of apples produced in the first year: 40 x 2 = 80 apples 8 more than double the amount of apples produced in the first year: 80 + 8 = 88 apples Third year: production went down by a fourth due to an insect infestation One fourth of the second year's production: 88 / 4 = 22 apples Third year's production: 88 - 22 = 66 apples Total production in the first three years: 40 + 88 + 66 = 194 apples. Therefore, the apple tree produced 194 apples in total in the first three years. The answer is 194.\n\n\nQ: It takes Omar 12 minutes to raise his kite 240 feet into the air. Jasper can raise his kite at three times the rate of speed as Omar can raise his kite. If Jasper raises his kite to a height of 600 feet, how many minutes will it take?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Jasper to raise his kite to a height of 240 feet, like Omar did. We know that Omar takes 12 minutes to raise his kite 240 feet, so we can set up a proportion: 12 minutes / 240 feet = x minutes / 600 feet To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 12 minutes * 600 feet = 240 feet * x minutes 7200 = 240x x = 30 So it would take Jasper 30 minutes to raise his kite to a height of 600 feet. The answer is 600.\n\n\nQ: Madeline wants to plant 20 flowers in her garden. She assumes that about half of the seeds she plants will die before they bloom. However, the flower shop only sells packs of seeds with 25 seeds per pack. Each pack is $5. How much will Madeline spend on seeds to plant 20 flowers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many seeds Madeline needs to plant 20 flowers. Since she assumes that about half of the seeds will die, she needs to plant twice as many seeds as the number of flowers she wants. Therefore, she needs to plant 20 x 2 = 40 seeds. Next, we need to figure out how many packs of seeds Madeline needs to buy. Since each pack contains 25 seeds, she needs to buy 40 / 25 = 1.6 packs of seeds. Since she can't buy a fraction of a pack, she needs to round up to the nearest whole pack. Therefore, she needs to buy 2 packs of seeds. Finally, we need to figure out how much Madeline will spend on seeds. Since each pack costs $5 and she needs to buy 2 packs, she will spend 5 x 2 = $10 on seeds. Therefore, Madeline will spend $10 on seeds to plant 20 flowers. The answer is 20.\n\n\n"
