  "test_question": "Q: Generally, a 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits, a 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, a 7-year-old one produces 7 times the initial amount, and an 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit, and then a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits. How many total fruits can an avocado tree produce during its 10 years of life?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: An apple tree produces 40 apples in its first year.  The second year the apple tree produces 8 more than double the amount of apples that it produced the first year, and the third year production went down by a fourth due to an insect infestation.  How many apples did the tree produce in total in the first three years?\nA: Let's think step by step. First year: 40 apples Second year: 8 more than double the amount of apples produced in the first year Double the amount of apples produced in the first year: 40 x 2 = 80 apples 8 more than double the amount of apples produced in the first year: 80 + 8 = 88 apples Third year: production went down by a fourth due to an insect infestation One fourth of the second year's production: 88 / 4 = 22 apples Third year's production: 88 - 22 = 66 apples Total production in the first three years: 40 + 88 + 66 = 194 apples. Therefore, the apple tree produced 194 apples in total in the first three years. The answer is 194.\n\n\nQ: A tomato plant has 100 tomatoes. Jane picks 1/4 of that number for use in their house. After a week, she goes back and picks 20 more tomatoes, and the following week picks twice that number. What's the total number of fruits remaining on the tomato plant?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Jane picks 1/4 of 100 tomatoes, which is 25 tomatoes. So, there are 100 - 25 = 75 tomatoes left on the plant. After a week, Jane picks 20 more tomatoes, so there are 75 - 20 = 55 tomatoes left on the plant. The following week, Jane picks twice the number of tomatoes she picked the previous week, which is 2 * 20 = 40 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes Jane picked is 25 + 20 + 40 = 85 tomatoes. The total number of tomatoes remaining on the plant is 100 - 85 = 15 tomatoes. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Jim has 2 rows of 4 trees to start.  When he turns 10 he decides to plant a new row of trees every year on his birthday.  On his 15th birthday after he doubles the number of trees he has.  How many trees does he have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller steps. Step 1: Jim starts with 2 rows of 4 trees each, so he has a total of 2 x 4 = 8 trees. Step 2: Jim plants a new row of trees every year on his birthday, starting from his 10th birthday. So, he plants trees for 15 - 10 = 5 years. Step 3: In these 5 years, Jim plants 5 new rows of trees, one row each year. Step 4: Therefore, Jim now has a total of 2 + 5 = 7 rows of trees. Step 5: Each row has 4 trees, so Jim has a total of 7 x 4 = 28 trees. Step 6: On his 15th birthday, Jim doubles the number of trees he has. So, he now has 28 x 2 = 56 trees. Therefore, Jim has 56 trees after he doubles the number of trees he has on his 15th birthday. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Vicente saw Sophie's mom giving Sophie 20 oranges every day to carry to school to eat. He also saw Hannah's dad giving Hannah 40 grapes every day to eat at the school. If he counted the number of fruits that the girls were given for 30 days, calculate the total number of fruits that Sophie and Hannah had eaten in the 30 days.\nA: Let's think step by step. Sophie was given 20 oranges every day for 30 days, so the total number of oranges she received is: 20 oranges/day x 30 days = 600 oranges Similarly, Hannah was given 40 grapes every day for 30 days, so the total number of grapes she received is: 40 grapes/day x 30 days = 1200 grapes Therefore, the total number of fruits that Sophie and Hannah had eaten in the 30 days is: 600 oranges + 1200 grapes = 1800 fruits The answer is 1800.\n\n\nQ: Last night Kannon had 3 apples, a banana, and 4 oranges for dinner. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, and twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today. How many fruits would she have eaten so far in the two meals?\nA: Let's think step by step. Last night Kannon had 3 apples, 1 banana, and 4 oranges, so she had a total of 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 fruits. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, which means she will have 3 + 4 = 7 apples today. She is also planning to have 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, which means she will have 1 x 10 = 10 bananas today. Finally, she is planning to have twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today, which means she will have 7 x 2 = 14 oranges today. Therefore, in total, Kannon will have eaten 7 + 10 + 14 = 31 fruits in the two meals. The answer is 31.\n\n\nQ: Tania has five baskets containing a total of 58 fruits. There are 18 mangoes in one basket, 10 pears in another, 12 pawpaws in another and the last 2 contain the same number of kiwi and lemon respectively, how many lemons are there?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of fruits in the three baskets that are not kiwi or lemon. 18 + 10 + 12 = 40 So, there are 40 fruits in those three baskets. Next, we need to find the total number of fruits in all five baskets. If there are 58 fruits in total, and 40 of them are in the three baskets we just added up, then the remaining two baskets must contain: 58 - 40 = 18 fruits We know that one of those baskets contains kiwi and the other contains lemon, and they have the same number of fruits. So, we can divide the remaining 18 fruits by 2 to get: 18 / 2 = 9 Therefore, there are 9 lemons in the basket with lemon. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: A fruit basket consists of 4 bananas, 3 apples, 24 strawberries, 2 avocados, and a bunch of grapes. One banana costs $1. An apple costs $2. 12 strawberries cost $4. An avocado costs $3, and half a bunch of grapes costs $2. What is the total cost of the fruit basket?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the bananas. Since one banana costs $1 and there are 4 bananas in the basket, the total cost of the bananas is 4 x $1 = $4. Next, we need to calculate the cost of the apples. Since one apple costs $2 and there are 3 apples in the basket, the total cost of the apples is 3 x $2 = $6. Now, let's calculate the cost of the strawberries. We know that 12 strawberries cost $4, so we can calculate the cost of 24 strawberries by multiplying the cost of 12 strawberries by 2. Therefore, the total cost of the strawberries is 2 x $4 = $8. Moving on to the avocados, we know that one avocado costs $3 and there are 2 avocados in the basket. Therefore, the total cost of the avocados is 2 x $3 = $6. Finally, we need to calculate the cost of the grapes. We know that half a bunch of grapes costs $2, but we don't know how many grapes are in the basket. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact cost of the grapes. Adding up the costs of all the other fruits, we get: $4 (bananas) + $6 (apples) + $8 (strawberries) + $6 (avocados) = $24 Therefore, the total cost of the fruit basket is $24 plus the cost of the grapes. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: James has a small tree outside his window with 30 branches with 90 twigs per branch. 30% of the twigs sprout 4 leaves and the rest sprout 5 leaves. How many leaves are on the tree total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of twigs on the tree. We know that there are 30 branches with 90 twigs per branch, so: 30 branches x 90 twigs per branch = 2700 twigs Next, we need to find how many twigs sprout 4 leaves and how many sprout 5 leaves. We know that 30% of the twigs sprout 4 leaves, so: 30% of 2700 twigs = 0.3 x 2700 = 810 twigs sprout 4 leaves The remaining twigs sprout 5 leaves: 2700 twigs - 810 twigs = 1890 twigs sprout 5 leaves Now we can find the total number of leaves on the tree. Each twig that sprouts 4 leaves contributes 4 leaves, and each twig that sprouts 5 leaves contributes 5 leaves. So: 810 twigs x 4 leaves per twig = 3240 leaves from twigs that sprout 4 leaves 1890 twigs x 5 leaves per twig = 9450 leaves from twigs that sprout 5 leaves The total number of leaves on the tree is: 3240 leaves + 9450 leaves = 12690 leaves Therefore, there are 12690 leaves on the tree in total. The answer is 12690.\n\n\n"
