  "test_question": "Q: Alfie, the albatross, flies 400 kilometers every day.  If the circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers, how many days will it take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Francine drives 140km to work each day. If she does not go to work 3 days every week, find the total distance she drives to work for 4 weeks in kilometers.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days Francine goes to work in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 x 7 = 28 days. If Francine does not go to work 3 days every week, then she goes to work 7 - 3 = 4 days every week. So in 4 weeks, she goes to work 4 x 4 = 16 days. Now we can find the total distance she drives to work in 4 weeks by multiplying the distance she drives to work each day by the number of days she goes to work in 4 weeks. Total distance = 140 km/day x 16 days = 2240 km Therefore, Francine drives a total of 2240 kilometers to work in 4 weeks. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: To get to an island called \"Virgo\", Tom needs to travel by plane and then by boat. The plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, and the boat trip takes up to 2 hours. In how many hours is Tom able to get to the \"Virgo\" island?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long the plane trip is. We know that the plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, so we can set up an equation: plane trip = 4 * boat trip Since we know the boat trip takes 2 hours, we can substitute that in: plane trip = 4 * 2 plane trip = 8 So the plane trip is 8 hours. Now we just need to add the plane trip and the boat trip together to find the total time: total time = plane trip + boat trip total time = 8 + 2 total time = 10 So Tom is able to get to the \"Virgo\" island in 10 hours. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Every Monday to Friday morning, Alice walks 10 miles through a large grass field to get to school. To avoid the hot afternoon sun on her way home, she walks 12 miles through a forest. When she gets home on Friday, how many miles will she have walked that week?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. Alice walks 10 miles every morning from Monday to Friday. So, in total, she walks 10 x 5 = 50 miles during the weekdays. On her way back home, she walks 12 miles every afternoon from Monday to Friday. So, in total, she walks 12 x 5 = 60 miles during the weekdays. Therefore, the total distance Alice walks during the weekdays is 50 + 60 = 110 miles. Since the problem asks for the total distance Alice walks in a week, we need to add the distance she walks on Saturday and Sunday as well. Let's assume Alice doesn't walk to school on weekends. So, the total distance she walks on weekends is 0. Therefore, the total distance Alice walks in a week is 110 + 0 + 0 = 110 miles. The answer is 110.\n\n\nQ: It takes Omar 12 minutes to raise his kite 240 feet into the air. Jasper can raise his kite at three times the rate of speed as Omar can raise his kite. If Jasper raises his kite to a height of 600 feet, how many minutes will it take?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Jasper to raise his kite to a height of 240 feet, like Omar did. We know that Omar takes 12 minutes to raise his kite 240 feet, so we can set up a proportion: 12 minutes / 240 feet = x minutes / 600 feet To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 12 minutes * 600 feet = 240 feet * x minutes 7200 = 240x x = 30 So it would take Jasper 30 minutes to raise his kite to a height of 600 feet. The answer is 600.\n\n\nQ: Ezekiel hikes as a hobby. This past summer, he did a challenging three-day hike across 50 kilometers of wilderness. The first day, he covered 10 kilometers of steep mountainside. The second day was flatter and he was able to cover half the full hike distance. How many kilometers did he have to hike on the third day to finish the hike?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. On the first day, Ezekiel covered 10 kilometers. On the second day, he covered half of the full hike distance, which means he covered 50/2 = 25 kilometers. So far, he has covered a total of 10 + 25 = 35 kilometers. To finish the hike, he needs to cover a total of 50 kilometers. Therefore, he needs to hike 50 - 35 = 15 kilometers on the third day to finish the hike. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Albert has to run 99 meters in gym class. The track is 9 meters around. He has already run 6 times around it. Once he finishes, how many more complete laps will he have made around the track?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many meters Albert has already run. We know that he has run 6 times around the track, and the track is 9 meters around, so: 6 x 9 = 54 meters Albert has already run 54 meters. Next, we need to find out how many meters he still needs to run: 99 - 54 = 45 meters Now we need to figure out how many complete laps he can make with the remaining 45 meters. Since the track is 9 meters around, we can divide 45 by 9 to find out how many complete laps he can make: 45 \u00f7 9 = 5 Albert can make 5 more complete laps around the track once he finishes. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: James writes a comic every other day for 4 years. If there was no leap year, how many comics has he written?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days there are in 4 years. Since there are 365 days in a year, we can multiply 365 by 4 to get: 365 x 4 = 1460 days Next, we need to figure out how many comics James writes in every other day. Since he writes a comic every other day, we can divide the total number of days by 2 to get: 1460 / 2 = 730 comics Therefore, James has written 730 comics in 4 years if there was no leap year. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Richard starts walking from Cincinnati to New York City, which is 70 miles. Richards walks 20 miles the first day. The next day he walks 6 miles less than half as much as he walked the first day. He walks 10 miles the third day. How many miles further does Richard have to walk to be in New York City?\nA: Let's think step by step. On the first day, Richard walks 20 miles. On the second day, he walks 6 miles less than half as much as he walked the first day. Half of what he walked on the first day is 20/2 = 10 miles. So, he walks 10 - 6 = 4 miles on the second day. On the third day, he walks 10 miles. Therefore, the total distance Richard has walked so far is 20 + 4 + 10 = 34 miles. To reach New York City, which is 70 miles away, Richard still has to walk 70 - 34 = 36 miles further. The answer is 36.\n\n\n"
