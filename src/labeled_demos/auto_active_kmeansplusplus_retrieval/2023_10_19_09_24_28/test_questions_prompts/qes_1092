  "formatted_prompt": "Q: For homework, Juan's teacher asked everyone in the class, to write down the different types of transportation (cars, trucks, bicycles, skateboards etc) they saw on their way home that afternoon.  After school, Juan walked home and saw the following: 15 cars, 3 bicycles, 8 pickup trucks and 1 tricycle.  How many tires in total were there on the vehicles Juan saw?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine the number of tires on each type of vehicle. - Cars have 4 tires each, so 15 cars would have 15 x 4 = 60 tires. - Bicycles have 2 tires each, so 3 bicycles would have 3 x 2 = 6 tires. - Pickup trucks have 4 tires each, so 8 pickup trucks would have 8 x 4 = 32 tires. - A tricycle has 3 tires. To find the total number of tires, we add up the number of tires for each type of vehicle: 60 + 6 + 32 + 3 = 101 Therefore, Juan saw a total of 101 tires on the vehicles he saw on his way home. The answer is 101.\n\n\nQ: Dylan's mother is throwing a baby shower for her best friend. She is expecting 40 guests, of whom she has cleared the parking lot to park in to, leaving only her car and her husband's jeep in the parking lot. The 40 guests, though, arrive in only 10 cars that they park in the parking lot.  If each car has 4 wheels, how many car wheels are there in the parking lot, including both of Dylan's parent's car wheels?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many wheels the 10 cars have in total. Since each car has 4 wheels, we can multiply 10 by 4 to get: 10 x 4 = 40 So, the 10 cars have a total of 40 wheels. Next, we need to add the wheels of Dylan's parent's cars. Since we know they have one car and one jeep, we can calculate the total number of wheels by adding the number of wheels for each vehicle. A car has 4 wheels and a jeep has 4 wheels, so we can add: 4 + 4 = 8 Therefore, there are a total of 40 + 8 = 48 wheels in the parking lot, including both of Dylan's parent's car wheels. The answer is 48.\n\n\nQ: A car driving cross-country traveled 180 miles in 4 hours. At this rate of speed, how many miles further will the car travel in the next 3 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the car's speed in miles per hour (mph). To do this, we divide the distance traveled by the time taken: Speed = Distance \u00f7 Time Speed = 180 miles \u00f7 4 hours Speed = 45 mph Now that we know the car's speed, we can use it to calculate how far it will travel in the next 3 hours: Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time Distance = 45 mph \u00d7 3 hours Distance = 135 miles Therefore, the car will travel 135 miles further in the next 3 hours. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Ignatius owns 4 bicycles.  A friend of his owns different types of cycles, which have three times are many tires as Ignatius's bikes have. He has one unicycle, a tricycle, and the rest are bikes. How many bicycles does the friend own?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many tires Ignatius's bikes have. Since each bike has two tires, Ignatius's bikes have a total of 4 x 2 = 8 tires. Next, we need to find out how many tires the friend's cycles have. We know that the friend's cycles have three times as many tires as Ignatius's bikes, so the friend's cycles have a total of 8 x 3 = 24 tires. We also know that the friend has one unicycle and one tricycle, which have a total of 1 + 3 = 4 tires. Therefore, the friend's bicycles must have a total of 24 - 4 = 20 tires. Since each bike has two tires, the friend must have a total of 20 / 2 = 10 bicycles. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Carson runs a carpool for five of his friends. The five of them cover all the gas expenses to compensate Carson for his time. Their total commute is 21 miles one way, gas costs $2.50/gallon, Carson's car gets 30 miles/gallon, and they commute to work 5 days a week, 4 weeks a month. How much does each person pay toward gas monthly?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per day. Since they commute 21 miles one way, their round trip is 21 x 2 = 42 miles. Next, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per week. They commute 42 miles per day, and they commute 5 days a week, so they commute 42 x 5 = 210 miles per week. Then, we need to find out how many miles they commute in total per month. They commute 210 miles per week, and they commute 4 weeks a month, so they commute 210 x 4 = 840 miles per month. Now, we need to find out how many gallons of gas they need per month. Carson's car gets 30 miles per gallon, and they commute 840 miles per month, so they need 840/30 = 28 gallons of gas per month. Finally, we need to find out how much each person pays toward gas monthly. The total cost of gas is $2.50 per gallon, and they need 28 gallons of gas per month, so the total cost of gas is 2.5 x 28 = $70 per month. Since there are 6 people in the carpool (Carson and his 5 friends), each person pays 70/6 = $11.67 toward gas monthly. The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: Francine drives 140km to work each day. If she does not go to work 3 days every week, find the total distance she drives to work for 4 weeks in kilometers.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days Francine goes to work in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 x 7 = 28 days. If Francine does not go to work 3 days every week, then she goes to work 7 - 3 = 4 days every week. So in 4 weeks, she goes to work 4 x 4 = 16 days. Now we can find the total distance she drives to work in 4 weeks by multiplying the distance she drives to work each day by the number of days she goes to work in 4 weeks. Total distance = 140 km/day x 16 days = 2240 km Therefore, Francine drives a total of 2240 kilometers to work in 4 weeks. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Danny helps his friends carpool to work. He has to drive 8 miles to the first friend's house, half that distance to the second friend's house, then 3 times the total distance driven so far to get to work. How many miles does Danny drive between the second friend's house and work?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Danny drives 8 miles to the first friend's house. Then, he drives half that distance, which is 4 miles, to the second friend's house. So far, he has driven 8 + 4 = 12 miles. Next, he drives 3 times the total distance driven so far to get to work. The total distance driven so far is 12 miles, so he drives 3 x 12 = 36 miles to get to work. To find out how many miles Danny drives between the second friend's house and work, we need to subtract the distance he has already driven (8 miles to the first friend's house and 4 miles to the second friend's house) from the total distance he drives to get to work. So, Danny drives 36 - 8 - 4 = 24 miles between the second friend's house and work. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Jessica just got her driving permit. She must complete 50 hours of driving with a parent to get her driver\u2019s license. It takes 20 minutes to drive to school. If she drives to and from school every day, how many school days will it take Jessica to meet the 50-hour driving requirement?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much time Jessica spends driving to and from school each day. She drives to school and back, so that's a total of 2 trips. Each trip takes 20 minutes, so she spends 40 minutes driving to and from school each day. Next, we need to figure out how many minutes of driving Jessica needs to complete in order to reach the 50-hour requirement. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 50 hours is equal to 50 x 60 = 3000 minutes. Now we can divide the total minutes of driving required by the number of minutes Jessica spends driving each day: 3000 / 40 = 75. So Jessica needs to drive for 75 school days in order to complete the 50-hour driving requirement. The answer is 50.\n\n\n"
