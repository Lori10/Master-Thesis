  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Betty and Dora started making some cupcakes at the same time. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour and Dora makes 8 every hour. If Betty took a two-hour break, what is the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Betty made in the first 3 hours before taking a break. Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour, so in 3 hours, she would make: 10 cupcakes/hour x 3 hours = 30 cupcakes Next, we need to find out how many cupcakes Dora made in the same 5 hours. Dora makes 8 cupcakes every hour, so in 5 hours, she would make: 8 cupcakes/hour x 5 hours = 40 cupcakes Now we need to find the difference between the number of cupcakes they made. Betty made 30 cupcakes before taking a break, and Dora made 40 cupcakes in the same 5 hours. So the difference between the number of cupcakes they made is: 40 cupcakes - 30 cupcakes = 10 cupcakes Therefore, the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours is 10 cupcakes. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Harry uses a whole bag of chocolate chips when he makes dough for chocolate chip cookies. The dough makes three batches of cookies, and each cookie has nine chocolate chips in it. A bag of chocolate chips has 81 chips in it. How many cookies are in a batch?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Harry uses a whole bag of chocolate chips for three batches of cookies. So, we can divide the number of chips in a bag by 3 to find out how many chips are in each batch: 81 chips / 3 batches = 27 chips per batch Next, we know that each cookie has 9 chocolate chips in it. So, we can divide the number of chips per batch by 9 to find out how many cookies are in each batch: 27 chips per batch / 9 chips per cookie = 3 cookies per batch Therefore, there are 3 cookies in each batch. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: A bakery sells boxes of doughnuts and if there are any doughnuts left at the end of the day, the bakery gives them away. Each box of doughnuts holds 10 doughnuts and all of the doughnuts that the bakery makes are put into these boxes. The bakery makes 300 doughnuts for the day and sells 27 boxes of doughnuts throughout the day. How many doughnuts are given away at the end of the day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many doughnuts were sold during the day. We know that each box contains 10 doughnuts, so 27 boxes would contain 27 x 10 = 270 doughnuts. Next, we can subtract the number of doughnuts sold from the total number of doughnuts made to find out how many were left over. 300 - 270 = 30 Therefore, there are 30 doughnuts left at the end of the day that will be given away. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: Valerie\u2019s cookie recipe makes 16 dozen cookies and calls for 4 pounds of butter.  She only wants to make 4 dozen cookies for the weekend.  How many pounds of butter will she need?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cookies Valerie needs to make for the weekend. Since she only wants to make 4 dozen cookies, we can calculate that as: 4 dozen cookies = 4 x 12 = 48 cookies Next, we need to figure out how much butter is needed for 16 dozen cookies. If 16 dozen cookies require 4 pounds of butter, we can set up a proportion: 16 dozen cookies / 4 pounds of butter = 1 dozen cookies / x pounds of butter To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 16 dozen cookies * x pounds of butter = 4 pounds of butter * 1 dozen cookies 16x = 48 x = 3 Therefore, Valerie will need 3 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen cookies for the weekend. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Mary wants 144 cupcakes for her party. Mary has already made 36 cherry cupcakes, and 48 berry cupcakes. Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes for the rest. How much of each should she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Mary has already made: 36 cherry + 48 berry = 84 cupcakes Next, we need to figure out how many more cupcakes Mary needs to make: 144 total cupcakes - 84 cupcakes already made = 60 cupcakes Since Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, we can divide the remaining 60 cupcakes by 2: 60 cupcakes \u00f7 2 = 30 cupcakes of each flavor Therefore, Mary should make 30 chocolate cupcakes and 30 vanilla cupcakes to have a total of 144 cupcakes for her party. The answer is 144.\n\n\nQ: Brenda bakes 20 cakes a day. She does this for 9 days and then sells half of the cakes. How many cakes are left with Brenda?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cakes Brenda bakes in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of cakes she bakes per day (20) by the number of days she bakes (9): 20 cakes/day x 9 days = 180 cakes So Brenda bakes 180 cakes in total. Next, we need to find out how many cakes Brenda sells. We know she sells half of the cakes, which is the same as dividing the total number of cakes by 2: 180 cakes / 2 = 90 cakes So Brenda sells 90 cakes. Finally, we need to find out how many cakes Brenda has left. To do this, we can subtract the number of cakes she sold from the total number of cakes she baked: 180 cakes - 90 cakes = 90 cakes So Brenda has 90 cakes left. The answer is 90.\n\n\nQ: In preparation for the church fundraiser, Julia bakes one less than 5 cakes per day for 6 days.  Unfortunately, every other day, Julia's brother, Clifford, sneaks into Julia's house and eats one of Julia's cakes.  At the end of 6 days, how many cakes does Julia have remaining?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cakes Julia bakes per day. We know that she bakes one less than 5 cakes per day, so that means she bakes 4 cakes per day. Next, we need to figure out how many cakes Julia bakes in total over the 6 days. To do this, we can multiply the number of cakes she bakes per day (4) by the number of days she bakes (6): 4 cakes/day x 6 days = 24 cakes So Julia bakes a total of 24 cakes over the 6 days. Now we need to figure out how many cakes Clifford eats. We know that he eats one of Julia's cakes every other day, so that means he eats 3 cakes over the 6 days (since there are 3 pairs of days where he eats a cake). Finally, we can subtract the number of cakes Clifford eats from the total number of cakes Julia bakes to find out how many cakes she has remaining: 24 cakes - 3 cakes = 21 cakes So Julia has 21 cakes remaining at the end of the 6 days. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Brenda volunteered to make 3 trays of banana pudding for the family reunion.  Each tray of banana pudding would need 80 wafer cookies.  A box of wafer cookies only had 60 cookies per box.  Each box costs $3.50.  How much will it cost her to buy just enough boxes for 3 trays of banana pudding?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many wafer cookies Brenda needs in total. She needs 80 cookies per tray and she's making 3 trays, so she needs: 80 x 3 = 240 wafer cookies Next, we need to figure out how many boxes of cookies she needs to buy. Each box has 60 cookies, so we can divide the total number of cookies needed by the number of cookies per box: 240 \u00f7 60 = 4 boxes So Brenda needs to buy 4 boxes of cookies. Each box costs $3.50, so we can multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box: 4 x $3.50 = $14 Therefore, it will cost Brenda $14 to buy just enough boxes for 3 trays of banana pudding. The answer is 3.\n\n\n"
