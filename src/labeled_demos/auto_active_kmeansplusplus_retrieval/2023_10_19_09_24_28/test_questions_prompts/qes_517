  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Tom turned 32 years old 5 years ago.  7 years ago Jim was 5 years older than half Tom's age.  How old is Jim in 2 years?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find Tom's current age. We know that he turned 32 years old 5 years ago, so we can add 32 and 5 to get his current age: Tom's current age = 32 + 5 = 37 Next, we need to figure out how old Jim was 7 years ago. We know that 7 years ago, Jim was 5 years older than half of Tom's age. Half of Tom's age is: 37 / 2 = 18.5 So 7 years ago, Jim was: 18.5 + 5 = 23.5 Now we need to find Jim's current age. We know that 7 years have passed since we calculated Jim's age, so we need to add 7 to his age: Jim's current age = 23.5 + 7 = 30.5 Finally, we need to find Jim's age in 2 years. We can simply add 2 to his current age: Jim's age in 2 years = 30.5 + 2 = 32.5 Therefore, Jim will be 32.5 years old in 2 years. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Marco has $24. Mary has $15. If Marco gives Mary half of what he has, Mary will have more than Marco. But Mary spends $5. How much more money does Mary have than Marco?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much money Marco gives to Mary. Since Marco has $24, half of that would be $12. So, Marco gives $12 to Mary. After receiving $12 from Marco, Mary will have $15 + $12 = $27. However, Mary spends $5, so we need to subtract that from her total. $27 - $5 = $22. Therefore, Mary has $22 more than Marco. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Darcie is 4 years old. She is 1/6 as old as her mother and her mother is 4/5 as old as her father. How old is her father?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can use algebra to represent Darcie's mother's age in terms of Darcie's age. Let's call Darcie's mother's age \"M\". We know that Darcie is 1/6 as old as her mother, so we can write: Darcie's age = 1/6 x Darcie's mother's age 4 = 1/6M Next, we can use algebra to represent Darcie's father's age in terms of Darcie's mother's age. Let's call Darcie's father's age \"F\". We know that Darcie's mother is 4/5 as old as her father, so we can write: Darcie's mother's age = 4/5 x Darcie's father's age M = 4/5F Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for F: 4 = 1/6M 4 = 1/6(4/5F) 4 = 2/15F F = 30 Therefore, Darcie's father is 30 years old. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: Karina was born in 1970 and she is currently twice as old as her brother. If her current age is 40, in what year was her brother born?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Karina's current age is 40. We also know that she is currently twice as old as her brother. Therefore, we can set up an equation: 40 = 2x where x is her brother's current age. Solving for x, we get: x = 20 So Karina's brother is currently 20 years old. Next, we need to figure out in what year he was born. We know that Karina was born in 1970, so we can subtract her brother's age from that year: 1970 - 20 = 1950 Therefore, Karina's brother was born in 1950. The answer is 1950.\n\n\nQ: Four classmates were comparing their ages based on their birth month. They found out that Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese while Therese is 5 months older than Aivo. Then, Leon is 2 months older than Aivo. How much older in months is Jolyn than Leon?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine the age difference between Aivo and Therese. We know that Therese is 5 months older than Aivo. Next, we need to determine the age difference between Jolyn and Therese. We know that Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese. Then, we need to determine the age difference between Leon and Aivo. We know that Leon is 2 months older than Aivo. To find the age difference between Jolyn and Leon, we need to add up the age differences between Jolyn and Therese, Therese and Aivo, and Aivo and Leon. (2 months + 5 months + 2 months) = 9 months Therefore, Jolyn is 9 months older than Leon. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: 9 years from now, John will be 3 times as old as he was 11 years ago. How old is he now?\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume John's current age is x. 11 years ago, John's age was x - 11. 9 years from now, John's age will be x + 9. According to the problem, 9 years from now, John will be 3 times as old as he was 11 years ago. So, we can write the equation: x + 9 = 3(x - 11) Now, we can solve for x: x + 9 = 3x - 33 42 = 2x x = 21 Therefore, John is currently 21 years old. The answer is 21.\n\n\nQ: John has 10 members of his family on his father's side.  His mother's side is 30% larger.  How many people are there in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to find out how many people are on John's mother's side. We know that it is 30% larger than his father's side, so we can calculate: 30% of 10 = 0.3 x 10 = 3 This means that John has 3 more family members on his mother's side than on his father's side. So, the total number of family members on his mother's side is: 10 + 3 = 13 Now, we can add up the number of family members on both sides to find the total: 10 + 13 = 23 Therefore, there are 23 people in John's family in total. The answer is 23.\n\n\nQ: Seth lost 17.5 pounds. Jerome lost three times that many pounds and Veronica lost 1.5 pounds more than Seth. How many pounds did the 3 people lose in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Seth lost 17.5 pounds. Next, we need to find out how much weight Jerome lost. We are told that Jerome lost three times as much weight as Seth, so we can multiply Seth's weight loss by 3: 17.5 x 3 = 52.5 So Jerome lost 52.5 pounds. Finally, we need to find out how much weight Veronica lost. We are told that she lost 1.5 pounds more than Seth, so we can add 1.5 to Seth's weight loss: 17.5 + 1.5 = 19 So Veronica lost 19 pounds. To find the total weight loss for all three people, we can add up their individual weight losses: 17.5 + 52.5 + 19 = 89 Therefore, the three people lost a total of 89 pounds. The answer is 89.\n\n\n"
