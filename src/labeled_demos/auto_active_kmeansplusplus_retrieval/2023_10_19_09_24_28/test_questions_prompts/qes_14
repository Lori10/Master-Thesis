  "formatted_prompt": "Q: James and 4 of his friends volunteered to plant flowers. In 2 days, they were able to plant a total of 200 flowers. If each of them planted the same number of flowers, how many flowers did James plant in a day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people were planting flowers. We know that James and 4 of his friends volunteered, so there were 5 people in total. Next, we need to find out how many flowers each person planted in 2 days. To do this, we can divide the total number of flowers planted (200) by the number of people (5) and the number of days (2): 200 \u00f7 5 \u00f7 2 = 20 So each person planted 20 flowers in 2 days. Finally, we need to find out how many flowers James planted in 1 day. Since each person planted 20 flowers in 2 days, we can divide that by 2 to find out how many flowers each person planted in 1 day: 20 \u00f7 2 = 10 Therefore, James planted 10 flowers in 1 day. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Dane\u2019s two daughters need to plant 5 flowers each to grow a garden. As the days passed, the flowers grew into 20 more but 10 of them died. Dane\u2019s daughters harvested the flowers and split them between 5 different baskets. How many flowers ended up in each basket?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many flowers were in the garden before the 20 grew and 10 died. Dane's two daughters planted 5 flowers each, so they planted a total of 2 x 5 = 10 flowers. After the flowers grew, there were 10 + 20 = 30 flowers in the garden. But then 10 of them died, so there were 30 - 10 = 20 flowers left. Finally, the 20 flowers were split between 5 baskets, so each basket had 20 / 5 = 4 flowers. Therefore, each basket ended up with 4 flowers. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: A tomato plant has 100 tomatoes. Jane picks 1/4 of that number for use in their house. After a week, she goes back and picks 20 more tomatoes, and the following week picks twice that number. What's the total number of fruits remaining on the tomato plant?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Jane picks 1/4 of 100 tomatoes, which is 25 tomatoes. So, there are 100 - 25 = 75 tomatoes left on the plant. After a week, Jane picks 20 more tomatoes, so there are 75 - 20 = 55 tomatoes left on the plant. The following week, Jane picks twice the number of tomatoes she picked the previous week, which is 2 * 20 = 40 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes Jane picked is 25 + 20 + 40 = 85 tomatoes. The total number of tomatoes remaining on the plant is 100 - 85 = 15 tomatoes. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Madeline wants to plant 20 flowers in her garden. She assumes that about half of the seeds she plants will die before they bloom. However, the flower shop only sells packs of seeds with 25 seeds per pack. Each pack is $5. How much will Madeline spend on seeds to plant 20 flowers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many seeds Madeline needs to plant 20 flowers. Since she assumes that about half of the seeds will die, she needs to plant twice as many seeds as the number of flowers she wants. Therefore, she needs to plant 20 x 2 = 40 seeds. Next, we need to figure out how many packs of seeds Madeline needs to buy. Since each pack contains 25 seeds, she needs to buy 40 / 25 = 1.6 packs of seeds. Since she can't buy a fraction of a pack, she needs to round up to the nearest whole pack. Therefore, she needs to buy 2 packs of seeds. Finally, we need to figure out how much Madeline will spend on seeds. Since each pack costs $5 and she needs to buy 2 packs, she will spend 5 x 2 = $10 on seeds. Therefore, Madeline will spend $10 on seeds to plant 20 flowers. The answer is 20.\n\n\nQ: Jim has 2 rows of 4 trees to start.  When he turns 10 he decides to plant a new row of trees every year on his birthday.  On his 15th birthday after he doubles the number of trees he has.  How many trees does he have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller steps. Step 1: Jim starts with 2 rows of 4 trees each, so he has a total of 2 x 4 = 8 trees. Step 2: Jim plants a new row of trees every year on his birthday, starting from his 10th birthday. So, he plants trees for 15 - 10 = 5 years. Step 3: In these 5 years, Jim plants 5 new rows of trees, one row each year. Step 4: Therefore, Jim now has a total of 2 + 5 = 7 rows of trees. Step 5: Each row has 4 trees, so Jim has a total of 7 x 4 = 28 trees. Step 6: On his 15th birthday, Jim doubles the number of trees he has. So, he now has 28 x 2 = 56 trees. Therefore, Jim has 56 trees after he doubles the number of trees he has on his 15th birthday. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Mary has 26 blue shirts and 36 brown shirts. If she gives away half of her blue shirts and a third of her brown shirts, how many shirts does she have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many blue shirts Mary gives away. Half of her blue shirts would be: 26 / 2 = 13 So Mary gives away 13 blue shirts. Next, we need to find out how many brown shirts Mary gives away. A third of her brown shirts would be: 36 / 3 = 12 So Mary gives away 12 brown shirts. Now we can find out how many shirts Mary has left. She started with 26 blue shirts and gave away 13, so she has: 26 - 13 = 13 blue shirts left She started with 36 brown shirts and gave away 12, so she has: 36 - 12 = 24 brown shirts left Therefore, Mary has 13 + 24 = 37 shirts left. The answer is 37.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Maria's birthday is in 22 days. Her friend Lilly wants to buy her flowers so she saves $2 each day until Maria's birthday. If a flower costs $4, how many flowers can she buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Lilly will have saved up by Maria's birthday. Lilly saves $2 each day for 22 days, so she will have saved: $2/day x 22 days = $44 Now we need to figure out how many flowers Lilly can buy with $44. Each flower costs $4, so we can divide the total amount of money Lilly has saved by the cost of each flower: $44 \u00f7 $4/flower = 11 flowers Therefore, Lilly can buy 11 flowers for Maria's birthday. The answer is 11.\n\n\n"
