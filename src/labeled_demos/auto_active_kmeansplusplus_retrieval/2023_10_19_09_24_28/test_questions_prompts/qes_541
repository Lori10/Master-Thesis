  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Cristine bought a dozen lemons and gave 1/4 of them to her neighbor. How many lemons does Cristine have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine how many lemons are in a dozen. A dozen is equal to 12, so Cristine bought 12 lemons. Next, we need to figure out how many lemons Cristine gave to her neighbor. She gave away 1/4 of the lemons, which means she gave away 1/4 x 12 = 3 lemons. To find out how many lemons Cristine has left, we need to subtract the number of lemons she gave away from the total number of lemons she bought. 12 - 3 = 9 Therefore, Cristine has 9 lemons left. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Vicente saw Sophie's mom giving Sophie 20 oranges every day to carry to school to eat. He also saw Hannah's dad giving Hannah 40 grapes every day to eat at the school. If he counted the number of fruits that the girls were given for 30 days, calculate the total number of fruits that Sophie and Hannah had eaten in the 30 days.\nA: Let's think step by step. Sophie was given 20 oranges every day for 30 days, so the total number of oranges she received is: 20 oranges/day x 30 days = 600 oranges Similarly, Hannah was given 40 grapes every day for 30 days, so the total number of grapes she received is: 40 grapes/day x 30 days = 1200 grapes Therefore, the total number of fruits that Sophie and Hannah had eaten in the 30 days is: 600 oranges + 1200 grapes = 1800 fruits The answer is 1800.\n\n\nQ: Harold had 100 marbles. He kept 20 marbles and shared the rest evenly among his 5 friends. How many marbles did each friend get?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many marbles Harold gave away. To do this, we need to subtract the number of marbles he kept from the total number of marbles he had: 100 - 20 = 80 So Harold gave away 80 marbles. Step 2: Divide the number of marbles Harold gave away by the number of friends he shared them with. To do this, we need to divide 80 by 5: 80 \u00f7 5 = 16 So each friend got 16 marbles. Therefore, each friend got 16 marbles. The answer is 16.\n\n\nQ: Ella has 4 bags with 20 apples in each bag and six bags with 25 apples in each bag. If Ella sells 200 apples, how many apples does Ella has left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many apples Ella has in total. She has 4 bags with 20 apples in each bag, so that's 4 x 20 = 80 apples. She also has 6 bags with 25 apples in each bag, so that's 6 x 25 = 150 apples. In total, Ella has 80 + 150 = 230 apples. If she sells 200 apples, we can subtract that from the total: 230 - 200 = 30 Therefore, Ella has 30 apples left. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: James takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces.  He splits the pieces between 4 people.  If an orange has 80 calories how many calories does each person get?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pieces James has in total. He takes 5 oranges and breaks each orange into 8 pieces, so he has 5 x 8 = 40 pieces in total. Next, we need to divide the pieces between 4 people. To do this, we can divide the total number of pieces by 4: 40 \u00f7 4 = 10 pieces per person. Finally, we need to find out how many calories each person gets. We know that one orange has 80 calories, so each piece has 80 \u00f7 8 = 10 calories. Therefore, each person gets 10 x 10 = 100 calories. So each person gets 100 calories. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Phill cuts the pizza in half, which gives him 2 slices. Then he cuts both halves in half, which gives him 4 slices. And then he cuts each slice in half again, which gives him 8 slices in total. Next, Phill passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends, which means he gives away 3 slices in total. He also passes out 2 slices to 2 of his friends, which means he gives away 4 slices in total. Therefore, Phill has given away a total of 7 slices of pizza. If he started with 8 slices, then he has 1 slice left for himself. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Colby harvested his mango trees, the total mangoes he harvested is 60 kilograms. He sold 20 kilograms to the market and sold the remaining half to his community. If each kilogram contains 8 mangoes, how many mangoes does he still have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many kilograms of mangoes Colby sold to his community. We know that he sold 20 kilograms to the market, so he had 60 - 20 = 40 kilograms left. Next, we need to find out how many kilograms of mangoes he sold to his community. We know that he sold half of the remaining 40 kilograms, which is 40/2 = 20 kilograms. Finally, we need to find out how many mangoes he still has. We know that each kilogram contains 8 mangoes, so he sold a total of 20 + 20 = 40 kilograms, which is equivalent to 40 x 8 = 320 mangoes. Therefore, Colby still has 60 - 40 = 20 kilograms of mangoes, which is equivalent to 20 x 8 = 160 mangoes. The answer is 160.\n\n\nQ: Phoebe has two pizzas to share with her and three friends. One has pepperoni and the other has cheese. They both have 16 slices. They all eat the same amount. One friend eats only pepperoni, while the rest have an equal number of slices of each. At the end, there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese, how many slices does each person eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 2 pizzas with 16 slices each, so there are a total of 32 slices. Next, we know that one friend only eats pepperoni, so they eat one slice from the pepperoni pizza. That leaves 31 slices, with 15 slices from each pizza. We also know that there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese left. So, the remaining 15 slices are divided equally among the remaining 3 friends, which means each of them eats 5 slices. Therefore, each person eats 1 slice of pepperoni and 5 slices of cheese. The answer is 5.\n\n\n"
