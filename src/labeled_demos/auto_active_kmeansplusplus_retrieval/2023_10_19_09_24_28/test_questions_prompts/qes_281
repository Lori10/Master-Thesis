  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A pie shop charges $5 for a slice of pie. They cut each whole pie into 4 slices. How much money will the pie shop make if they sell 9 pies?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of pie are in 9 whole pies. Since each pie is cut into 4 slices, we can multiply 9 by 4 to get the total number of slices: 9 x 4 = 36 So there are 36 slices of pie in 9 whole pies. Next, we need to find out how much money the pie shop will make if they sell all 36 slices. Each slice costs $5, so we can multiply 36 by 5 to get the total amount of money: 36 x 5 = 180 Therefore, the pie shop will make $180 if they sell 9 whole pies, each cut into 4 slices, at $5 per slice. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Five people are planning a party. Sonja will buy a loaf of French bread ($3 a loaf) and a platter of cold cuts ($23). Barbara will buy the soda ($1 per person) and two boxes of crackers ($2 per box). Mario and Rick will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles ($3 per package). Danica will supply a package of paper plates for $4. How much more will Sonja spend than the rest of the office put together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of Barbara's contribution. She will buy soda for 5 people, which will cost $5 (1 dollar per person). She will also buy two boxes of crackers, which will cost $4 (2 dollars per box). Therefore, Barbara's total contribution will be $9. Next, let's calculate the total cost of Mario and Rick's contribution. They will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles, which will cost $6 in total (3 dollars per package). Now, let's add up the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's. Barbara's contribution is $9, Mario and Rick's contribution is $6, and Danica's contribution is $4. Therefore, the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's is $19. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of Sonja's contribution. She will buy a loaf of French bread for $3 and a platter of cold cuts for $23. Therefore, Sonja's total contribution will be $26. To find out how much more Sonja will spend than the rest of the office put together, we need to subtract the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's from Sonja's total contribution. $26 (Sonja's contribution) - $19 (total cost of everyone else's contribution) = $7 Therefore, Sonja will spend $7 more than the rest of the office put together. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: There are four lamps in Valerie's room. All of them are burnt out, so she needs to buy new light bulbs. She needs 3 small light bulbs and 1 large light bulb. She has $60 to spend. If small light bulbs cost $8 and large light bulbs cost $12, how much money will Valerie have left over?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total cost of the light bulbs Valerie needs to buy. The cost of 3 small light bulbs is: 3 x $8 = $24 The cost of 1 large light bulb is: 1 x $12 = $12 So the total cost is: $24 + $12 = $36 Next, we need to subtract the total cost from the amount of money Valerie has: $60 - $36 = $24 Therefore, Valerie will have $24 left over after buying the light bulbs. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Samuel is going to the cinema with his brother, Kevin. They both have a total budget of $20 for their outing. Samuel buys his $14 ticket, then spends $6 on drinks and food. Kevin buys his ticket, then spends $2 on drinks. They have both used their entire budget. How much did Kevin spend on food?\nA: Let's think step by step. Samuel spent $14 on his ticket and $6 on food and drinks, which means he spent a total of $20. This means that Kevin must have spent $0 on food and drinks, since they both used their entire budget of $20. Therefore, Kevin spent $6 on his ticket and $2 on drinks, which means he spent a total of $8. Since he didn't spend any money on food, the answer is $0. The answer is 0.\n\n\nQ: At Penny\u2019s bakery, her famous blueberry cheesecakes are $7 a slice.  Each cheesecake pie is cut into 6 thick slices.  If she sells 7 cheesecake pies, how much money does she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of cheesecake Penny has in total. Since each cheesecake pie is cut into 6 slices, we can multiply 6 by the number of cheesecake pies she sold: 6 slices/pie x 7 pies = 42 slices So Penny sold 42 slices of blueberry cheesecake. Next, we need to find out how much money she made from selling those 42 slices. Each slice costs $7, so we can multiply 7 by the number of slices: $7/slice x 42 slices = $294 Therefore, Penny made $294 from selling 7 cheesecake pies. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Whitney\u2019s mom gave her two $20 bills to spend at the school book fair. Whitney has decided to buy 2 posters, 3 notebooks, and 2 bookmarks. Each poster costs $5, each notebook costs $4, and each bookmark costs $2. How much money, in dollars, will Whitney have left over after the purchase?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of the posters. Whitney is buying 2 posters, and each poster costs $5, so the total cost of the posters is 2 x $5 = $10. Next, let's calculate the total cost of the notebooks. Whitney is buying 3 notebooks, and each notebook costs $4, so the total cost of the notebooks is 3 x $4 = $12. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the bookmarks. Whitney is buying 2 bookmarks, and each bookmark costs $2, so the total cost of the bookmarks is 2 x $2 = $4. Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Whitney is buying: $10 + $12 + $4 = $26. Whitney started with two $20 bills, which is a total of $40. After spending $26 on the posters, notebooks, and bookmarks, she will have $40 - $26 = $14 left over. Therefore, Whitney will have $14 left over after the purchase. The answer is 14.\n\n\nQ: Phoebe has two pizzas to share with her and three friends. One has pepperoni and the other has cheese. They both have 16 slices. They all eat the same amount. One friend eats only pepperoni, while the rest have an equal number of slices of each. At the end, there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese, how many slices does each person eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 2 pizzas with 16 slices each, so there are a total of 32 slices. Next, we know that one friend only eats pepperoni, so they eat one slice from the pepperoni pizza. That leaves 31 slices, with 15 slices from each pizza. We also know that there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese left. So, the remaining 15 slices are divided equally among the remaining 3 friends, which means each of them eats 5 slices. Therefore, each person eats 1 slice of pepperoni and 5 slices of cheese. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Francis and Kiera had breakfast at a cafe. Muffins cost $2 each, and fruit cups cost $3 each. Francis had 2 muffins and 2 fruit cups. Kiera had 2 muffins and 1 fruit cup. How much did their breakfast cost?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the cost of Francis's breakfast. 2 muffins cost 2 x $2 = $4 2 fruit cups cost 2 x $3 = $6 So Francis's breakfast cost $4 + $6 = $10 Now let's calculate the cost of Kiera's breakfast. 2 muffins cost 2 x $2 = $4 1 fruit cup costs $3 So Kiera's breakfast cost $4 + $3 = $7 Finally, let's add the cost of Francis's and Kiera's breakfast to find the total cost. $10 + $7 = $17 Therefore, their breakfast cost $17 in total. The answer is 17.\n\n\n"
