  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Billy has 8 hours of free time on each day of the weekend. He wants to spend 75% of his time playing video games and the rest of his time reading. He can read 60 pages an hour and his books all contain 80 pages. How many books does he read?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts. First, we need to find out how much time Billy spends playing video games and how much time he spends reading. He has 8 hours of free time on each day of the weekend, so that's a total of 16 hours for the entire weekend. If he wants to spend 75% of his time playing video games, that means he will spend 0.75 x 16 = 12 hours playing video games. The rest of his time will be spent reading, which is 16 - 12 = 4 hours. Next, we need to find out how many pages he can read in 1 hour. We know that he can read 60 pages an hour, so that's 60 pages/hour. Finally, we need to find out how many books he can read in 4 hours. Each book contains 80 pages, so he can read 60/80 = 0.75 of a book in 1 hour. In 4 hours, he can read 4 x 0.75 = 3 books. Therefore, Billy can read 3 books during his free time on the weekend. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: During her first year playing soccer, Tara's dad attended 90% of the games she played.  In her second year playing soccer, Tara's dad attended 4 fewer games than he did in the previous year.  If Tara played 20 games each year, how many games did Tara's dad attend in her second year playing soccer?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many games Tara's dad attended in her first year playing soccer. We know that he attended 90% of the games, which means he attended: 90% of 20 games = 0.9 x 20 = 18 games So Tara's dad attended 18 games in her first year playing soccer. Next, we need to find out how many games Tara's dad attended in her second year playing soccer. We know that he attended 4 fewer games than he did in the previous year, which means he attended: 18 games - 4 games = 14 games So Tara's dad attended 14 games in her second year playing soccer. The answer is 14.\n\n\nQ: Monica way studying for an exam. She studied for 2 hours on Wednesday and three times as long on Thursday. On Friday Monica studied half of the time she studied on Thursday. During the weekend (two days) Monica studied as much again as Wednesday, Thursday and Friday combined. How much time did she spend studying in total during the five days?\nA: Let's think step by step. On Wednesday, Monica studied for 2 hours. On Thursday, she studied three times as long as Wednesday, which means she studied for 2 x 3 = 6 hours. On Friday, she studied half of the time she studied on Thursday, which means she studied for 6 / 2 = 3 hours. The total time Monica studied from Wednesday to Friday is 2 + 6 + 3 = 11 hours. During the weekend, Monica studied as much again as Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday combined, which means she studied for 11 x 2 = 22 hours. Therefore, Monica spent a total of 11 + 22 = 33 hours studying during the five days. The answer is 33.\n\n\nQ: Peter and Kristin are to read 20 fantasy novels each in a week. Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin. If Peter reads one book in 18 hours, how long will Kristin read half of her books?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Peter to read one book. We know that he can read one book in 18 hours, so we can write: Peter's reading speed = 1 book / 18 hours Next, we need to find out how long it takes Kristin to read one book. We know that Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin, so we can write: Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * Peter's reading speed Kristin's reading speed = 1/3 * (1 book / 18 hours) Kristin's reading speed = 1 book / 54 hours Now we can use Kristin's reading speed to find out how long it takes her to read half of her books. We know that she needs to read 20 books in a week, so she needs to read 10 books in half a week (3.5 days). We can write: Time to read 10 books = 10 books * (1 book / 54 hours) * (24 hours / 1 day) * (3.5 days) Time to read 10 books = 14 hours and 27 minutes Therefore, it will take Kristin 14 hours and 27 minutes to read half of her books. The answer is 27.\n\n\nQ: Theresa has 5 more than thrice as many video games as Julia. Julia has a third as many video games as Tory. If Tory has 6 video games, how many video games does Theresa have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many video games Julia has. We know that Julia has a third as many video games as Tory, who has 6 video games. So, Julia has 6/3 = 2 video games. Next, we need to find out how many video games Theresa has. We know that Theresa has 5 more than thrice as many video games as Julia. So, we can write an equation: Theresa's video games = 5 + 3 * Julia's video games Substituting Julia's video games with 2, we get: Theresa's video games = 5 + 3 * 2 Theresa's video games = 11 Therefore, Theresa has 11 video games. The answer is 11.\n\n\nQ: A book has 8 chapters. Beth has read 2 chapters in 3 hours. If she continues reading at that rate, in how many hours will she be able to finish reading the remaining chapters?\nA: Let's think step by step. Beth has already read 2 chapters, so she needs to read the remaining 8 - 2 = 6 chapters. She can read 2 chapters in 3 hours, so she can read 1 chapter in 3/2 = 1.5 hours. Therefore, she will be able to finish reading the remaining 6 chapters in 6 x 1.5 = 9 hours. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Jenny wants to read 3 books in the next 10 days. She can read 100 words per hour. If the first book has 200 words, the second book has 400 words, and the third book has 300 words, how many minutes per day, on average, should she spend reading?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find the total number of words in all three books: 200 + 400 + 300 = 900 words Next, let's find the total number of hours it will take Jenny to read all three books: 900 words \u00f7 100 words per hour = 9 hours Now, let's find the average number of minutes per day that Jenny should spend reading: 9 hours \u00f7 10 days = 0.9 hours per day 0.9 hours per day x 60 minutes per hour = 54 minutes per day Therefore, Jenny should spend an average of 54 minutes per day reading to finish all three books in 10 days. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Gina chooses what she and her sister will watch on Netflix three times as often as her sister does. If her sister watches a total of 24 shows on Netflix per week, and each show is 50 minutes long, how many minutes of Netflix does Gina get to choose?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how often Gina chooses what they watch compared to her sister. We know that Gina chooses three times as often as her sister, so if her sister watches 24 shows per week, Gina chooses what they watch 3 times that amount, or 3 x 24 = 72 times per week. Next, we need to figure out how many minutes of Netflix each person gets to choose. We know that each show is 50 minutes long, so if Gina chooses 72 shows per week, she gets to choose 72 x 50 = 3600 minutes of Netflix per week. Therefore, Gina gets to choose 3600 minutes of Netflix per week. The answer is 3600.\n\n\n"
