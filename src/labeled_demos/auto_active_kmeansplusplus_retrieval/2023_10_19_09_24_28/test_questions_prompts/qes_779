  "formatted_prompt": "Q: John buys game loot boxes for $5 each.  The average value of items inside is $3.5.   He spends $40 on loot boxes.  What is the average amount he lost?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many loot boxes John bought. We can do this by dividing the total amount he spent by the cost of each loot box: 40 / 5 = 8 So John bought 8 loot boxes. Next, we need to find out the total value of the items inside all the loot boxes. We can do this by multiplying the average value of each box by the number of boxes: 3.5 x 8 = 28 So the total value of the items inside all the loot boxes is $28. Finally, we can find out the average amount John lost by subtracting the total value of the items from the total amount he spent: 40 - 28 = 12 So John lost an average of $12 on each loot box. The answer is 12.\n\n\nQ: John buys 500 newspapers.  Each newspaper sells for $2.  He sells 80% of them.  He buys them all for 75% less than the price at which he sells them.  How much profit does he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate how much John buys the newspapers for. He buys them for 75% less than the price at which he sells them, which means he buys them for 25% of the selling price. 25% of the selling price = 0.25 x 2 = $0.50 So, John buys each newspaper for $0.50. Next, let's calculate how much John earns from selling the newspapers. He sells 80% of the 500 newspapers, which is: 0.8 x 500 = 400 newspapers He sells each newspaper for $2, so his total earnings are: 400 x 2 = $800 Now, let's calculate how much John spent on buying the newspapers: 500 x 0.50 = $250 Therefore, John's profit is: $800 - $250 = $550 So, John makes a profit of $550. The answer is 550.\n\n\nQ: James buys $3000 worth of stuff from Amazon.  He has to return a TV that cost $700 and a bike that cost $500.  He also sells another bike that cost 20% more than the bike he returned for 80% of what he bought it for.  He then buys a toaster for $100.  How much is he out of pocket for everything?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, James spent $3000 on Amazon. Then he returned a TV that cost $700 and a bike that cost $500. So, he spent $3000 - $700 - $500 = $1800. Next, he sold a bike that cost 20% more than the bike he returned. If the returned bike cost $500, then the bike he sold cost 1.2 * $500 = $600. He sold it for 80% of what he bought it for, which is 0.8 * $600 = $480. Now, let's add up all the transactions. James spent $1800 on Amazon, sold a bike for $480, and bought a toaster for $100. So, he is out of pocket for $1800 - $480 + $100 = $1420. Therefore, James is out of pocket for $1420. The answer is 1420.\n\n\nQ: A beadshop earns a third of its profit on Monday, a quarter of its profit on Tuesday and the rest of its profit on Wednesday. The shop makes a total profit of $1,200. How much profit, in dollars, was made on Wednesday?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much profit the shop makes on Monday and Tuesday combined. Profit on Monday = 1/3 x $1,200 = $400 Profit on Tuesday = 1/4 x $1,200 = $300 Total profit on Monday and Tuesday = $400 + $300 = $700 Now, we can find out how much profit was made on Wednesday by subtracting the total profit on Monday and Tuesday from the total profit: Profit on Wednesday = $1,200 - $700 = $500 Therefore, the profit made on Wednesday was $500. The answer is 500.\n\n\nQ: Sean designs and sells patches.  He orders his patches in a unit of 100 and is charged $1.25 per patch.  If he turns around and sells all 100 patches for $12.00 each, what is his net profit?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of 100 patches for Sean. Cost of 100 patches = 100 x $1.25 = $125 Next, we need to calculate the revenue generated by selling 100 patches at $12.00 each. Revenue from 100 patches = 100 x $12.00 = $1200 Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the cost from the revenue. Net profit = Revenue - Cost = $1200 - $125 = $1075 Therefore, Sean's net profit is $1075. The answer is 1075.\n\n\nQ: John chops down 30 trees.  From each tree, he can make 25 planks.  A table takes 15 planks to make and sells for $300.  He paid $3000 for all the labor.  How much profit did he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many planks John can make in total. 30 trees x 25 planks per tree = 750 planks Next, we need to figure out how many tables John can make with those planks. 750 planks / 15 planks per table = 50 tables Now we can calculate John's revenue from selling those tables. 50 tables x $300 per table = $15,000 Finally, we need to subtract the cost of labor to find John's profit. $15,000 - $3,000 = $12,000 Therefore, John made a profit of $12,000. The answer is 12000.\n\n\nQ: Bart buys $10 of notepads for $1.25 each.  They have 60 pages each.  How many pages did he buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many notepads Bart bought. We can do this by dividing the total amount he spent by the cost of each notepad: $10 \u00f7 $1.25 = 8 notepads Next, we need to find out how many pages are in each notepad and multiply that by the number of notepads: 60 pages/notepad x 8 notepads = 480 pages Therefore, Bart bought 480 pages of notepads. The answer is 480.\n\n\nQ: Padma is trading cards with Robert. Padma started with 75 cards and traded 2 or her valuable ones for 10 of Robert's cards. Robert started with 88 of his own cards and traded another 8 of his cards for 15 of Padma's cards. How many cards were traded between both Padma and Robert?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Padma traded 2 of her cards for 10 of Robert's cards. This means she now has 75 - 2 + 10 = 83 cards, and Robert has 88 - 10 = 78 cards. Next, Robert traded 8 of his cards for 15 of Padma's cards. This means he now has 78 - 8 = 70 cards, and Padma has 83 - 15 = 68 cards. In total, Padma traded 2 + 15 = 17 cards, and Robert traded 10 + 8 = 18 cards. Therefore, the total number of cards traded between both Padma and Robert is 17 + 18 = 35 cards. The answer is 35.\n\n\n"
