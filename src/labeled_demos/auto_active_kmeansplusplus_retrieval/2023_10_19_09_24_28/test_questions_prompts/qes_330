  "test_question": "Q: Verna loves to eat fruit. She bought three apples at $1.50 each, five oranges at $0.80 each, and six peaches at $0.75 each.  If she gave $20, how much change did she receive?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Yanna bought ten shirts at $5 each and three pairs of sandals at $3 each.  How much change did she get back if she gave a one hundred dollar bill?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of the shirts. 10 shirts x $5 per shirt = $50 Next, let's calculate the total cost of the sandals. 3 pairs of sandals x $3 per pair = $9 Now, let's add the cost of the shirts and sandals together to find the total cost. $50 + $9 = $59 Yanna gave a $100 bill, so we need to subtract the total cost from $100 to find the change. $100 - $59 = $41 Therefore, Yanna received $41 in change. The answer is 41.\n\n\nQ: A fruit basket consists of 4 bananas, 3 apples, 24 strawberries, 2 avocados, and a bunch of grapes. One banana costs $1. An apple costs $2. 12 strawberries cost $4. An avocado costs $3, and half a bunch of grapes costs $2. What is the total cost of the fruit basket?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the bananas. Since one banana costs $1 and there are 4 bananas in the basket, the total cost of the bananas is 4 x $1 = $4. Next, we need to calculate the cost of the apples. Since one apple costs $2 and there are 3 apples in the basket, the total cost of the apples is 3 x $2 = $6. Now, let's calculate the cost of the strawberries. We know that 12 strawberries cost $4, so we can calculate the cost of 24 strawberries by multiplying the cost of 12 strawberries by 2. Therefore, the total cost of the strawberries is 2 x $4 = $8. Moving on to the avocados, we know that one avocado costs $3 and there are 2 avocados in the basket. Therefore, the total cost of the avocados is 2 x $3 = $6. Finally, we need to calculate the cost of the grapes. We know that half a bunch of grapes costs $2, but we don't know how many grapes are in the basket. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact cost of the grapes. Adding up the costs of all the other fruits, we get: $4 (bananas) + $6 (apples) + $8 (strawberries) + $6 (avocados) = $24 Therefore, the total cost of the fruit basket is $24 plus the cost of the grapes. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: A bag of dozen apples costs $14 and Brian has already spent $10 on kiwis and half that much on bananas. What's the maximum number of apples Brian can buy if he left his house with only $50 and needs to pay the $3.50 subway fare each way?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much money Brian has left after paying for the subway fare. He needs to pay $3.50 each way, so that's a total of $7 for the round trip. Therefore, he has $50 - $7 = $43 left to spend on groceries. Next, we need to figure out how much money Brian has already spent on bananas. We know he spent half as much on bananas as he did on kiwis, and he spent $10 on kiwis. So he spent $10 / 2 = $5 on bananas. Now we can subtract the amount Brian has already spent on kiwis and bananas from the total amount he has left to spend on groceries: $43 - $10 - $5 = $28. Finally, we need to figure out how many bags of apples Brian can buy with $28. We know that one bag of apples costs $14, so we can divide $28 by $14 to get the maximum number of bags of apples Brian can buy: $28 / $14 = 2. Therefore, the maximum number of bags of apples Brian can buy is 2. Since each bag contains a dozen apples, he can buy a total of 2 x 12 = 24 apples. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Betty bought 1 kg of oranges and 3 kg of apples. The total cost of oranges was $12. The apples were two times cheaper than the oranges. How much did Betty pay for 1 kg of apples?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the total cost of oranges was $12. We don't know the cost per kilogram of oranges, but we can figure it out by dividing the total cost by the amount of oranges Betty bought: Cost per kilogram of oranges = $12 \u00f7 1 kg = $12/kg Next, we know that the apples were two times cheaper than the oranges. This means that the cost per kilogram of apples is half the cost per kilogram of oranges: Cost per kilogram of apples = 1/2 \u00d7 $12/kg = $6/kg Therefore, Betty paid $6 for 1 kg of apples. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Apples used to cost $1.6 per pound.  The price got raised 25%.  How much does it cost to buy 2 pounds of apples for each person in a 4 member family?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Calculate the new price of apples after the 25% increase. The price increase is 25% of $1.6, which is (25/100) x $1.6 = $0.4. So, the new price of apples is $1.6 + $0.4 = $2. Step 2: Calculate the cost of buying 2 pounds of apples for each person in the family. Since there are 4 members in the family, we need to buy 2 x 4 = 8 pounds of apples in total. The cost of buying 1 pound of apples is $2, so the cost of buying 8 pounds of apples is 8 x $2 = $16. Therefore, it would cost $16 to buy 2 pounds of apples for each person in a 4 member family. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Francis and Kiera had breakfast at a cafe. Muffins cost $2 each, and fruit cups cost $3 each. Francis had 2 muffins and 2 fruit cups. Kiera had 2 muffins and 1 fruit cup. How much did their breakfast cost?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the cost of Francis's breakfast. 2 muffins cost 2 x $2 = $4 2 fruit cups cost 2 x $3 = $6 So Francis's breakfast cost $4 + $6 = $10 Now let's calculate the cost of Kiera's breakfast. 2 muffins cost 2 x $2 = $4 1 fruit cup costs $3 So Kiera's breakfast cost $4 + $3 = $7 Finally, let's add the cost of Francis's and Kiera's breakfast to find the total cost. $10 + $7 = $17 Therefore, their breakfast cost $17 in total. The answer is 17.\n\n\nQ: Ella has 4 bags with 20 apples in each bag and six bags with 25 apples in each bag. If Ella sells 200 apples, how many apples does Ella has left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many apples Ella has in total. She has 4 bags with 20 apples in each bag, so that's 4 x 20 = 80 apples. She also has 6 bags with 25 apples in each bag, so that's 6 x 25 = 150 apples. In total, Ella has 80 + 150 = 230 apples. If she sells 200 apples, we can subtract that from the total: 230 - 200 = 30 Therefore, Ella has 30 apples left. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how much money Carl will earn in four weeks. If he earns $0.50 every time, and he buys a candy bar each time, that means he's spending $0.50 each week. But he's also earning $0.75 each week for taking out his neighbor's trash. So his net earnings each week are $0.75 - $0.50 = $0.25. Over four weeks, that's a total of $0.25 x 4 = $1. So Carl will have $1 to spend on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.50, he can buy 2 candy bars with his earnings. The answer is 2.\n\n\n"
