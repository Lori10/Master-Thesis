  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Marly is making soup. He adds 2 quarts of milk and three times as much chicken stock to 1 quart of pureed vegetables. Then he divides the soup into bags that can hold 3 quarts each. How many bags does he need?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, Marly adds 2 quarts of milk and three times as much chicken stock to 1 quart of pureed vegetables. This means he adds 2 + 3(1) = 5 quarts of liquid to the vegetables. Next, Marly has a total of 5 + 1 = 6 quarts of soup. To find out how many bags he needs, we need to divide the total amount of soup by the amount each bag can hold. So, we have: 6 quarts \u00f7 3 quarts/bag = 2 bags Therefore, Marly needs 2 bags to hold all of his soup. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: In preparation for the church fundraiser, Julia bakes one less than 5 cakes per day for 6 days.  Unfortunately, every other day, Julia's brother, Clifford, sneaks into Julia's house and eats one of Julia's cakes.  At the end of 6 days, how many cakes does Julia have remaining?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cakes Julia bakes per day. We know that she bakes one less than 5 cakes per day, so that means she bakes 4 cakes per day. Next, we need to figure out how many cakes Julia bakes in total over the 6 days. To do this, we can multiply the number of cakes she bakes per day (4) by the number of days she bakes (6): 4 cakes/day x 6 days = 24 cakes So Julia bakes a total of 24 cakes over the 6 days. Now we need to figure out how many cakes Clifford eats. We know that he eats one of Julia's cakes every other day, so that means he eats 3 cakes over the 6 days (since there are 3 pairs of days where he eats a cake). Finally, we can subtract the number of cakes Clifford eats from the total number of cakes Julia bakes to find out how many cakes she has remaining: 24 cakes - 3 cakes = 21 cakes So Julia has 21 cakes remaining at the end of the 6 days. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: MIlle is making snack packs for her kindergarten class. She's going to divide 64 pretzels, four times as many goldfish, and 32 suckers into baggies for the 16 kids in the class. How many items does each baggie have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many goldfish there are. We know that there are four times as many goldfish as pretzels, so: 64 pretzels x 4 = 256 goldfish Next, we need to add up the total number of items: 64 pretzels + 256 goldfish + 32 suckers = 352 items Now we can divide the total number of items by the number of baggies: 352 items \u00f7 16 baggies = 22 items per baggie Therefore, each baggie will have 22 items, which includes pretzels, goldfish, and suckers. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Arthur has 3 dogs. They eat an average of 15 pounds of food a week. One dog eats 13 pounds a week. The second eats double this. How much does the third dog eat a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the total amount of food the three dogs eat in a week is 15 pounds per dog * 3 dogs = 45 pounds. Next, we know that one of the dogs eats 13 pounds per week. So, the other two dogs must eat a total of 45 pounds - 13 pounds = 32 pounds per week. We also know that the second dog eats double what the first dog eats, which is 13 pounds. So, the second dog eats 2 * 13 pounds = 26 pounds per week. To find out how much the third dog eats, we can subtract the amount the first and second dogs eat from the total amount of food the three dogs eat: 45 pounds - 13 pounds - 26 pounds = 6 pounds Therefore, the third dog eats 6 pounds of food per week. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Seth lost 17.5 pounds. Jerome lost three times that many pounds and Veronica lost 1.5 pounds more than Seth. How many pounds did the 3 people lose in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Seth lost 17.5 pounds. Next, we need to find out how much weight Jerome lost. We are told that Jerome lost three times as much weight as Seth, so we can multiply Seth's weight loss by 3: 17.5 x 3 = 52.5 So Jerome lost 52.5 pounds. Finally, we need to find out how much weight Veronica lost. We are told that she lost 1.5 pounds more than Seth, so we can add 1.5 to Seth's weight loss: 17.5 + 1.5 = 19 So Veronica lost 19 pounds. To find the total weight loss for all three people, we can add up their individual weight losses: 17.5 + 52.5 + 19 = 89 Therefore, the three people lost a total of 89 pounds. The answer is 89.\n\n\nQ: Melody has three dogs. Each dog eats 1/2 of a pound of dog food twice a day. If Melody bought 30 pounds of dog food, how many pounds of dog food are left after a week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much dog food each dog eats in a day. Since each dog eats 1/2 of a pound of dog food twice a day, each dog eats a total of 1 pound of dog food per day (1/2 + 1/2 = 1). So, three dogs would eat a total of 3 pounds of dog food per day (3 x 1 = 3). In a week, which is 7 days, the dogs would eat a total of 21 pounds of dog food (3 x 7 = 21). If Melody bought 30 pounds of dog food and the dogs ate 21 pounds in a week, then there would be 9 pounds of dog food left (30 - 21 = 9). Therefore, after a week, Melody would have 9 pounds of dog food left. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Rollo has 3 guinea pigs, the first guinea pig eats 2 cups of food, the second guinea pig eats twice as much as the first one, and the third guinea pig eats 3 cups more than the second one. How many cups of food does Rollo need to feed all his Guinea pigs?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the first guinea pig eats 2 cups of food. The second guinea pig eats twice as much as the first one, so it eats 2 x 2 = 4 cups of food. The third guinea pig eats 3 cups more than the second one, so it eats 4 + 3 = 7 cups of food. To find out how much food Rollo needs to feed all his guinea pigs, we add up the amount of food each guinea pig eats: 2 + 4 + 7 = 13 Therefore, Rollo needs 13 cups of food to feed all his guinea pigs. The answer is 13.\n\n\nQ: Twenty gallons of tea were poured into 80 containers. Geraldo drank 3.5 containers. How many pints of tea did Geraldo drink?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many gallons of tea Geraldo drank. We know that he drank 3.5 containers, and each container holds 1/4 gallon of tea (since 20 gallons were poured into 80 containers). So, Geraldo drank: 3.5 containers x 1/4 gallon per container = 7/8 gallon of tea Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so: 7/8 gallon x 8 pints per gallon = 7 pints Therefore, Geraldo drank 7 pints of tea. The answer is 7.\n\n\n"
