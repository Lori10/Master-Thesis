  "formatted_prompt": "Q: There are four lamps in Valerie's room. All of them are burnt out, so she needs to buy new light bulbs. She needs 3 small light bulbs and 1 large light bulb. She has $60 to spend. If small light bulbs cost $8 and large light bulbs cost $12, how much money will Valerie have left over?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total cost of the light bulbs Valerie needs to buy. The cost of 3 small light bulbs is: 3 x $8 = $24 The cost of 1 large light bulb is: 1 x $12 = $12 So the total cost is: $24 + $12 = $36 Next, we need to subtract the total cost from the amount of money Valerie has: $60 - $36 = $24 Therefore, Valerie will have $24 left over after buying the light bulbs. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: Stephanie is decorating 24 cupcakes for a birthday party, but she needs more candles. She currently has a total of 30 candles. She wants to decorate half of the cupcakes with 1 candle each and the other half of the cupcakes with 2 candles each. How many additional candles does Stephanie need to complete the cupcakes?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that Stephanie is decorating 24 cupcakes in total. Step 2: She wants to decorate half of the cupcakes with 1 candle each, which means she needs 12 candles for those cupcakes (12 cupcakes x 1 candle each = 12 candles). Step 3: She wants to decorate the other half of the cupcakes with 2 candles each, which means she needs 24 candles for those cupcakes (12 cupcakes x 2 candles each = 24 candles). Step 4: In total, she needs 36 candles (30 candles she already has + 12 candles for the first half of cupcakes + 24 candles for the second half of cupcakes = 66 candles). Step 5: To complete the cupcakes, Stephanie needs 6 more candles (36 candles needed - 30 candles she already has = 6 candles). The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: Noah\u2019s bedroom light uses 6 watts per hour. His office light is much brighter so he can see to work and uses three times as much energy. The living room light has a much larger space to cover and has to be more powerful, so it uses four times as much energy as his bedroom light. If Noah leaves all those lights on for two hours, how many watts has he used?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many watts Noah's office light uses per hour. We know that it uses three times as much energy as his bedroom light, which is 6 watts per hour. So, the office light uses 3 x 6 = 18 watts per hour. Next, we need to find out how many watts the living room light uses per hour. We know that it uses four times as much energy as his bedroom light, which is 6 watts per hour. So, the living room light uses 4 x 6 = 24 watts per hour. Now that we know the wattage per hour for each light, we can calculate the total watts used by multiplying the wattage per hour by the number of hours the lights were on. In this case, the lights were on for two hours, so: - Noah's bedroom light used 6 watts per hour x 2 hours = 12 watts - Noah's office light used 18 watts per hour x 2 hours = 36 watts - The living room light used 24 watts per hour x 2 hours = 48 watts Therefore, the total watts used by all three lights is 12 + 36 + 48 = 96 watts. The answer is 96.\n\n\nQ: On a moonless night, three fireflies danced in the evening breeze.  They were joined by four less than a dozen more fireflies, before two of the fireflies flew away.  How many fireflies remained?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there were three fireflies dancing. Then, four less than a dozen (which is 12) more fireflies joined them. So, we can add 12-4=8 fireflies to the original three, making a total of 11 fireflies. Next, two of the fireflies flew away, so we need to subtract 2 from the 11 fireflies. Therefore, the final answer is 11-2=9 fireflies remained. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Ethan makes beeswax candles.  For each candle, he uses 8 ounces of beeswax and 1 ounce of coconut oil.  If he makes three less than 10 candles, what will be the combined weight of the candles in ounces?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many candles Ethan makes. We know that he makes three less than 10 candles, so: 10 - 3 = 7 candles Next, we need to find out how much beeswax and coconut oil Ethan uses for each candle. We know that he uses 8 ounces of beeswax and 1 ounce of coconut oil for each candle, so: 8 + 1 = 9 ounces per candle Now we can find out the total weight of all the candles by multiplying the number of candles by the weight of each candle: 7 x 9 = 63 ounces Therefore, the combined weight of the candles in ounces will be 63 ounces. The answer is 63.\n\n\nQ: Jaylen has 5 carrots and 2 cucumbers. Jaylen has twice as many bell peppers as Kristin. Jaylen has 3 less than half as many green beans as Kristin. If Kristin has 2 bell peppers and 20 green beans, how many vegetables does Jaylen have in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bell peppers Jaylen has. We know that Jaylen has twice as many bell peppers as Kristin, and Kristin has 2 bell peppers. So, Jaylen has 2 x 2 = 4 bell peppers. Next, we need to find out how many green beans Jaylen has. We know that Jaylen has 3 less than half as many green beans as Kristin, and Kristin has 20 green beans. So, half of 20 is 10, and 3 less than 10 is 7. Therefore, Jaylen has 7 green beans. Now, we can add up all the vegetables Jaylen has: 5 carrots + 2 cucumbers + 4 bell peppers + 7 green beans = 18 vegetables in total. The answer is 18.\n\n\nQ: There are four members in one household. Each member consumes 3 slices of bread during breakfast and 2 slices of bread for snacks. A loaf of bread has 12 slices. How many days will five loaves of bread last in this family?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many slices of bread each member consumes per day. For breakfast, each member consumes 3 slices of bread. For snacks, each member consumes 2 slices of bread. So, in total, each member consumes 3 + 2 = 5 slices of bread per day. Since there are four members in the household, the total number of slices of bread consumed per day is 4 x 5 = 20 slices. Now, we need to find out how many days five loaves of bread will last. One loaf of bread has 12 slices, so five loaves of bread have 5 x 12 = 60 slices. If the family consumes 20 slices of bread per day, then 60 slices will last for 60/20 = 3 days. Therefore, five loaves of bread will last for 3 days in this family. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: A performing magician has a disappearing act where he makes a random member of his audience disappear and reappear. Unfortunately, one-tenth of the time, the audience member never reappears. However, one-fifth of the time, two people reappear instead of only one. If the magician has put on 100 performances of the act this year, how many people have reappeared?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people disappear in total. Since the magician chooses a random member of the audience each time, we can assume that one person disappears per performance. Therefore, 100 people have disappeared in total. Next, we need to find out how many times one person reappears. We know that one-tenth of the time, the person never reappears, so that means nine-tenths of the time, they do reappear. Therefore, 90 people have reappeared once. Finally, we need to find out how many times two people reappear. We know that one-fifth of the time, this happens. Since there were 100 performances in total, this means that 20 times, two people reappeared. Therefore, 40 people have reappeared twice. To find the total number of people who have reappeared, we add the number of people who have reappeared once to the number of people who have reappeared twice: 90 + 40 = 130 Therefore, 130 people have reappeared in total. The answer is 130.\n\n\n"
