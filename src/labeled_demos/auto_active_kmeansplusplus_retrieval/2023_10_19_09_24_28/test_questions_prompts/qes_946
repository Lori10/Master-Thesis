  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Marla has a grid of squares that has 10 rows and 15 squares in each row. She colors 4 rows of 6 squares in the middle of the grid with red. She colors all squares on the first 2 and last 2 rows with blue. Then she colors the rest with green. How many squares does Marla color green?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of squares in the grid. We can do this by multiplying the number of rows by the number of squares in each row: 10 rows x 15 squares/row = 150 squares Next, we need to find the number of squares that Marla colors red. She colors 4 rows of 6 squares each, so: 4 rows x 6 squares/row = 24 squares Now we need to find the number of squares that Marla colors blue. She colors the first 2 and last 2 rows, which means she colors a total of: 2 rows x 15 squares/row + 2 rows x 15 squares/row = 60 squares Finally, we can subtract the number of red and blue squares from the total number of squares to find the number of green squares: 150 total squares - 24 red squares - 60 blue squares = 66 green squares Therefore, Marla colors 66 squares green. The answer is 66.\n\n\nQ: 7 out of 40 people in a cafeteria are wearing checkered shirts. The rest of the people are wearing vertical stripes and horizontal stripes. The number of people wearing horizontal stripes is 4 times as many as the people wearing checkered shirts. How many people are wearing vertical stripes?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that 7 out of 40 people are wearing checkered shirts. So, the number of people wearing horizontal and vertical stripes is 40 - 7 = 33. Step 2: We also know that the number of people wearing horizontal stripes is 4 times as many as the people wearing checkered shirts. So, the number of people wearing horizontal stripes is 4 x 7 = 28. Step 3: To find the number of people wearing vertical stripes, we can subtract the number of people wearing checkered and horizontal stripes from the total number of people. So, the number of people wearing vertical stripes is 33 - 7 - 28 = 6. Therefore, there are 6 people wearing vertical stripes in the cafeteria. The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: June made a design with 20 equal tiles. Three tiles are yellow and the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles. Six tiles are purple and the remaining tiles are white.  How many white tiles are there?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 3 yellow tiles. Next, we know that the number of blue tiles is one more than the number of yellow tiles, so there are 3+1=4 blue tiles. Then, we know that there are 6 purple tiles. So far, we have accounted for 3+4+6=13 tiles. Since there are 20 tiles in total, we can subtract 13 from 20 to find the number of white tiles: 20-13=7 Therefore, there are 7 white tiles in June's design. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Eight people fit in a row on an airplane, and there are 12 rows. Only 3/4 of the seats in each row are allowed to be seated. How many seats will not be occupied on that plane?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many seats are in each row. Since only 3/4 of the seats in each row are allowed to be seated, we can multiply the number of seats in each row by 3/4 to find out how many seats are available in each row. Number of seats in each row = 8 x 3/4 = 6 Next, we need to find out how many seats are available on the plane. To do this, we can multiply the number of seats in each row by the number of rows. Number of seats on the plane = 6 x 12 = 72 Finally, we need to find out how many seats will not be occupied on the plane. To do this, we can subtract the number of passengers from the total number of seats. Number of seats not occupied = 72 - (8 x 12) = 72 - 96 = -24 Since we cannot have negative seats, we can conclude that all seats on the plane will be occupied. The answer is -24.\n\n\nQ: On a moonless night, three fireflies danced in the evening breeze.  They were joined by four less than a dozen more fireflies, before two of the fireflies flew away.  How many fireflies remained?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there were three fireflies dancing. Then, four less than a dozen (which is 12) more fireflies joined them. So, we can add 12-4=8 fireflies to the original three, making a total of 11 fireflies. Next, two of the fireflies flew away, so we need to subtract 2 from the 11 fireflies. Therefore, the final answer is 11-2=9 fireflies remained. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Betsy is sewing a quilt.  The quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side.  Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together.  How many more squares does she need to sew together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many squares Betsy has already sewn together. If the quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side, then the total number of squares in the quilt is: 16 x 16 = 256 squares If Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together, then she has sewn: 0.25 x 256 = 64 squares Now we need to find out how many more squares she needs to sew together. To do this, we can subtract the number of squares she has already sewn from the total number of squares in the quilt: 256 - 64 = 192 squares So Betsy still needs to sew together 192 squares to complete the quilt. The answer is 192.\n\n\nQ: Penelope has 5 M&M candies for every 3 Starbursts candies. If she has 25 M&M candies, how many Starbursts candies does she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out the ratio of M&M candies to Starbursts candies. According to the problem, Penelope has 5 M&M candies for every 3 Starbursts candies. This can be written as: 5 M&M candies : 3 Starbursts candies Next, we need to use this ratio to figure out how many Starbursts candies Penelope has. We know that she has 25 M&M candies, so we can set up a proportion: 5 M&M candies / 3 Starbursts candies = 25 M&M candies / x Starbursts candies To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 5 M&M candies * x Starbursts candies = 3 Starbursts candies * 25 M&M candies 5x = 75 x = 15 Therefore, Penelope has 15 Starbursts candies. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Eric has 20 marbles. He has 12 white marbles, 6 blue marbles, and the rest are green marbles. How many green marbles does Eric have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Eric has a total of 20 marbles. Out of those 20 marbles, he has 12 white marbles and 6 blue marbles. To find out how many green marbles he has, we need to subtract the number of white and blue marbles from the total number of marbles: 20 - 12 - 6 = 2 Therefore, Eric has 2 green marbles. The answer is 2.\n\n\n"
