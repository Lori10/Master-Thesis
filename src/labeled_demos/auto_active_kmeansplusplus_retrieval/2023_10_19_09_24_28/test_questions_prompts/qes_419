  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A big box store sees 175 people enter their store every hour.  This number doubles during the holiday season.  During the holiday season, how many customers will this big box store see in 8 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers the store sees in one hour during the holiday season. To do this, we can double the number of customers the store sees in a regular hour: 175 x 2 = 350 So during the holiday season, the store sees 350 customers per hour. Next, we need to find out how many customers the store will see in 8 hours during the holiday season. To do this, we can multiply the number of customers per hour by the number of hours: 350 x 8 = 2800 Therefore, during the holiday season, the big box store will see 2800 customers in 8 hours. The answer is 8.\n\n\nQ: Ann, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers each woman serves in 8 hours: Ann: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Becky: 7 customers/hour x 8 hours = 56 customers Julia: 7 customers/hour x 6 hours = 42 customers Now we can add up the number of customers served by all three women: 56 customers + 56 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers Therefore, all three women served 154 customers that day in total. The answer is 154.\n\n\nQ: Merry had 50 boxes of apples on Saturday and 25 boxes on Sunday. There were 10 apples in each box. If she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, how many boxes of apples are left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many apples Merry had in total. On Saturday, she had 50 boxes of apples, and each box had 10 apples, so she had 50 x 10 = 500 apples on Saturday. On Sunday, she had 25 boxes of apples, and each box had 10 apples, so she had 25 x 10 = 250 apples on Sunday. In total, she had 500 + 250 = 750 apples. Next, we need to find out how many apples she sold. We know that she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, so she must have had 750 - 720 = 30 apples left. Finally, we need to find out how many boxes of apples she has left. We know that there are 10 apples in each box, so she must have 30 / 10 = 3 boxes of apples left. Therefore, Merry has 3 boxes of apples left. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Los Angeles has 6 million people living in it. If half the population is women and 1/3 of the women work in retail, how many women work in retail in Los Angeles?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of women in Los Angeles. Half of the population is women, so we can calculate: 6 million / 2 = 3 million women Step 2: Find the number of women who work in retail. One-third of the women work in retail, so we can calculate: 3 million / 3 = 1 million women work in retail Therefore, there are 1 million women who work in retail in Los Angeles. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many animals Mary counted in total. She double-counted 7 sheep, so we can subtract 7 from the total count to get the actual number of sheep: 60 - 7 = 53 However, Mary forgot to count 3 pigs, so we need to add those back in: 53 + 3 = 56 Therefore, there are actually 56 animals in the petting zoo. The answer is 56.\n\n\nQ: Mary has 26 blue shirts and 36 brown shirts. If she gives away half of her blue shirts and a third of her brown shirts, how many shirts does she have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many blue shirts Mary gives away. Half of her blue shirts would be: 26 / 2 = 13 So Mary gives away 13 blue shirts. Next, we need to find out how many brown shirts Mary gives away. A third of her brown shirts would be: 36 / 3 = 12 So Mary gives away 12 brown shirts. Now we can find out how many shirts Mary has left. She started with 26 blue shirts and gave away 13, so she has: 26 - 13 = 13 blue shirts left She started with 36 brown shirts and gave away 12, so she has: 36 - 12 = 24 brown shirts left Therefore, Mary has 13 + 24 = 37 shirts left. The answer is 37.\n\n\nQ: A performing magician has a disappearing act where he makes a random member of his audience disappear and reappear. Unfortunately, one-tenth of the time, the audience member never reappears. However, one-fifth of the time, two people reappear instead of only one. If the magician has put on 100 performances of the act this year, how many people have reappeared?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people disappear in total. Since the magician chooses a random member of the audience each time, we can assume that one person disappears per performance. Therefore, 100 people have disappeared in total. Next, we need to find out how many times one person reappears. We know that one-tenth of the time, the person never reappears, so that means nine-tenths of the time, they do reappear. Therefore, 90 people have reappeared once. Finally, we need to find out how many times two people reappear. We know that one-fifth of the time, this happens. Since there were 100 performances in total, this means that 20 times, two people reappeared. Therefore, 40 people have reappeared twice. To find the total number of people who have reappeared, we add the number of people who have reappeared once to the number of people who have reappeared twice: 90 + 40 = 130 Therefore, 130 people have reappeared in total. The answer is 130.\n\n\nQ: Anna is making gingerbread cookies. She gives 6 of them red hats, 9 of them blue boots, and 3 of them both red hats and blue boots. What percentage of the gingerbread men have red hats?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many gingerbread men there are in total. We can do this by adding the number of gingerbread men with red hats (6) to the number of gingerbread men with blue boots (9), and then subtracting the number of gingerbread men with both red hats and blue boots (3): 6 + 9 - 3 = 12 So there are 12 gingerbread men in total. Next, we need to find out how many of these gingerbread men have red hats. We already know that 6 of them have red hats and 3 of them have both red hats and blue boots. So we can subtract the 3 from the 6 to get the number of gingerbread men with only red hats: 6 - 3 = 3 Therefore, 3 gingerbread men have only red hats. To find the percentage of gingerbread men with red hats, we can divide the number of gingerbread men with only red hats (3) by the total number of gingerbread men (12), and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage: (3/12) x 100 = 25% So 25% of the gingerbread men have red hats. The answer is 25.\n\n\n"
