  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Jim has 2 rows of 4 trees to start.  When he turns 10 he decides to plant a new row of trees every year on his birthday.  On his 15th birthday after he doubles the number of trees he has.  How many trees does he have?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller steps. Step 1: Jim starts with 2 rows of 4 trees each, so he has a total of 2 x 4 = 8 trees. Step 2: Jim plants a new row of trees every year on his birthday, starting from his 10th birthday. So, he plants trees for 15 - 10 = 5 years. Step 3: In these 5 years, Jim plants 5 new rows of trees, one row each year. Step 4: Therefore, Jim now has a total of 2 + 5 = 7 rows of trees. Step 5: Each row has 4 trees, so Jim has a total of 7 x 4 = 28 trees. Step 6: On his 15th birthday, Jim doubles the number of trees he has. So, he now has 28 x 2 = 56 trees. Therefore, Jim has 56 trees after he doubles the number of trees he has on his 15th birthday. The answer is 15.\n\n\nQ: Theresa has 5 more than thrice as many video games as Julia. Julia has a third as many video games as Tory. If Tory has 6 video games, how many video games does Theresa have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many video games Julia has. We know that Julia has a third as many video games as Tory, who has 6 video games. So, Julia has 6/3 = 2 video games. Next, we need to find out how many video games Theresa has. We know that Theresa has 5 more than thrice as many video games as Julia. So, we can write an equation: Theresa's video games = 5 + 3 * Julia's video games Substituting Julia's video games with 2, we get: Theresa's video games = 5 + 3 * 2 Theresa's video games = 11 Therefore, Theresa has 11 video games. The answer is 11.\n\n\nQ: There are four growing trees. The first tree grows 1 meter/day, the second grows the same amount in half the time, the third grows 2 meters/day, and the fourth tree grows a meter more than the third each day. How many meters did the trees grow in total in 4 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much the second tree grows per day. Since it grows the same amount as the first tree in half the time, it grows 2 meters/day. Now we can calculate how much each tree grows in 4 days: - The first tree grows 1 meter/day, so in 4 days it grows 4 meters. - The second tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The third tree grows 2 meters/day, so in 4 days it grows 8 meters. - The fourth tree grows 1 meter more than the third each day, so it grows 3 meters/day. In 4 days it grows 12 meters. Adding up the growth of all four trees, we get: 4 + 8 + 8 + 12 = 32 meters Therefore, the trees grew a total of 32 meters in 4 days. The answer is 4.\n\n\nQ: Ivan has 20 dice. Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. How many dice do they have altogether?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Ivan has 20 dice. Next, we know that Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. So, we can multiply Ivan's number of dice by 2 to find Jerry's number of dice: 20 x 2 = 40 Therefore, Jerry has 40 dice. To find the total number of dice they have altogether, we can add Ivan's and Jerry's number of dice: 20 + 40 = 60 Therefore, they have 60 dice altogether. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: James and 4 of his friends volunteered to plant flowers. In 2 days, they were able to plant a total of 200 flowers. If each of them planted the same number of flowers, how many flowers did James plant in a day?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people were planting flowers. We know that James and 4 of his friends volunteered, so there were 5 people in total. Next, we need to find out how many flowers each person planted in 2 days. To do this, we can divide the total number of flowers planted (200) by the number of people (5) and the number of days (2): 200 \u00f7 5 \u00f7 2 = 20 So each person planted 20 flowers in 2 days. Finally, we need to find out how many flowers James planted in 1 day. Since each person planted 20 flowers in 2 days, we can divide that by 2 to find out how many flowers each person planted in 1 day: 20 \u00f7 2 = 10 Therefore, James planted 10 flowers in 1 day. The answer is 1.\n\n\nQ: James has a small tree outside his window with 30 branches with 90 twigs per branch. 30% of the twigs sprout 4 leaves and the rest sprout 5 leaves. How many leaves are on the tree total?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of twigs on the tree. We know that there are 30 branches with 90 twigs per branch, so: 30 branches x 90 twigs per branch = 2700 twigs Next, we need to find how many twigs sprout 4 leaves and how many sprout 5 leaves. We know that 30% of the twigs sprout 4 leaves, so: 30% of 2700 twigs = 0.3 x 2700 = 810 twigs sprout 4 leaves The remaining twigs sprout 5 leaves: 2700 twigs - 810 twigs = 1890 twigs sprout 5 leaves Now we can find the total number of leaves on the tree. Each twig that sprouts 4 leaves contributes 4 leaves, and each twig that sprouts 5 leaves contributes 5 leaves. So: 810 twigs x 4 leaves per twig = 3240 leaves from twigs that sprout 4 leaves 1890 twigs x 5 leaves per twig = 9450 leaves from twigs that sprout 5 leaves The total number of leaves on the tree is: 3240 leaves + 9450 leaves = 12690 leaves Therefore, there are 12690 leaves on the tree in total. The answer is 12690.\n\n\nQ: A zoo has 8 parrots. It 3 times the number of snakes than parrots and 2 times the number of monkeys than snakes. The number of elephants is half the number of parrots and snakes added up, and there are 3 fewer zebras than elephants. What is the difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the zoo has 8 parrots. Next, we are told that there are 3 times as many snakes as parrots. So, the number of snakes would be 3 x 8 = 24. Then, we are told that there are 2 times as many monkeys as snakes. So, the number of monkeys would be 2 x 24 = 48. The number of elephants is half the number of parrots and snakes added up. So, the number of elephants would be (8 + 24) / 2 = 16. Finally, we are told that there are 3 fewer zebras than elephants. So, the number of zebras would be 16 - 3 = 13. The difference between the number of zebras and monkeys would be 48 - 13 = 35. Therefore, the difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys is 35. The answer is 35.\n\n\nQ: Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. If Mabel has 85 marbles, how many more marbles does Mabel have than Amanda?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Katrina has. We know that Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 85 marbles, so we can set up an equation: Mabel's marbles = 5 x Katrina's marbles 85 = 5 x Katrina's marbles Katrina's marbles = 17 Now we know that Katrina has 17 marbles. We also know that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. So we can set up another equation: Amanda's marbles = 2 x Katrina's marbles + 12 Amanda's marbles = 2 x 17 + 12 Amanda's marbles = 46 So Amanda has 46 marbles. Finally, we can figure out how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda: Mabel's marbles - Amanda's marbles = 85 - 46 Mabel's marbles - Amanda's marbles = 39 Therefore, Mabel has 39 more marbles than Amanda. The answer is 39.\n\n\n"
