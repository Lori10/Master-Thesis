  "test_question": "Q: Two track teams are competing against each other in a 4 by 400 meter relay; a race where each competing team has four members that each run 400 meters, or one lap, around a standard track.  One of the two teams is very well-rounded and each of their members will run their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds.  The other team is less well-rounded; their first runner will run their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds then each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous runner.  Using this information, how many seconds will the faster team win by?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Albert has to run 99 meters in gym class. The track is 9 meters around. He has already run 6 times around it. Once he finishes, how many more complete laps will he have made around the track?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many meters Albert has already run. We know that he has run 6 times around the track, and the track is 9 meters around, so: 6 x 9 = 54 meters Albert has already run 54 meters. Next, we need to find out how many meters he still needs to run: 99 - 54 = 45 meters Now we need to figure out how many complete laps he can make with the remaining 45 meters. Since the track is 9 meters around, we can divide 45 by 9 to find out how many complete laps he can make: 45 \u00f7 9 = 5 Albert can make 5 more complete laps around the track once he finishes. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Silvio was running a race that had 4 parts. The total length of the race was 74.5 kilometers. The first part of the race is 15.5 kilometers long. The second and third parts are each 21.5 kilometers long. How many kilometers is the last part of the race?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to add up the lengths of the first three parts of the race: 15.5 km + 21.5 km + 21.5 km = 58.5 km We know that the total length of the race is 74.5 km, so we can subtract the sum of the first three parts from the total length to find the length of the last part: 74.5 km - 58.5 km = 16 km Therefore, the last part of the race is 16 kilometers long. The answer is 16.\n\n\nQ: Carlos and Diego are racing around the block. Carlos runs around the entire block in 3 minutes. Diego runs around half the block in 2.5 minutes and then is tripped by a dog and can't finish. Assuming he kept up the same speed the entire race, what would've been the average time in seconds for the racers?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Diego to run the entire block. Since he runs half the block in 2.5 minutes, we can use proportion to find out: 2.5 minutes = 1/2 block x minutes = 1 block Cross-multiplying, we get: 2.5 * 2 = x * 1 5 = x So it would take Diego 5 minutes to run the entire block if he hadn't been tripped. Now we can find the average time for the racers. We add up the time it took Carlos and the time it would've taken Diego, and divide by the number of racers: (3 minutes + 5 minutes) / 2 racers = 4 minutes But the question asks for the answer in seconds, so we need to convert minutes to seconds: 4 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 240 seconds So the average time for the racers would've been 240 seconds. The answer is 240.\n\n\nQ: Colin ran his first mile in 6 minutes.  He ran his next two miles in 5 minutes each and finished his 4th mile in 4 minutes.  What was the average time it took him to run a mile?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total time it took Colin to run all four miles. - Colin's first mile took 6 minutes. - His next two miles took 5 minutes each, so that's a total of 10 minutes. - His fourth mile took 4 minutes. To find the total time, we add these up: 6 + 10 + 4 = 20 So Colin ran four miles in a total of 20 minutes. To find the average time it took him to run a mile, we divide the total time by the number of miles: 20 / 4 = 5 So Colin's average time to run a mile was 5 minutes. The answer is 5.\n\n\nQ: Micah, Dean, and Jake are all training for a marathon organized by a local NGO to support children in their town who have cancer. Micah runs 2/3 times as fast as Dean. It takes Jake 1/3 times more time to finish the marathon than it takes Mica. If Dean takes 9 hours, what's the total time the three take to complete the marathon?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Micah to finish the marathon since we know that he runs 2/3 times as fast as Dean. If Dean takes 9 hours, then Micah takes 2/3 * 9 = 6 hours to finish the marathon. Next, we need to find out how long it takes Jake to finish the marathon since we know that it takes him 1/3 times more time than Micah. If Micah takes 6 hours, then Jake takes 6 + (1/3 * 6) = 8 hours to finish the marathon. Finally, we can add up the times it takes each person to finish the marathon to get the total time. So, the total time the three take to complete the marathon is 9 + 6 + 8 = 23 hours. The answer is 23.\n\n\nQ: Charlie can make 5350 steps while running on a 3-kilometer running field. If he can run around the field 2 1/2 times during a running session, how many steps was he able to make?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many steps Charlie takes per kilometer. To do this, we can divide the total number of steps (5350) by the distance he runs (3 kilometers): 5350 steps \u00f7 3 kilometers = 1783.33 steps/kilometer Next, we need to find out how far Charlie runs during one lap around the field. We know that he runs around the field 2 1/2 times, which is the same as 2.5 laps. Since the field is 3 kilometers long, one lap around the field is: 3 kilometers/lap So, 2.5 laps around the field is: 2.5 laps x 3 kilometers/lap = 7.5 kilometers Finally, we can use the steps per kilometer ratio we found earlier to calculate how many steps Charlie takes during 7.5 kilometers: 1783.33 steps/kilometer x 7.5 kilometers = 13375 steps Therefore, Charlie was able to make 13375 steps during his running session. The answer is 13375.\n\n\nQ: A train takes 4 hours to reach a destination at a speed of 50 miles per hour. How long would it take if it traveled at 100 miles per hour instead?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time We know that the distance is the same in both scenarios, so we can set the two equations equal to each other: 50 miles/hour x 4 hours = 100 miles/hour x time Simplifying this equation, we get: 200 miles = 100 miles/hour x time Dividing both sides by 100 miles/hour, we get: time = 2 hours Therefore, if the train traveled at 100 miles per hour instead of 50 miles per hour, it would take 2 hours to reach the destination. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Yvonne swims 10 laps in 5 minutes.  Her younger sister can swim half as many laps as Yvonne in the same time frame.  Their brother Joel can swim three times the number of laps as the youngest sister.  How many laps can Joel swim?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many laps Yvonne's younger sister can swim in 5 minutes. Since she can swim half as many laps as Yvonne, we can divide Yvonne's number of laps by 2: Yvonne's sister = 10 laps / 2 = 5 laps Next, we need to figure out how many laps Joel can swim. We know that he can swim three times the number of laps as the youngest sister, so we can multiply her number of laps by 3: Joel = 5 laps * 3 = 15 laps Therefore, Joel can swim 15 laps in 5 minutes. The answer is 5.\n\n\n"
