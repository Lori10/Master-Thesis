  "test_question": "Q: Jim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed. He needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, which measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. How many square feet of fabric does Jim need to buy?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Cynthia wants floor-to-ceiling curtains made with an additional 5\" of material so it will pool at the bottom. If her room is 8 feet tall, how long will the curtains need to be?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 8 feet to inches since the additional 5 inches will be added to the length. 8 feet = 96 inches Next, we add the additional 5 inches: 96 inches + 5 inches = 101 inches Therefore, the curtains will need to be 101 inches long. The answer is 101.\n\n\nQ: Betsy is sewing a quilt.  The quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side.  Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together.  How many more squares does she need to sew together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many squares Betsy has already sewn together. If the quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side, then the total number of squares in the quilt is: 16 x 16 = 256 squares If Betsy has already sewn 25% of the quilt together, then she has sewn: 0.25 x 256 = 64 squares Now we need to find out how many more squares she needs to sew together. To do this, we can subtract the number of squares she has already sewn from the total number of squares in the quilt: 256 - 64 = 192 squares So Betsy still needs to sew together 192 squares to complete the quilt. The answer is 192.\n\n\nQ: James paints a 20 ft by 15 ft mural.  It takes him 20 minutes to paint 1 square foot and he charges $150 per hour.  How much does he charge to paint the mural?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total area of the mural. We can do this by multiplying the length and width: 20 ft x 15 ft = 300 sq ft Next, we need to find how long it takes James to paint the entire mural. Since he can paint 1 sq ft in 20 minutes, he can paint 300 sq ft in: 300 sq ft x 20 minutes/sq ft = 6000 minutes Now we need to convert the time to hours, since James charges by the hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so: 6000 minutes \u00f7 60 minutes/hour = 100 hours Finally, we can calculate how much James charges for the job by multiplying the number of hours by his hourly rate: 100 hours x $150/hour = $15,000 Therefore, James charges $15,000 to paint the mural. The answer is 15000.\n\n\nQ: Lucas wants to get a dog but his parents think he already has too many pets and won't have enough space. He already has 12 pet beds in his room but manages to fit another 8 pet beds. His parents argue that each pet is going to need 2 beds each to feel comfortable. According to his parent's argument, how many pets does Lucas have enough room for?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pet beds Lucas has in total after adding the 8 new ones. 12 + 8 = 20 pet beds Next, we need to divide the total number of pet beds by 2 to find out how many pets can be accommodated. 20 \u00f7 2 = 10 pets Therefore, according to his parent's argument, Lucas has enough room for 10 pets. The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Gerald is a furniture maker. He has 672 pieces of wood and he wants to make some tables and chairs. It takes 12 pieces of wood to make a table and 8 pieces of wood to make a chair. How many chairs can he make if he makes 24 tables?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many pieces of wood Gerald will use to make 24 tables. To make one table, he needs 12 pieces of wood. So to make 24 tables, he will need: 12 x 24 = 288 pieces of wood Now, let's subtract the pieces of wood used for the tables from the total number of pieces of wood Gerald has: 672 - 288 = 384 pieces of wood left Finally, let's find out how many chairs Gerald can make with the remaining pieces of wood. To make one chair, he needs 8 pieces of wood. So the number of chairs he can make is: 384 \u00f7 8 = 48 chairs Therefore, Gerald can make 48 chairs if he makes 24 tables. The answer is 24.\n\n\nQ: May can knit 3 scarves using one yarn. She bought 2 red yarns, 6 blue yarns, and 4 yellow yarns. How many scarves will she be able to make in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. May can knit 3 scarves using one yarn. So, with 2 red yarns, she can knit 2 x 3 = 6 red scarves. With 6 blue yarns, she can knit 6 x 3 = 18 blue scarves. And with 4 yellow yarns, she can knit 4 x 3 = 12 yellow scarves. Therefore, in total, May will be able to make 6 + 18 + 12 = 36 scarves. The answer is 36.\n\n\nQ: It takes Omar 12 minutes to raise his kite 240 feet into the air. Jasper can raise his kite at three times the rate of speed as Omar can raise his kite. If Jasper raises his kite to a height of 600 feet, how many minutes will it take?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Jasper to raise his kite to a height of 240 feet, like Omar did. We know that Omar takes 12 minutes to raise his kite 240 feet, so we can set up a proportion: 12 minutes / 240 feet = x minutes / 600 feet To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 12 minutes * 600 feet = 240 feet * x minutes 7200 = 240x x = 30 So it would take Jasper 30 minutes to raise his kite to a height of 600 feet. The answer is 600.\n\n\nQ: Marla has a grid of squares that has 10 rows and 15 squares in each row. She colors 4 rows of 6 squares in the middle of the grid with red. She colors all squares on the first 2 and last 2 rows with blue. Then she colors the rest with green. How many squares does Marla color green?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of squares in the grid. We can do this by multiplying the number of rows by the number of squares in each row: 10 rows x 15 squares/row = 150 squares Next, we need to find the number of squares that Marla colors red. She colors 4 rows of 6 squares each, so: 4 rows x 6 squares/row = 24 squares Now we need to find the number of squares that Marla colors blue. She colors the first 2 and last 2 rows, which means she colors a total of: 2 rows x 15 squares/row + 2 rows x 15 squares/row = 60 squares Finally, we can subtract the number of red and blue squares from the total number of squares to find the number of green squares: 150 total squares - 24 red squares - 60 blue squares = 66 green squares Therefore, Marla colors 66 squares green. The answer is 66.\n\n\n"
