  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Eric sorted 150 colored pencils into 5 containers for his art class. Before class, another teacher brought him 30 more pencils. How many can he evenly distribute between the five containers now?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of pencils Eric has now. To do this, we add the original 150 pencils to the 30 pencils brought by the other teacher: 150 + 30 = 180 So Eric now has 180 colored pencils. Next, we need to find out how many pencils he can evenly distribute between the five containers. To do this, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of containers: 180 \u00f7 5 = 36 Therefore, Eric can evenly distribute 36 colored pencils between each of the five containers. The answer is 36.\n\n\nQ: Miriam currently has 30 marbles, but she used to have more. Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, gave her sister twice that amount and gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has. How many marbles did Miriam start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, so she now has 30 - 60 = -30 marbles. This doesn't make sense, so we know that Miriam must have started with more than 60 marbles. Next, we know that Miriam gave her sister twice the amount she gave her brother, so her sister received 2 * 60 = 120 marbles. We also know that Miriam gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has, so Savanna received 3 * 30 = 90 marbles. In total, Miriam gave away 60 + 120 + 90 = 270 marbles. If Miriam started with x marbles, we can set up the equation: x - 270 = 30 Solving for x, we get: x = 300 Therefore, Miriam started with 300 marbles. The answer is 300.\n\n\nQ: Peggy fell off her bike and skinned her knees.  She needed two bandages on her left knee and three bandages on her right knee.  If the box of bandages had 8 less than two dozen bandages before Peggy skinned her knees, how many bandages were left in the box after Peggy finished putting bandages on her knees?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many bandages Peggy used in total. We know she used two on her left knee and three on her right knee, so: 2 + 3 = 5 Peggy used 5 bandages in total. Next, we need to figure out how many bandages were in the box before Peggy used any. We know the box had 8 less than two dozen bandages, which means: 2 dozen = 24 24 - 8 = 16 There were 16 bandages in the box before Peggy used any. Finally, we need to figure out how many bandages were left in the box after Peggy used 5. We can do this by subtracting 5 from 16: 16 - 5 = 11 There were 11 bandages left in the box after Peggy finished putting bandages on her knees. The answer is 11.\n\n\nQ: There are 50 marbles in a box which has a mixture of white, red and blue marbles. There were originally 20 white marbles and an equal number of red and blue marbles. Jack removes a number of marbles equal to double the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles. How many marbles are left in the box?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 20 white marbles and an equal number of red and blue marbles. So, we can say that there are 20 white, 15 red, and 15 blue marbles in the box. Next, we need to find the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles. In this case, the difference is 20 - 15 = 5. Then, we need to double that difference, which gives us 5 x 2 = 10. Jack removes 10 marbles from the box. So, the number of marbles left in the box is 50 - 10 = 40 marbles. The answer is 40.\n\n\nQ: Merry had 50 boxes of apples on Saturday and 25 boxes on Sunday. There were 10 apples in each box. If she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, how many boxes of apples are left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many apples Merry had in total. On Saturday, she had 50 boxes of apples, and each box had 10 apples, so she had 50 x 10 = 500 apples on Saturday. On Sunday, she had 25 boxes of apples, and each box had 10 apples, so she had 25 x 10 = 250 apples on Sunday. In total, she had 500 + 250 = 750 apples. Next, we need to find out how many apples she sold. We know that she sold a total of 720 apples on Saturday and Sunday, so she must have had 750 - 720 = 30 apples left. Finally, we need to find out how many boxes of apples she has left. We know that there are 10 apples in each box, so she must have 30 / 10 = 3 boxes of apples left. Therefore, Merry has 3 boxes of apples left. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Betty has 20 books, and her sister has 1/4 times more books than Betty. What's the total number of books the two have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many books Betty's sister has. To do this, we can take 1/4 of Betty's number of books and add it to Betty's number of books. 1/4 of 20 books is (1/4) x 20 = 5 books. So Betty's sister has 20 + 5 = 25 books. To find the total number of books the two have, we can add Betty's number of books to her sister's number of books: 20 + 25 = 45 books. Therefore, the two sisters have a total of 45 books. The answer is 45.\n\n\nQ: There were 90 jellybeans in a jar. Samantha snuck 24 jellybeans out of the jar, without being seen. Shelby ate 12 jellybeans from the jar. Their mom, Shannon, refilled the jar with half as much as Samantha and Shelby took out. How many jellybeans are in the jar now?\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Samantha took out 24 jellybeans from the jar. Step 2: Shelby ate 12 jellybeans from the jar. Step 3: The total number of jellybeans taken out of the jar is 24 + 12 = 36. Step 4: Shannon refilled the jar with half as much as Samantha and Shelby took out, which is 1/2 * 36 = 18 jellybeans. Step 5: The total number of jellybeans in the jar now is 90 - 36 + 18 = 72 jellybeans. Therefore, there are 72 jellybeans in the jar now. The answer is 72.\n\n\nQ: Nori had 4 boxes of crayons with 8 crayons in each box. She gave 5 crayons to Mae and also give some crayons to Lea. How many more crayons did she give to Lea than Mae if she has only 15 crayons left?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many crayons Nori had in total. 4 boxes x 8 crayons per box = 32 crayons Next, we need to subtract the 5 crayons Nori gave to Mae. 32 crayons - 5 crayons = 27 crayons We know that Nori has 15 crayons left, so we can subtract that from the 27 crayons to find out how many crayons she gave to Lea. 27 crayons - 15 crayons = 12 crayons Therefore, Nori gave 12 crayons to Lea. To find out how many more crayons Nori gave to Lea than Mae, we can subtract the 5 crayons from Mae from the 12 crayons given to Lea. 12 crayons - 5 crayons = 7 crayons So Nori gave 7 more crayons to Lea than Mae. The answer is 7.\n\n\n"
