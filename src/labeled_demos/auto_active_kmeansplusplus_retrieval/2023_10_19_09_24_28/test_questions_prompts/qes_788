  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Five people are planning a party. Sonja will buy a loaf of French bread ($3 a loaf) and a platter of cold cuts ($23). Barbara will buy the soda ($1 per person) and two boxes of crackers ($2 per box). Mario and Rick will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles ($3 per package). Danica will supply a package of paper plates for $4. How much more will Sonja spend than the rest of the office put together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of Barbara's contribution. She will buy soda for 5 people, which will cost $5 (1 dollar per person). She will also buy two boxes of crackers, which will cost $4 (2 dollars per box). Therefore, Barbara's total contribution will be $9. Next, let's calculate the total cost of Mario and Rick's contribution. They will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles, which will cost $6 in total (3 dollars per package). Now, let's add up the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's. Barbara's contribution is $9, Mario and Rick's contribution is $6, and Danica's contribution is $4. Therefore, the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's is $19. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of Sonja's contribution. She will buy a loaf of French bread for $3 and a platter of cold cuts for $23. Therefore, Sonja's total contribution will be $26. To find out how much more Sonja will spend than the rest of the office put together, we need to subtract the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's from Sonja's total contribution. $26 (Sonja's contribution) - $19 (total cost of everyone else's contribution) = $7 Therefore, Sonja will spend $7 more than the rest of the office put together. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: A department store offers a 10% discount for the amount exceeding $100 of the customer's total charge. Jaco bought a pair of shoes for $74; 2 pairs of socks that cost $2 per pair; a bag that costs $42. How much will Jaco pay for those items?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jaco bought: - Shoes: $74 - Socks: 2 pairs x $2 per pair = $4 - Bag: $42 Total cost = $74 + $4 + $42 = $120 Since the total cost exceeds $100, Jaco is eligible for a discount. The amount that exceeds $100 is $20 ($120 - $100). The discount is 10% of $20, which is $2. Therefore, Jaco will pay the total cost minus the discount: Total cost - discount = $120 - $2 = $118 Jaco will pay $118 for those items. The answer is 118.\n\n\nQ: It cost 50 dollars to get cats ready for adoption, 100 dollars to get adult dogs ready for adoption, and 150 to get puppies ready for adoption.  If 2 cats, 3 adult dogs, and 2 puppies are adopted what was the cost to get them ready?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of getting 2 cats ready for adoption, which is 2 x $50 = $100. Next, we need to calculate the cost of getting 3 adult dogs ready for adoption, which is 3 x $100 = $300. Finally, we need to calculate the cost of getting 2 puppies ready for adoption, which is 2 x $150 = $300. Therefore, the total cost to get all the animals ready for adoption is $100 + $300 + $300 = $700. The answer is 700.\n\n\nQ: Mr. Sean has a veterinary clinic where he charges clients $60 to treat a dog and $40 to care for a cat. If Khalil took 20 dogs and 60 cats to the clinic for treatment, how much money did he pay Mr. Sean?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of treating 20 dogs. 20 dogs x $60/dog = $1200 Next, we need to calculate the cost of caring for 60 cats. 60 cats x $40/cat = $2400 Finally, we add the cost of treating the dogs and caring for the cats to find the total cost. $1200 + $2400 = $3600 Therefore, Khalil paid Mr. Sean $3600 for treating 20 dogs and 60 cats. The answer is 60.\n\n\nQ: Tonya is buying Christmas gifts for her sisters. She has 2 sisters and wants to spend the exact same amount on each. She buys her younger sister 4 dolls that cost $15 each. She plans to buy lego sets for her older sister. They cost $20 each. How many lego sets does she buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much Tonya spent on dolls for her younger sister. She bought 4 dolls that cost $15 each, so she spent: 4 x $15 = $60 Since Tonya wants to spend the same amount on each sister, she needs to spend $60 on lego sets for her older sister as well. Each lego set costs $20, so she needs to buy: $60 \u00f7 $20 = 3 lego sets Therefore, Tonya needs to buy 3 lego sets for her older sister. The answer is 3.\n\n\nQ: Chad is hosting a BBQ on the hottest day of the year, where there will be a total of 15 people.  He will need 2 pounds of ice per person to account for the heat.  One pound bags of ice are sold for $3.00 for a pack of 10.  How much will he spend on ice?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pounds of ice Chad will need in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of people by the amount of ice needed per person: 15 people x 2 pounds/person = 30 pounds of ice Next, we need to figure out how many packs of ice Chad will need to buy. Since each pack contains 10 one-pound bags of ice, we can divide the total pounds needed by 10: 30 pounds of ice \u00f7 10 bags/pack = 3 packs of ice Finally, we can calculate the total cost of the ice by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack: 3 packs x $3.00/pack = $9.00 Therefore, Chad will spend $9.00 on ice for his BBQ. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: Marco has $24. Mary has $15. If Marco gives Mary half of what he has, Mary will have more than Marco. But Mary spends $5. How much more money does Mary have than Marco?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much money Marco gives to Mary. Since Marco has $24, half of that would be $12. So, Marco gives $12 to Mary. After receiving $12 from Marco, Mary will have $15 + $12 = $27. However, Mary spends $5, so we need to subtract that from her total. $27 - $5 = $22. Therefore, Mary has $22 more than Marco. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: A bag of dozen apples costs $14 and Brian has already spent $10 on kiwis and half that much on bananas. What's the maximum number of apples Brian can buy if he left his house with only $50 and needs to pay the $3.50 subway fare each way?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much money Brian has left after paying for the subway fare. He needs to pay $3.50 each way, so that's a total of $7 for the round trip. Therefore, he has $50 - $7 = $43 left to spend on groceries. Next, we need to figure out how much money Brian has already spent on bananas. We know he spent half as much on bananas as he did on kiwis, and he spent $10 on kiwis. So he spent $10 / 2 = $5 on bananas. Now we can subtract the amount Brian has already spent on kiwis and bananas from the total amount he has left to spend on groceries: $43 - $10 - $5 = $28. Finally, we need to figure out how many bags of apples Brian can buy with $28. We know that one bag of apples costs $14, so we can divide $28 by $14 to get the maximum number of bags of apples Brian can buy: $28 / $14 = 2. Therefore, the maximum number of bags of apples Brian can buy is 2. Since each bag contains a dozen apples, he can buy a total of 2 x 12 = 24 apples. The answer is 24.\n\n\n"
