  "formatted_prompt": "Q: 1 chocolate bar costs $1.50 and can be broken into 3 sections to make 3 s'mores.  Ron is hosting a boy scout camp out in his backyard for 15 scouts.  He wants to make sure that there are enough chocolate bars for everyone to have 2 s'mores each.  How much will he spend on chocolate bars?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how many s'mores Ron needs to make in total. Since there are 15 scouts and each scout needs 2 s'mores, Ron needs to make 15 x 2 = 30 s'mores in total. Next, we need to calculate how many chocolate bars Ron needs to buy. Since each chocolate bar can make 3 s'mores, Ron needs to buy 30/3 = 10 chocolate bars. Finally, we need to calculate how much Ron will spend on chocolate bars. Since each chocolate bar costs $1.50, Ron will spend 10 x $1.50 = $15 on chocolate bars. Therefore, Ron will spend $15 on chocolate bars to make sure that there are enough for everyone to have 2 s'mores each. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Ice cream costs $2.00 and toppings cost $0.50 per topping. How much does a sundae with 10 toppings cost?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the ice cream, which is $2.00. Next, we need to calculate the cost of the toppings. Since each topping costs $0.50 and there are 10 toppings, we can multiply $0.50 by 10 to get the total cost of the toppings: $0.50 x 10 = $5.00 Finally, we can add the cost of the ice cream and the toppings together to get the total cost of the sundae: $2.00 + $5.00 = $7.00 Therefore, a sundae with 10 toppings would cost $7.00. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: Chad is hosting a BBQ on the hottest day of the year, where there will be a total of 15 people.  He will need 2 pounds of ice per person to account for the heat.  One pound bags of ice are sold for $3.00 for a pack of 10.  How much will he spend on ice?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pounds of ice Chad will need in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of people by the amount of ice needed per person: 15 people x 2 pounds/person = 30 pounds of ice Next, we need to figure out how many packs of ice Chad will need to buy. Since each pack contains 10 one-pound bags of ice, we can divide the total pounds needed by 10: 30 pounds of ice \u00f7 10 bags/pack = 3 packs of ice Finally, we can calculate the total cost of the ice by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack: 3 packs x $3.00/pack = $9.00 Therefore, Chad will spend $9.00 on ice for his BBQ. The answer is 9.\n\n\nQ: A teacher has to order supplies for his class to do a science project. Each student needs a bow, a small bottle of vinegar and a box of baking soda. Bows are $5 each, a bottle of vinegar is $2 and a box of baking soda is $1. The teacher has 23 students in this class. How much will the supplies cost?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of the bows. Each student needs one bow, and each bow costs $5. So the total cost of bows for 23 students is: $5 x 23 = $115 Next, we need to calculate the cost of the vinegar. Each student needs one small bottle of vinegar, and each bottle costs $2. So the total cost of vinegar for 23 students is: $2 x 23 = $46 Finally, we need to calculate the cost of the baking soda. Each student needs one box of baking soda, and each box costs $1. So the total cost of baking soda for 23 students is: $1 x 23 = $23 To find the total cost of all the supplies, we just need to add up the costs of the bows, vinegar, and baking soda: $115 + $46 + $23 = $184 So the supplies will cost $184 in total. The answer is 184.\n\n\nQ: Five people are planning a party. Sonja will buy a loaf of French bread ($3 a loaf) and a platter of cold cuts ($23). Barbara will buy the soda ($1 per person) and two boxes of crackers ($2 per box). Mario and Rick will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles ($3 per package). Danica will supply a package of paper plates for $4. How much more will Sonja spend than the rest of the office put together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of Barbara's contribution. She will buy soda for 5 people, which will cost $5 (1 dollar per person). She will also buy two boxes of crackers, which will cost $4 (2 dollars per box). Therefore, Barbara's total contribution will be $9. Next, let's calculate the total cost of Mario and Rick's contribution. They will split the cost of two packages of Cheese Doodles, which will cost $6 in total (3 dollars per package). Now, let's add up the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's. Barbara's contribution is $9, Mario and Rick's contribution is $6, and Danica's contribution is $4. Therefore, the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's is $19. Finally, let's calculate the total cost of Sonja's contribution. She will buy a loaf of French bread for $3 and a platter of cold cuts for $23. Therefore, Sonja's total contribution will be $26. To find out how much more Sonja will spend than the rest of the office put together, we need to subtract the total cost of everyone's contribution except for Sonja's from Sonja's total contribution. $26 (Sonja's contribution) - $19 (total cost of everyone else's contribution) = $7 Therefore, Sonja will spend $7 more than the rest of the office put together. The answer is 7.\n\n\nQ: James buys pistachios for $10 per can.  Each can is 5 ounces.  He eats 30 ounces of pistachios every 5 days.  How much does he spend on pistachios per week?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many cans of pistachios James buys per week. Since he eats 30 ounces every 5 days, that means he eats 6 ounces per day (30 divided by 5). And since each can is 5 ounces, he needs to buy 1.2 cans per day (6 divided by 5). So, he needs to buy 8.4 cans per week (1.2 multiplied by 7). Next, we can calculate how much he spends on pistachios per week. Each can costs $10, so 8.4 cans will cost him $84 (8.4 multiplied by 10). Therefore, James spends $84 per week on pistachios. The answer is 84.\n\n\nQ: Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how much money Carl will earn in four weeks. If he earns $0.50 every time, and he buys a candy bar each time, that means he's spending $0.50 each week. But he's also earning $0.75 each week for taking out his neighbor's trash. So his net earnings each week are $0.75 - $0.50 = $0.25. Over four weeks, that's a total of $0.25 x 4 = $1. So Carl will have $1 to spend on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.50, he can buy 2 candy bars with his earnings. The answer is 2.\n\n\nQ: Brenda volunteered to make 3 trays of banana pudding for the family reunion.  Each tray of banana pudding would need 80 wafer cookies.  A box of wafer cookies only had 60 cookies per box.  Each box costs $3.50.  How much will it cost her to buy just enough boxes for 3 trays of banana pudding?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many wafer cookies Brenda needs in total. She needs 80 cookies per tray and she's making 3 trays, so she needs: 80 x 3 = 240 wafer cookies Next, we need to figure out how many boxes of cookies she needs to buy. Each box has 60 cookies, so we can divide the total number of cookies needed by the number of cookies per box: 240 \u00f7 60 = 4 boxes So Brenda needs to buy 4 boxes of cookies. Each box costs $3.50, so we can multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box: 4 x $3.50 = $14 Therefore, it will cost Brenda $14 to buy just enough boxes for 3 trays of banana pudding. The answer is 3.\n\n\n"
