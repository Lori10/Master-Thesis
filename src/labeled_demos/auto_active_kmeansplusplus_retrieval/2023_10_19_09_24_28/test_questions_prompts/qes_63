  "test_question": "Q: Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. Martha decided she needed more notebooks and then bought 5 more for a total of 7 notebooks. How many more than Joseph does she now have?",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Theresa has 5 more than thrice as many video games as Julia. Julia has a third as many video games as Tory. If Tory has 6 video games, how many video games does Theresa have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many video games Julia has. We know that Julia has a third as many video games as Tory, who has 6 video games. So, Julia has 6/3 = 2 video games. Next, we need to find out how many video games Theresa has. We know that Theresa has 5 more than thrice as many video games as Julia. So, we can write an equation: Theresa's video games = 5 + 3 * Julia's video games Substituting Julia's video games with 2, we get: Theresa's video games = 5 + 3 * 2 Theresa's video games = 11 Therefore, Theresa has 11 video games. The answer is 11.\n\n\nQ: Bart buys $10 of notepads for $1.25 each.  They have 60 pages each.  How many pages did he buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many notepads Bart bought. We can do this by dividing the total amount he spent by the cost of each notepad: $10 \u00f7 $1.25 = 8 notepads Next, we need to find out how many pages are in each notepad and multiply that by the number of notepads: 60 pages/notepad x 8 notepads = 480 pages Therefore, Bart bought 480 pages of notepads. The answer is 480.\n\n\nQ: Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. If Mabel has 85 marbles, how many more marbles does Mabel have than Amanda?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Katrina has. We know that Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 85 marbles, so we can set up an equation: Mabel's marbles = 5 x Katrina's marbles 85 = 5 x Katrina's marbles Katrina's marbles = 17 Now we know that Katrina has 17 marbles. We also know that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. So we can set up another equation: Amanda's marbles = 2 x Katrina's marbles + 12 Amanda's marbles = 2 x 17 + 12 Amanda's marbles = 46 So Amanda has 46 marbles. Finally, we can figure out how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda: Mabel's marbles - Amanda's marbles = 85 - 46 Mabel's marbles - Amanda's marbles = 39 Therefore, Mabel has 39 more marbles than Amanda. The answer is 39.\n\n\nQ: Sally, Sam, and Steve went to play with their marbles. In the beginning, Sam has twice as many marbles as Steve while Sally has 5 less than Sam. After Sam has given Sally and Steve 3 marbles each, Sam has 8 marbles left. How many marbles does Steve have now?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Sam had in the beginning. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve, so let's call the number of marbles Steve had \"x\". This means that Sam had 2x marbles. Next, we know that Sally had 5 less marbles than Sam, so Sally had 2x - 5 marbles. After Sam gave 3 marbles each to Sally and Steve, he was left with 8 marbles. This means that he gave away a total of 6 marbles (3 to Sally and 3 to Steve), so he must have started with 14 marbles (8 + 6 = 14). Now we can use this information to figure out how many marbles Steve has. We know that Sam had twice as many marbles as Steve in the beginning, so if Sam had 14 marbles, Steve must have had 7 marbles (14 \u00f7 2 = 7). After Sam gave Steve 3 marbles, Steve now has 10 marbles (7 + 3 = 10). The answer is 10.\n\n\nQ: Betty has 20 books, and her sister has 1/4 times more books than Betty. What's the total number of books the two have?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many books Betty's sister has. To do this, we can take 1/4 of Betty's number of books and add it to Betty's number of books. 1/4 of 20 books is (1/4) x 20 = 5 books. So Betty's sister has 20 + 5 = 25 books. To find the total number of books the two have, we can add Betty's number of books to her sister's number of books: 20 + 25 = 45 books. Therefore, the two sisters have a total of 45 books. The answer is 45.\n\n\nQ: Marco has $24. Mary has $15. If Marco gives Mary half of what he has, Mary will have more than Marco. But Mary spends $5. How much more money does Mary have than Marco?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how much money Marco gives to Mary. Since Marco has $24, half of that would be $12. So, Marco gives $12 to Mary. After receiving $12 from Marco, Mary will have $15 + $12 = $27. However, Mary spends $5, so we need to subtract that from her total. $27 - $5 = $22. Therefore, Mary has $22 more than Marco. The answer is 22.\n\n\nQ: Mary and her two friends came up with the idea of collecting marbles each day for their play on weekends. From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red marbles Mary collected. We know that Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles. Next, we need to find out how many blue marbles Anie collected. We know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, which is 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles. We also know that Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Finally, we need to find out how many blue marbles the friends collected together. Mary collected 25 blue marbles, Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, and Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 blue marbles. The answer is 100.\n\n\nQ: Miriam currently has 30 marbles, but she used to have more. Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, gave her sister twice that amount and gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has. How many marbles did Miriam start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, so she now has 30 - 60 = -30 marbles. This doesn't make sense, so we know that Miriam must have started with more than 60 marbles. Next, we know that Miriam gave her sister twice the amount she gave her brother, so her sister received 2 * 60 = 120 marbles. We also know that Miriam gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has, so Savanna received 3 * 30 = 90 marbles. In total, Miriam gave away 60 + 120 + 90 = 270 marbles. If Miriam started with x marbles, we can set up the equation: x - 270 = 30 Solving for x, we get: x = 300 Therefore, Miriam started with 300 marbles. The answer is 300.\n\n\n"
