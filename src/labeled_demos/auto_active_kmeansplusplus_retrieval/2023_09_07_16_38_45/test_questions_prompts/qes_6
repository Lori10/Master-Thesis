The waste pipe can empty the full cistern in? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 6 (C) 7 (D) 9 (E) 1\nA: Let's think step by step. 1/10 + 1/15 - 1/x = 1/18 x = 9 Answer: D The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: One fill pipe A is 3 times faster than second fill pipe B and takes 10 minutes less time to fill a cistern than B takes. Find when the cistern will be full if fill pipe B is only opened. Answer Choices: (A) 20 min (B) 18 min (C) 15 min (D) 10 min (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Let B can fill the cistern in x min. Then, then A can fill the cistern in x\u20443 min Given x - x\u20443 = 10 \u21d2 x = 15 min Answer C The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Rahul can do a work in 3 days while Rajesh can do the same work in 2days.
