When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places there 6 children between Radha and Neha. How many children are there in the row? Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In how many ways can 5 boys and 3 girls be seated on 8 chairs so that no two girls are together? Answer Choices: (A) A) 5760 (B) B) 14400 (C) C) 480 (D) D) 56 (E) E) 40320\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We can seat the 5 boys in 5! ways. Step 2: We can create 4 gaps between the boys where the girls can be seated. For example, if the boys are seated as B1 B2 B3 B4 B5, the gaps are _B1_, B1_B2_, B2_B3_, B3_B4_, _B4_, where _ represents an empty chair. The girls can be seated in any 3 of these gaps in 3! ways. Step 3: We can seat the 3 girls in the chosen gaps in 3! ways. Therefore, the total number of ways to seat the boys and girls is 5! x 4 x 3! x 3! = 14,400. The answer is (B) 14,400. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: The division of a whole number N by 13 gives a quotient of 34 and a remainder of 2. Find N. Answer Choices: (A) 797 (B) 197 (C) 597 (D) 412 (E) 444\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that N divided by 13 gives a quotient of 34 and a remainder of 2. This can be written as: N = 13 x 34 + 2 N = 442 + 2 N = 444 Therefore, the answer is (E) 444. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: 12+6=792\n10+2=110\n1+9=9\n2+7=16\n11+4=??\nSolve it? Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 190 (D) 160 (E) 154\nA: Let's think step by step. In the first equation, 12+6=18. In the second equation, 10+2=12. In the third equation, 1+9=10. In the fourth equation, 2+7=9. To solve the fifth equation, we need to find a pattern in the given equations. We can see that the sum of the two numbers in each equation is multiplied by the second number to get the answer. For example, in the first equation, (12+6) x 6 = 108, which is the answer. Using the same pattern, we can solve the fifth equation: (11+4) x 4 = 60. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: 5 persons A,B,C,D and E occupy seats in a row at random. What is the probability that A and B sit next to each other ? Answer Choices: (A) 3/5 (B) 2/5 (C) 1/5 (D) 8/5 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 5 people, so there are 5! = 120 ways to arrange them in a row. Now, let's consider A and B as a single entity, AB. Then, there are 4! = 24 ways to arrange the entities AB, C, D, and E in a row. However, within the entity AB, there are 2! = 2 ways to arrange A and B. So, there are 2 x 4! = 48 ways for A and B to sit next to each other. Therefore, the probability of A and B sitting next to each other is 48/120 = 2/5. The correct answer is (B) 2/5. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
