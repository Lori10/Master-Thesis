  "test_question": "Q: The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000 and the sum of the numbers is 1000. The numbers are Answer Choices: (A) 600, 400 (B) 628, 372 (C) 640, 360 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The mean of (54,824)^2 and (54,826)^2 = Answer Choices: (A) (54,821) ^2 (B) (54,821.5) ^2 (C) (54,820.5) ^2 (D) (54,825) ^2 + 1 (E) (54,821) ^2 \u2013 1\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the square of 54,824 and 54,826. 54,824^2 = 2,999,998,976 54,826^2 = 3,000,005,476 Next, we need to find the mean of these two numbers. Mean = (2,999,998,976 + 3,000,005,476) / 2 Mean = 2,999,999,226 Now, we need to find the square of this mean. Mean^2 = (2,999,999,226)^2 Mean^2 = 8,999,997,999,520,676 Therefore, the answer is (A) (54,821)^2. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: How many 4-digit Q numbers (ABCD) can be formed such that |A \u2013 D| = 2? Answer Choices: (A) 2,000 (B) 1,900 (C) 1,800 (D) 1,600 (E) 1,500\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that |A \u2013 D| = 2. This means that A and D are either 2 digits apart or 2 digits away from each other in the number line. Case 1: A is 2 digits greater than D. In this case, we can choose any digit from 1 to 9 for D (since it's a 4-digit number, we can't have 0 as the first digit). Then, A can be any digit that is 2 greater than D, except for 9 (since we can't have a 5th digit). So, there are 8 choices for A. Case 2: D is 2 digits greater than A. This is the same as Case 1, but with A and D switched. So, there are also 8 choices for A in this case. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit Q numbers that can be formed is 8 + 8 = 16. The answer is (D) 1,600. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: 9, 16, 20, 25, 36,49 Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 16 (C) 20 (D) 25 (E) 36\nA: Let's think step by step. The given sequence of numbers is 9, 16, 20, 25, 36, 49. We need to find a pattern or rule that relates these numbers. Looking at the sequence, we can see that each number is a perfect square except for 20. 9 = 3^2 16 = 4^2 20 is not a perfect square 25 = 5^2 36 = 6^2 49 = 7^2 Therefore, the answer is (C) 20. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If 9210 - 9124 = 210-square, the value represented by the square is Answer Choices: (A) 296 (B) 210 (C) 186 (D) 124 (E) 24\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the difference between 9210 and 9124: 9210 - 9124 = 86 Next, we know that 210 is equal to the square of a number, so we need to find that number. We can do this by taking the square root of 210: sqrt(210) \u2248 14.49 However, we need to find the value represented by the square, not the square root. To do this, we need to square 14.49: 14.49^2 \u2248 210.02 So the value represented by the square is approximately 210.02, which is closest to answer choice (B) 210. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
