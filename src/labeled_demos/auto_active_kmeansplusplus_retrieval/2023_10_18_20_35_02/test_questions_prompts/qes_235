  "test_question": "Q: A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Two stations A and B are 110 km apart on a straight line. One train starts from A at 7 a.m. and travels towards B at 20 kmph. Another train starts from B at 8 a.m. and travels towards A at a speed of 25 kmph. At what time will they meet? Answer Choices: (A) 39 (B) 10 (C) 88 (D) 12 (E) 18\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much distance the first train covers before the second train starts. The first train starts at 7 a.m. and the second train starts at 8 a.m., which means the first train has a one-hour head start. In one hour, the first train covers a distance of 20 km. Now, let's assume that the two trains meet after t hours. In that case, the second train would have traveled for t - 1 hours. Let's use the formula: distance = speed x time Distance covered by the first train + Distance covered by the second train = Total distance between the two stations 20t + 25(t-1) = 110 Simplifying the equation, we get: 45t = 135 t = 3 Therefore, the two trains will meet after 3 hours. The first train started at 7 a.m., so it will meet the second train at 10 a.m. Hence, the correct answer is (B) 10. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A man complete a journey in 10 hours. He travels first half of the journey at the rate of 20 km/hr and second half at the rate of 20 km/hr. Find the total journey in km. Answer Choices: (A) 220 km (B) 224 km (C) 230 km (D) 232 km (E) 200 km\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the total distance be 'd' km. The man travels the first half of the journey at a speed of 20 km/hr. Therefore, he covers the first half of the distance in d/2 * 20 = 10d/2 = 5d hours. Similarly, he covers the second half of the journey at a speed of 20 km/hr. Therefore, he covers the second half of the distance in d/2 * 20 = 10d/2 = 5d hours. Since the total time taken for the journey is 10 hours, we can write the equation: 5d/20 + 5d/20 = 10 Simplifying this equation, we get: d = 200 km Therefore, the total journey is 200 km. Hence, the correct answer is (E) 200 km. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: The speed of a train is 94 kmph. What is the distance covered by it in 12 minutes? Answer Choices: (A) 15 kmph (B) 11 kmph (C) 88 kmph (D) 19 kmph (E) 12 kmph\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that the speed of the train is 94 kmph. To find the distance covered in 12 minutes, we need to convert 12 minutes to hours. 1 hour = 60 minutes So, 12 minutes = 12/60 = 0.2 hours Now, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time Distance = 94 kmph x 0.2 hours Distance = 18.8 km Therefore, the distance covered by the train in 12 minutes is 18.8 km. The answer is not listed in the options. None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Two goods trains each 1250 m long are running in opposite directions on parallel tracks. Their speeds are 45 km/hr and 30 km/hr respectively. Find the time taken by the slower train to pass the driver of the faster one? Answer Choices: (A) 228 (B) 278 (C) 48 (D) 27 (E) 120\nA: Let's think step by step. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds, which is 45 + 30 = 75 km/hr. We need to convert this to meters per second, so we divide by 3.6: 75 km/hr \u00f7 3.6 = 20.83 m/s Now we can find the time taken by the slower train to pass the driver of the faster one. The total distance that the slower train needs to cover is the sum of the lengths of the two trains, which is 2 \u00d7 1250 = 2500 m. Using the formula distance = speed \u00d7 time, we can find the time taken: time = distance \u00f7 speed time = 2500 m \u00f7 20.83 m/s time \u2248 120 seconds Therefore, the answer is (E) 120. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
