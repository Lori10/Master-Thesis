  "test_question": "Q: Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If John takes 4 minutes to eat x raisins, how many seconds will it take him to eat z raisins, assuming he continues to eat at the same rate? Answer Choices: (A) 240z/x (B) 4xz (C) 240x/z (D) 240xz (E) 4z/x\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many raisins John can eat in one minute. We can do this by dividing x by 4 (since he eats x raisins in 4 minutes): x/4 Now we need to find out how many seconds it will take him to eat z raisins. We can set up a proportion: x/4 = z/t where t is the time it takes him to eat z raisins in seconds. We can solve for t: t = 4z/x Therefore, the answer is (E) 4z/x. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: One fill pipe A is 3 times faster than second fill pipe B and takes 10 minutes less time to fill a cistern than B takes. Find when the cistern will be full if fill pipe B is only opened. Answer Choices: (A) 20 min (B) 18 min (C) 15 min (D) 10 min (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the time taken by fill pipe B to fill the cistern is x minutes. According to the problem, fill pipe A is 3 times faster than fill pipe B. Therefore, the time taken by fill pipe A to fill the cistern will be x/3 minutes. Also, it is given that fill pipe A takes 10 minutes less time than fill pipe B to fill the cistern. Therefore, we can write the equation: x - 10 = x/3 Solving this equation, we get: 2x/3 = 10 x = 15 Therefore, fill pipe B takes 15 minutes to fill the cistern. Hence, the answer is (C) 15 min. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Two taps can separately fill a cistern 10 minutes and 15 minutes respectively and when the waste pipe is open, they can together fill it in 18 minutes. The waste pipe can empty the full cistern in? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 6 (C) 7 (D) 9 (E) 1\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the capacity of the cistern be C. The rate of filling of the first tap is C/10 per minute. The rate of filling of the second tap is C/15 per minute. When both taps are open, their combined rate of filling is C/18 per minute. Let the rate of emptying of the waste pipe be W (in terms of the capacity of the cistern per minute). According to the problem, when all three are open, the net rate of filling is zero (since the waste pipe is emptying the cistern at the same time). So, we can write the equation: C/10 + C/15 - C/18 = W Multiplying through by the LCM of the denominators (which is 90), we get: 9C + 6C - 5C = 90W Simplifying, we get: 10C = 90W Dividing by 10, we get: C = 9W This means that the waste pipe can empty the full cistern in 9 minutes (since it empties 1/9th of the cistern per minute). Therefore, the answer is (D) 9. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A fort had provision of food for 150 men for 60 days. After 10 days, 25 men left the fort. The number of days for which the remaining food will last, is: Answer Choices: (A) 29 1/5 (B) 37 1/4 (C) 42 (D) 54 (E) 60\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total amount of food available in the fort. The provision of food for 150 men for 60 days means that the fort has food for 150 x 60 = 9000 man-days. Step 2: Find the amount of food consumed in the first 10 days. Since there were 150 men in the fort for the first 10 days, the amount of food consumed in the first 10 days is 150 x 10 = 1500 man-days. Step 3: Find the amount of food remaining after 10 days. The amount of food remaining after 10 days is 9000 - 1500 = 7500 man-days. Step 4: Find the number of men remaining in the fort. After 25 men left the fort, the number of men remaining in the fort is 150 - 25 = 125. Step 5: Find the number of days for which the remaining food will last. Let's assume that the remaining food will last for x days. Since the same amount of food is now available for 125 men, the amount of food required for x days is 125x man-days. We know that this amount of food is equal to the remaining food in the fort, which is 7500 man-days. Therefore, we can write the equation: 125x = 7500 Solving for x, we get: x = 60 Therefore, the remaining food will last for 60 days. Answer: (E) 60 The answer is E.\n\n\n"
