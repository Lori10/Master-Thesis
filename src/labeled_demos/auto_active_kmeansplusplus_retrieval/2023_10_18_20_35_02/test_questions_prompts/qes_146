  "test_question": "Q: I know a 5 digit number having a property that with a 1 after it, it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it.\nWhat is that number? Answer Choices: (A) 42857 (B) 32456 (C) 76523 (D) 24567 (E) 43566",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Find a 8 digit number that if multiplied by the number 9 or any of its multiplications products (18, 27, 36, 45,..) will result in the multiplication factor repeated (n) number of times. Answer Choices: (A) 12435687 (B) 12345679 (C) 10000000 (D) 99999999 (E) 11111111\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find a number that has 8 digits. Let's start with the number 12345678. Next, we need to check if this number satisfies the given condition. If we multiply it by 9, we get 111111102. This doesn't satisfy the condition because the multiplication factor (1) is not repeated any number of times. Let's try the next number, 12345679. If we multiply it by 9, we get 111111111. This satisfies the condition because the multiplication factor (1) is repeated 8 times. Therefore, the answer is (B) 12345679. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: How many 4-digit Q numbers (ABCD) can be formed such that |A \u2013 D| = 2? Answer Choices: (A) 2,000 (B) 1,900 (C) 1,800 (D) 1,600 (E) 1,500\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that |A \u2013 D| = 2. This means that A and D are either 2 digits apart or 2 digits away from each other in the number line. Case 1: A is 2 digits greater than D. In this case, we can choose any digit from 1 to 9 for D (since it's a 4-digit number, we can't have 0 as the first digit). Then, A can be any digit that is 2 greater than D, except for 9 (since we can't have a 5th digit). So, there are 8 choices for A. Case 2: D is 2 digits greater than A. This is the same as Case 1, but with A and D switched. So, there are also 8 choices for A in this case. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit Q numbers that can be formed is 8 + 8 = 16. The answer is (D) 1,600. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If you add all the numbers on your mobile phone except 9, what is the answer? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 28 (C) 65 (D) 36 (E) 42\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to identify all the numbers on a mobile phone except 9. These are the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Next, we need to add all these digits together. 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36 Therefore, the answer is (D) 36. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: How many three-digit whole numbers yield a remainder of 1 when divided by 10 and also yield a remainder of 1 when divided by 6? Answer Choices: (A) None (B) One (C) Two (D) Three (E) Four\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 10. These numbers are of the form 10a + 1, where a is an integer. Next, we need to find the numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 6. These numbers are of the form 6b + 1, where b is an integer. To find the numbers that satisfy both conditions, we need to find the values of a and b that make 10a + 1 and 6b + 1 equal. 10a + 1 = 6b + 1 Simplifying, we get: 10a = 6b Dividing both sides by 2, we get: 5a = 3b This means that a must be a multiple of 3 and b must be a multiple of 5. The smallest three-digit number that satisfies both conditions is 121 (10*12+1). The next number is 181 (10*18+1). Therefore, the answer is (C) Two. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
