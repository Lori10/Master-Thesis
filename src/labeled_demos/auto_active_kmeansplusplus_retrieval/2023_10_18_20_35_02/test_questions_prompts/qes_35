  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Find the sum The difference between the compound and S.I. on a certain sum of money for 5 years at 20% per annum is Rs.75 of money? Answer Choices: (A) 1489 (B) 6845 (C) 2598 (D) 1875 (E) 2600\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the principal be P. Compound Interest (CI) for 5 years at 20% per annum = P(1 + 20/100)^5 - P = P(1.20)^5 - P Simple Interest (SI) for 5 years at 20% per annum = P x 20/100 x 5 = P Difference between CI and SI = P(1.20)^5 - P - P = P[(1.20)^5 - 2] Given that this difference is Rs. 75. Therefore, P[(1.20)^5 - 2] = 75 P = 75 / [(1.20)^5 - 2] Now, we need to find the sum of the difference between CI and SI for 5 years at 20% per annum. Sum = 5P[(1.20)^5 - 2] = 5 x 75 = 375 Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the calculated sum. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A certain amount earns simple interest of Rs. 1750 after 7 years. Had the interest been 2% more, how much more interest would it have earned? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 35 (B) Rs. 245 (C) Rs. 350 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Given, the amount earns simple interest of Rs. 1750 after 7 years. Let the principal amount be P and the rate of interest be R. Simple Interest formula is given by: S.I. = (P * R * T) / 100 Here, S.I. = Rs. 1750, T = 7 years So, 1750 = (P * R * 7) / 100 => PR = 25000 Now, if the interest rate is increased by 2%, the new rate of interest will be R + 2. New S.I. = (P * (R + 2) * T) / 100 New S.I. - Old S.I. = [(P * (R + 2) * T) / 100] - [(P * R * T) / 100] = (P * 2 * T) / 100 = (P * 2 * 7) / 100 = (14P / 100) = 0.14P We don't know the value of P, so we cannot determine the exact amount of increased interest. Therefore, the answer is (D) Cannot be determined. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: An amount of Rs. 3000 becomes Rs. 3600 in four years at simple interest. If the rate of interest was 1% more, then what was be the total amount? Answer Choices: (A) 3728 (B) 3726 (C) 3720 (D) 3722 (E) 3721\nA: Let's think step by step. Given, Principal (P) = Rs. 3000, Time (t) = 4 years, Simple Interest (SI) = Rs. 3600 - Rs. 3000 = Rs. 600. Using the formula for simple interest, we can find the rate of interest (R): SI = (P * R * t) / 100 600 = (3000 * R * 4) / 100 R = 5% Now, if the rate of interest is 1% more, then the new rate of interest (R') would be: R' = R + 1% = 5 + 0.01 = 0.06 Using the same formula for simple interest, we can find the new amount (A): A = P + SI A = 3000 + (3000 * 0.06 * 4) / 100 A = Rs. 3720 Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 3720. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: At what rate percent of simple interest will a sum of money double itself in 22 years? Answer Choices: (A) 6.54 % (B) 4.54 % (C) 8 .2 % (D) 4.94 % (E) 5.54 %\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the formula for simple interest: Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100 Let P be the principal amount and r be the rate of interest. We know that the principal amount will double in 22 years. So, 2P = P + (P * r * 22) / 100 Simplifying this equation, we get: P * r * 22 = P r = 1/22 = 0.0454 Therefore, the rate of interest is 4.54%. The correct answer is (B) 4.54%. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
