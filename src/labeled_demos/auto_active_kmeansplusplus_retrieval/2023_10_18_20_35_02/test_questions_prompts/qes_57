  "test_question": "Q: What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729. Answer Choices: (A) 37 (B) 38 (C) 36 (D) 30 (E) 39",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: what is the smallest number should be added to 5377 so that the sum is completely divisible by 7? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 4 (C) 6 (D) 2 (E) 1\nA: Let's think step by step. To make a number completely divisible by 7, we need to add the smallest number that will make the sum a multiple of 7. We can find this number by taking the remainder of the original number when divided by 7 and subtracting it from 7. So, let's find the remainder of 5377 when divided by 7: 5377 \u00f7 7 = 768 R 1 So, the remainder is 1. To make the sum completely divisible by 7, we need to add: 7 - 1 = 6 Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 6. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Find a 8 digit number that if multiplied by the number 9 or any of its multiplications products (18, 27, 36, 45,..) will result in the multiplication factor repeated (n) number of times. Answer Choices: (A) 12435687 (B) 12345679 (C) 10000000 (D) 99999999 (E) 11111111\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find a number that has 8 digits. Let's start with the number 12345678. Next, we need to check if this number satisfies the given condition. If we multiply it by 9, we get 111111102. This doesn't satisfy the condition because the multiplication factor (1) is not repeated any number of times. Let's try the next number, 12345679. If we multiply it by 9, we get 111111111. This satisfies the condition because the multiplication factor (1) is repeated 8 times. Therefore, the answer is (B) 12345679. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If you add all the numbers on your mobile phone except 9, what is the answer? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 28 (C) 65 (D) 36 (E) 42\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to identify all the numbers on a mobile phone except 9. These are the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Next, we need to add all these digits together. 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36 Therefore, the answer is (D) 36. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If the sum of five consecutive positive integers is A, then the sum of the next three consecutive integers in terms of A is: Answer Choices: (A) 3A/5 (B) 3A/5 +12 (C) A (D) 5A/3 (E) 5A/3 +12\nA: Let's think step by step. The sum of five consecutive positive integers can be expressed as: x + (x+1) + (x+2) + (x+3) + (x+4) = 5x + 10 = A Now, we need to find the sum of the next three consecutive integers. Let's call the first of these three integers y. Then, the sum of the three consecutive integers can be expressed as: y + (y+1) + (y+2) = 3y + 3 We want to express this sum in terms of A. We can use the fact that the sum of the first five consecutive integers is equal to A: 5x + 10 = A We can solve for x: 5x = A - 10 x = (A-10)/5 Now, we can substitute this expression for x into the expression for the sum of the three consecutive integers: 3y + 3 = 3((A-10)/5 + 1) + 3 = 3A/5 + 3 Therefore, the answer is (B) 3A/5 + 12. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
