  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A certain amount earns simple interest of Rs. 1750 after 7 years. Had the interest been 2% more, how much more interest would it have earned? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 35 (B) Rs. 245 (C) Rs. 350 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Given, the amount earns simple interest of Rs. 1750 after 7 years. Let the principal amount be P and the rate of interest be R. Simple Interest formula is given by: S.I. = (P * R * T) / 100 Here, S.I. = Rs. 1750, T = 7 years So, 1750 = (P * R * 7) / 100 => PR = 25000 Now, if the interest rate is increased by 2%, the new rate of interest will be R + 2. New S.I. = (P * (R + 2) * T) / 100 New S.I. - Old S.I. = [(P * (R + 2) * T) / 100] - [(P * R * T) / 100] = (P * 2 * T) / 100 = (P * 2 * 7) / 100 = (14P / 100) = 0.14P We don't know the value of P, so we cannot determine the exact amount of increased interest. Therefore, the answer is (D) Cannot be determined. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Reena took a loan of Rs. 1200 with simple interest for as many years as the rate of interest. If she paid Rs. 588 as interest at the end of the loan period, what was the rate of interest? Answer Choices: (A) 3.6 (B) 7 (C) 18 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve the problem step by step. Let the rate of interest be x% per year. Then, the time period will also be x years. Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100 Given, Principal = Rs. 1200 and Simple Interest = Rs. 588 Therefore, 588 = (1200 * x * x) / 100 Simplifying the above equation, we get: x^2 = 49 Taking the square root on both sides, we get: x = 7 Hence, the rate of interest is 7% per year. Therefore, the correct answer is option (B) 7. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: An amount of Rs. 3000 becomes Rs. 3600 in four years at simple interest. If the rate of interest was 1% more, then what was be the total amount? Answer Choices: (A) 3728 (B) 3726 (C) 3720 (D) 3722 (E) 3721\nA: Let's think step by step. Given, Principal (P) = Rs. 3000, Time (t) = 4 years, Simple Interest (SI) = Rs. 3600 - Rs. 3000 = Rs. 600. Using the formula for simple interest, we can find the rate of interest (R): SI = (P * R * t) / 100 600 = (3000 * R * 4) / 100 R = 5% Now, if the rate of interest is 1% more, then the new rate of interest (R') would be: R' = R + 1% = 5 + 0.01 = 0.06 Using the same formula for simple interest, we can find the new amount (A): A = P + SI A = 3000 + (3000 * 0.06 * 4) / 100 A = Rs. 3720 Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 3720. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: How much time will it take for an amount of Rs. 450 to yield Rs. 81 as interest at 4.5 % per annum of simple interest ? Answer Choices: (A) 3.5 years (B) 4 years (C) 4.5 years (D) 5 years (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that Simple Interest (SI) = (P * R * T) / 100, where P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest and T is the time period. Here, P = Rs. 450, SI = Rs. 81 and R = 4.5% Substituting the values in the formula, we get: 81 = (450 * 4.5 * T) / 100 Simplifying this equation, we get: T = (81 * 100) / (450 * 4.5) T = 4 years Therefore, the answer is (B) 4 years. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
