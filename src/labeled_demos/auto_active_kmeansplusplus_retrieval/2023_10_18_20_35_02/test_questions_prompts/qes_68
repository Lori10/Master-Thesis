  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Bill\u2019s compact disc player randomly plays a song, so that no song is repeated before the entire album is played. If Bill plays a disc with 12 songs, what are the chances that the third song he hears will be his favorite? Answer Choices: (A) 1/12 (B) 1/13 (C) 1/11 (D) 3/14 (E) 1/3\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 12 songs on the disc, so the probability of any one song being played third is 1/12. However, we are looking for the probability that Bill's favorite song is played third. Since the songs are played randomly, there are 12 possible songs that could be played first, 11 possible songs that could be played second (since one song has already been played), and 10 possible songs that could be played third (since two songs have already been played). Therefore, the probability of Bill's favorite song being played third is: 1/12 (probability of it being the third song) x 1/11 (probability of it being one of the remaining songs on the second play) x 1/10 (probability of it being one of the remaining songs on the third play) = 1/132 So the answer is (B) 1/13. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A student must answer 7 out of 10 questions on an examination. If at least 3 of the first 5 questions must be answered, how many possible combinations of 7 questions are available to the student?\n. Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 80 (C) 110 (D) 220 (E) 360\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that the student must answer 7 out of 10 questions, so we need to find the number of ways to choose 7 questions out of 10. This can be calculated using the combination formula: 10C7 = 10! / (7! * 3!) = 120 So there are 120 possible combinations of 7 questions. Step 2: We also know that at least 3 of the first 5 questions must be answered. This means that the student can either answer 3, 4, or 5 questions from the first 5. Step 3: We need to find the number of ways to choose the remaining questions from the remaining 5. This can be calculated using the combination formula: 5C4 + 5C3 + 5C2 = 5! / (4! * 1!) + 5! / (3! * 2!) + 5! / (2! * 3!) = 5 + 10 + 10 = 25 So there are 25 ways to choose the remaining questions. Step 4: We can now find the total number of possible combinations by multiplying the results from step 2 and step 3: (3C3 * 5C4) + (4C3 * 5C3) + (5C3 * 5C2) = (1 * 5) + (4 * 10) + (10 * 10) = 5 + 40 + 100 = 145 Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the correct answer of 145. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Six students are equally divided into 3 groups, then, the three groups were assigned to three different topics. How many different arrangements Q are possible? Answer Choices: (A)  30 (B)  60 (C)  90 (D)  180 (E)  540\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We need to find the number of ways to divide 6 students equally into 3 groups. This can be done using combinations. We need to choose 2 students from 6 for the first group, then 2 students from the remaining 4 for the second group, and the remaining 2 students will be in the third group. The number of ways to choose 2 students from 6 is 6C2 = 15. The number of ways to choose 2 students from 4 is 4C2 = 6. So the total number of ways to divide 6 students equally into 3 groups is 15 x 6 = 90. Step 2: We need to find the number of ways to assign the 3 groups to 3 different topics. This can be done in 3! = 6 ways. Step 3: We need to find the total number of arrangements Q by multiplying the results of step 1 and step 2. Q = 90 x 6 = 540. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 540. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In a class of 25 students in an examination in maths 3 students scored 95 marks each, 5 get zero each and the average of the rest was 45. What is the average of the whole class? Answer Choices: (A) A) 47 (B) B) 45.6 (C) C) 42 (D) D) 48 (E) E) 49\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total marks obtained by the class. Total marks obtained by the class = (3 students * 95 marks each) + (5 students * 0 marks each) + (17 students * 45 marks each) = 285 + 0 + 765 = 1050 Now, we can find the average of the whole class by dividing the total marks obtained by the number of students. Average of the whole class = Total marks obtained by the class / Number of students = 1050 / 25 = 42 Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 42. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
