  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Mohit sold an article for Rs. 18000. Had he offered a discount of 10% on the selling price, he would have earned a profit of 8%. What is the cost price of the article? Answer Choices: (A) 15000 (B) 15002 (C) 26879 (D) 26992 (E) 12681\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the cost price of the article be x. If Mohit had offered a discount of 10%, the selling price would have been 90% of the original selling price, which is 0.9 * 18000 = 16200. If he had earned a profit of 8%, the cost price would have been (16200/1.08) = 15000. Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 15000. The correct answer is (A) 15000.

Answer Choices: (A) 150 (B) 160 (C) 170 (D) 180 (E) 240\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the cost price of the article be x. According to the question, he sells the article at a gain of 15%, so the selling price would be 1.15x. Now, if he had bought it at 10% less, the cost price would be 0.9x. And if he had sold it for 6 less, the selling price would be 1.15x - 6. According to the question, if he had done this, he would have gained 25%. So, we can write: 1.15x - (1.15x - 6) = 0.25(0.9x) Simplifying this equation, we get: 6 = 0.025x x = 240 Therefore, the cost price of the article is 240. The correct answer is (E) 240. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: If on an item a company gives 25% discount, they earn 25% profit.If they now give 10% discount then what is the profit? Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 40 (C) 50 (D) 60 (E) 70\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the original price of the item is $100. With a 25% discount, the selling price becomes 75% of the original price, which is $75. Now, we know that the company earns a 25% profit on this selling price of $75. Profit = 25% of $75 = $18.75 So, the cost price of the item for the company is $75 - $18.75 = $56.25 If the company now gives a 10% discount, the selling price becomes 90% of $75, which is $67.50. The cost price for the company remains the same at $56.25. Profit = Selling price - Cost price = $67.50 - $56.25 = $11.25 Therefore, the profit is $11.25. The correct answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the calculated profit. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Gautami went to the stationers and bought things worth Rs. 100, out of which 50 paise went on sales tax on taxable purchases. If the tax rate was 5%. then what was the cost of the tax free items? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 99.50 (B) Rs. 70.50 (C) Rs. 89.50 (D) Rs. 69.50 (E) Rs. 80.50\nA: Let's think step by step. The total cost of the items including tax is Rs. 100. Out of this, 50 paise (or Rs. 0.50) went on sales tax. We know that the tax rate is 5%. So, we can set up an equation: 5% of the taxable purchases = Rs. 0.50 To find the cost of tax-free items, we need to subtract the tax amount from the total cost: Cost of tax-free items = Total cost - Tax amount Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 100 - Rs. 0.50 Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 99.50 Therefore, the answer is (A) Rs. 99.50. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
