If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 50% (D) 65% (E) 75%",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: At a contest with 2,500 participants, 1/2 of the people are aged 10 to 12. Next year, the number of people aged 10 to 12 will increase by 1/5. After this change, what percentage of the total 2,500 people will the 10- to 12-year-olds represent? Answer Choices: (A) 55% (B) 60% (C) 50% (D) 45% (E) 66%\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 at the contest. 1/2 of 2,500 = 1,250 people aged 10 to 12. Step 2: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1/5 of 1,250 = 250 people increase. 1,250 + 250 = 1,500 people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. Step 3: Find the percentage of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1,500/2,500 x 100% = 60% Therefore, the answer is (B) 60%. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: The output of a factory was increased by 10% to keep up with rising demand. To handle the holiday rush, this new output was increased by 25%. By approximately what percent would the output now have to be decreased in order to restore the original output? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 24% (C) 30% (D) 27% (E) 79%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the original output was 100 units. After the first increase of 10%, the new output became 110 units. After the second increase of 25%, the new output became 137.5 units (110 + 0.25*110). To restore the original output of 100 units, we need to decrease the current output of 137.5 units by a certain percentage. The percentage decrease can be calculated as follows: Percentage decrease = ((New value - Original value) / New value) * 100 = ((137.5 - 100) / 137.5) * 100 = 27.27% Therefore, the output now has to be decreased by approximately 27% to restore the original output. The closest answer choice is (D) 27%. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A part-time employee whose hourly wage was decreased by 20 percent decided to increase the number of hours worked per week so that the employee's total income did not change. By what percent E should the number of hours worked be increased? Answer Choices: (A) 12.5% (B) 20% (C) 25% (D) 50% (E) 100%\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that the employee originally worked for x hours per week and earned y dollars per week. After the wage decrease of 20%, the employee's new hourly wage is 0.8y/x dollars per hour. To maintain the same total income, the employee needs to work for more hours. Let's call the new number of hours worked per week E. The employee's new weekly income is (0.8y/x) * E dollars. We want to find the percentage increase in the number of hours worked, which is given by: (E - x)/x * 100% Setting the new weekly income equal to the original weekly income, we get: (0.8y/x) * E = y Solving for E, we get: E = 1.25x Therefore, the percentage increase in the number of hours worked is: (E - x)/x * 100% = (1.25x - x)/x * 100% = 0.25 * 100% = 25% So the answer is (C) 25%. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Of the 600 residents of Clermontville, 35% watch the television show Island Survival, 40% watch Lovelost Lawyers and 50% watch Medical Emergency. If all residents watch at least one of these three shows and 18% watch exactly 2 of these shows, then how many Clermontville residents B watch all of the shows? Answer Choices: (A)  150 (B)  108 (C)  42 (D)  21 (E)  -21\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of residents who watch at least one of the three shows. 35% + 40% + 50% = 125% This means that some residents are being counted twice or even thrice. To find the actual percentage, we need to subtract the percentage of residents who watch exactly two shows and the percentage of residents who watch all three shows. Step 2: Find the percentage of residents who watch exactly two shows. 125% - 18% = 107% Step 3: Find the percentage of residents who watch all three shows. 107% - 100% = 7% Step 4: Find the total number of residents who watch all three shows. 7% of 600 = 42 Therefore, the answer is (C) 42. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
