  "test_question": "Q: At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle? Answer Choices: (A) 50 m (B) 75 m (C) 100 m (D) 125 m (E) 150 m",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A train running at the speed of 60 km/hr crosses a pole in 15 seconds. What is the length of the train? Answer Choices: (A) 187 m (B) 250 m (C) 876 m (D) 150 m (E) 267 m\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that the train crosses a pole in 15 seconds. This means that the length of the train plus the length of the front and back gaps (if any) is equal to the distance covered by the train in 15 seconds. We need to convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s, as the time given is in seconds and the answer choices are in meters. 60 km/hr = (60 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 16.67 m/s Let's assume that there are no front or back gaps. Distance covered by the train in 15 seconds = speed x time = 16.67 x 15 = 250.05 meters Therefore, the length of the train is 250 meters. The correct answer is (B) 250 m. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Calculate the time it will take for a train that is 120 meter long to pass a bridge of 160 meter length, if the speed of the train is 40 km/hour ? Answer Choices: (A) 21.2 seconds (B) 25.2 seconds (C) 29.2 seconds (D) 35.2 seconds (E) 11.2 seconds\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/hour to m/s. 40 km/hour = (40 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 11.11 m/s (approx) Now, we need to find the total distance that the train will cover while passing the bridge. Total distance = length of train + length of bridge = 120 + 160 = 280 meters Next, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed time = 280 / 11.11 = 25.21 seconds (approx) Therefore, the answer is (B) 25.2 seconds. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A train 700 m long is running at a speed of 78 km/hr. If it crosses a tunnel in 1 min, then the length of the tunnel is? Answer Choices: (A) 298 m (B) 468 m (C) 600 m (D) 667 m (E) 781 m\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s. 78 km/hr = (78 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 21.67 m/s Next, we need to find the time taken by the train to cross the tunnel. We know that the length of the train is 700 m and it crosses the tunnel in 1 min (60 seconds). Therefore, the speed of the train relative to the tunnel is: Speed = Distance / Time Speed = (700 + Length of tunnel) / 60 Speed = (700 + Length of tunnel) / 60 Multiplying both sides by 60: Speed x 60 = 700 + Length of tunnel 21.67 x 60 = 700 + Length of tunnel 1300.2 - 700 = Length of tunnel Length of tunnel = 600.2 m Therefore, the length of the tunnel is approximately 600 m. The closest answer choice is (C) 600 m. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A man walking at a rate of 5km/hr crosses a bridge in 15 minutes. The length of the bridge is? Answer Choices: (A) 1250m (B) 1310m (C) 1500m (D) 1000m (E) 1195m\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the man's speed from km/hr to m/min since the answer choices are in meters. 5 km/hr = 5000 m/hr (since 1 km = 1000 m) 5000 m/hr = 83.33 m/min (since 1 hr = 60 min) Next, we need to use the formula: distance = speed x time We know the speed is 83.33 m/min and the time is 15 minutes. Let's plug those values in: distance = 83.33 m/min x 15 min distance = 1250 m Therefore, the length of the bridge is 1250m. The correct answer is (A) 1250m. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
