  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If (x^2 + 1)y=8, which of the following is not a possible value for y? Answer Choices: (A) 8/2 (B) 2/5 (C) 18/3 (D) 3 (E) 17/2\nA: Let's think step by step. We are given the equation (x^2 + 1)y = 8. To find the possible values of y, we need to solve for y. Dividing both sides by (x^2 + 1), we get: y = 8/(x^2 + 1) So, any value of y that makes the denominator (x^2 + 1) equal to zero is not possible, as division by zero is undefined. The denominator (x^2 + 1) is always positive, so it can never be zero. Therefore, all the given answer choices are possible values of y. Hence, the answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If (y - 1)(z - 3) + 5(y - 1) = 0, then which of the following must be true? Answer Choices: (A)  y = -4 and z = -3 (B)  y = 4 or z = -3 (C)  y = -4 or z = 3 (D)  y = 1 and z = 3 (E)  y = -1 or z = 3\nA: Let's think step by step. Expanding the left side of the equation, we get: yz - 3y - z + 3 + 5y - 5 = 0 Combining like terms, we get: yz + 2y - z - 2 = 0 Now we can factor out a (y + 1) from the first two terms and a -(z + 2) from the last two terms: (y + 1)(z + 2) = 0 Therefore, either y = -1 or z = -2. None of the answer choices match this result, so the correct answer is: None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: X is an even number and Y is a positive odd number. Which of the following expressions cannot be even? Answer Choices: (A) (XY) ^Y (B) X^3Y^3 (C) X^3 (D) XY (E) Y^2\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that X is even and Y is odd. (A) (XY)^Y: Since Y is odd, (XY)^Y will also be odd because an odd number raised to any power is odd. Therefore, this expression can't be even. (B) X^3Y^3: X is even and Y is odd, so X^3 will be even and Y^3 will be odd. Even * odd = even, so X^3Y^3 will be even. (C) X^3: X is even, so X^3 will also be even. (D) XY: Even * odd = even, so XY will be even. (E) Y^2: Y is odd, so Y^2 will be odd. Therefore, the expression that cannot be even is (A) (XY)^Y. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: If a, b, and c are consecutive odd positive integers and a<b<c, which of the following must be true?\nI. at least one of the three numbers is prime\nII. ab>c\nIII. a + b + c = 3b Answer Choices: (A) III only (B) I and II only (C) I and III only (D) II and III only (E) I, II, and III\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We are given that a, b, and c are consecutive odd positive integers and a<b<c. This means that a = b-2 and c = b+2. Now we can use this information to check the answer choices: I. At least one of the three numbers is prime: This is not necessarily true. For example, if a = 3, b = 5, and c = 7, then none of the numbers are prime. II. ab>c: We can substitute a and c in terms of b to get ab > (b+2).b or ab > b^2 + 2b. Since b is odd, we can write b = 2n+1 for some integer n. Substituting this in the inequality, we get (2n+1)(2n+3) > 4n^2 + 6n + 1 or 4n^2 + 8n + 3 > 4n^2 + 6n + 1, which is true for all n. Therefore, this statement is true. III. a + b + c = 3b: Substituting a and c in terms of b, we get (b-2) + b + (b+2) = 3b or 3b = 3b. This statement is also true. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) II and III only. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
