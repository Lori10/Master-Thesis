  "test_question": "Q: Let A and B be independent events with P (A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8. Find P(A/B)? Answer Choices: (A) 0.2 (B) 0.4 (C) 0.6 (D) 1.2 (E) 1.5",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The value of (0.2\u00d70.2+0.01) (0.1\u00d70.1+0.02)-1 is equal to Answer Choices: (A) 5/3 (B) 9/5 (C) 41/4 (D) 41/12 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can simplify the expression inside the parentheses: (0.2\u00d70.2+0.01) = 0.041 (0.1\u00d70.1+0.02) = 0.012 So now we have: 0.041 \u00d7 0.012 - 1 Simplifying further: 0.000492 - 1 -0.999508 None of the answer choices match this result, so the answer is: (E) None The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: There are two numbers. If 20% of the first number is added to the second number, then the second number increases to its five-fourth. Find the ratio of the first number to the second number? Answer Choices: (A) A) 5/4 (B) B) 5/8 (C) C) 6 (D) D) 6/7 (E) E) 7\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the first number be x and the second number be y. According to the problem, we know that: y + 0.2x = (5/4)y Simplifying this equation: 0.2x = (1/4)y x/y = (1/4)/(1/5) x/y = 5/4 Therefore, the answer is (A) 5/4. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: 5 persons A,B,C,D and E occupy seats in a row at random. What is the probability that A and B sit next to each other ? Answer Choices: (A) 3/5 (B) 2/5 (C) 1/5 (D) 8/5 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 5 people, so there are 5! = 120 ways to arrange them in a row. Now, let's consider A and B as a single entity, AB. Then, there are 4! = 24 ways to arrange the entities AB, C, D, and E in a row. However, within the entity AB, there are 2! = 2 ways to arrange A and B. So, there are 2 x 4! = 48 ways for A and B to sit next to each other. Therefore, the probability of A and B sitting next to each other is 48/120 = 2/5. The correct answer is (B) 2/5. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: (A% of 5B + B% of A) is equal to ? Answer Choices: (A) A% of B (B) B% of A (C) 6% of AB (D) AB% of 3 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. We can start by simplifying the expression given in the question: (A% of 5B + B% of A) = (A/100 * 5B) + (B/100 * A) = AB/20 + AB/100 Now, we can try to simplify this expression further: AB/20 + AB/100 = (5AB + AB)/100 = 6AB/100 = 6% of AB Therefore, the answer is (C) 6% of AB. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
