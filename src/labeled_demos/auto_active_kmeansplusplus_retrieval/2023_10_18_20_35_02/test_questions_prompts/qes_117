  "test_question": "Q: Two ants are moving from their farms towards each other. Ant A is moving at a speed of 9 cm per hour and ant B is moving at a speed of 6 cm per hour. If the farms are 75 cm away from each other, what will be the distance (in cm) that ant A travels until meeting ant B? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 51 (D) 54 (E) 57",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: What would happen in the previous question if both A and B had started at point P. Answer Choices: (A) 800 Km (B) 600 Km (C) 1000 Km (D) 350 Km (E) 250 Km\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that A travels at a speed of 50 km/h and B travels at a speed of 40 km/h. If they both started at point P, they would be moving in opposite directions. Let's say they meet after x hours. In that time, A would have traveled 50x km and B would have traveled 40x km. We also know that the distance between A and B is 600 km. So, we can set up the equation: 50x + 40x = 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 90x = 600 x = 6.67 hours Now that we know they meet after 6.67 hours, we can find out how far each of them has traveled: A: 50 km/h x 6.67 h = 333.33 km B: 40 km/h x 6.67 h = 266.67 km The total distance they have traveled is: 333.33 km + 266.67 km = 600 km Therefore, the answer is (B) 600 km. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Two goods trains each 1250 m long are running in opposite directions on parallel tracks. Their speeds are 45 km/hr and 30 km/hr respectively. Find the time taken by the slower train to pass the driver of the faster one? Answer Choices: (A) 228 (B) 278 (C) 48 (D) 27 (E) 120\nA: Let's think step by step. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds, which is 45 + 30 = 75 km/hr. We need to convert this to meters per second, so we divide by 3.6: 75 km/hr \u00f7 3.6 = 20.83 m/s Now we can find the time taken by the slower train to pass the driver of the faster one. The total distance that the slower train needs to cover is the sum of the lengths of the two trains, which is 2 \u00d7 1250 = 2500 m. Using the formula distance = speed \u00d7 time, we can find the time taken: time = distance \u00f7 speed time = 2500 m \u00f7 20.83 m/s time \u2248 120 seconds Therefore, the answer is (E) 120. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Two trains of equal lengths take 10 sec and 15 sec respectively to cross a telegraph post. If the length of each train be 120 m, in what time will they cross other travelling in opposite direction? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 12 (C) 13 (D) 14 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. The total distance covered by both trains when they cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is 240 meters. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds, since they are travelling in opposite directions. Let's call this speed \"v\". We know that the first train takes 10 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/10 = 12 m/s. Similarly, the second train takes 15 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/15 = 8 m/s. Therefore, the relative speed of the two trains is v = 12 + 8 = 20 m/s. To find the time it takes for the two trains to cross each other, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed Plugging in the values we know, we get: time = 240 / 20 = 12 seconds Therefore, the answer is (B) 12. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Two trains are running at 40 km/h and 20 km/h respectively in the same direction. Fast train completely passes a man sitting in the slower train in 5 seconds. What is the length of the fast train? Answer Choices: (A) 23 m (B) 23 2\u20449 m (C) 27 m (D) 27 7\u20449 m (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the relative speed of the two trains. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract their speeds: Relative speed = 40 km/h - 20 km/h = 20 km/h We need to convert this to meters per second (m/s) to use it in the formula for distance: 20 km/h = (20 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 5.56 m/s Now we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time We know the time (5 seconds) and the speed (5.56 m/s), so we just need to find the distance. Distance = 5.56 m/s x 5 s = 27.8 m But this is the distance traveled by both the train and the man sitting in it. We only want the length of the fast train, so we need to subtract the length of the man (assumed to be negligible) from the total distance: Length of fast train = 27.8 m - 0 m = 27.8 m None of the answer choices match this result exactly, but (D) 27 7\u20449 m is the closest. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
