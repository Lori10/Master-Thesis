  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The division of a whole number N by 13 gives a quotient of 34 and a remainder of 2. Find N. Answer Choices: (A) 797 (B) 197 (C) 597 (D) 412 (E) 444\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that N divided by 13 gives a quotient of 34 and a remainder of 2. This can be written as: N = 13 x 34 + 2 N = 442 + 2 N = 444 Therefore, the answer is (E) 444. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Dividing by 3\u20446 and then multiplying by 5\u20446 is the same as dividing by what number? Answer Choices: (A) 31\u20445 (B) 16\u20445 (C) 20\u20449 (D) 9\u204420 (E) 5\u20443\nA: Let's think step by step. Dividing by 3/6 is the same as multiplying by 6/3, which simplifies to 2. So, we have: (dividing by 3/6) x (multiplying by 5/6) = (multiplying by 6/3) x (5/6) = 2 x 5/3 = 10/3 Therefore, the answer is (E) 5/3. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: If P and Q are positive integers related by the equation P = 10Q - 5, what is the remainder when P is divided by 5? Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 2 (D) 3 (E) 4\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that P = 10Q - 5. To find the remainder when P is divided by 5, we can simplify the equation by taking the remainder of each term when divided by 5. 10Q has a remainder of 0 when divided by 5, since it is a multiple of 5. -5 has a remainder of 0 when divided by 5, since -5 = (-1) x 5. Therefore, P has a remainder of 0 - 0 = 0 when divided by 5. So the answer is (A) 0. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: What is the value of 4^5+4^6? Answer Choices: (A)  5(4^5)  (B)  4^35 (C)  17(4^5)  (D)  8^12 (E)  7(4^5) \nA: Let's think step by step. We can simplify the expression by factoring out 4^5: 4^5 + 4^6 = 4^5(1 + 4) = 4^5(5) = 5(4^5) Therefore, the answer is (A) 5(4^5). The answer is A.\n\n\n"
