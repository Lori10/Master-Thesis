  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A man traveled a total distance of 1800 km. He traveled one-third of the whole trip by plane and the distance traveled by train is three-fifth of the distance traveled by bus. If he traveled by train, plane and bus, then find the distance traveled by bus? Answer Choices: (A) 450 km (B) 850 km (C) 1200 km (D) 750 km (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the distance traveled by plane be x km. Then, the distance traveled by train is (3/5)(2/3)(1800-x) km (since he traveled one-third of the whole trip by plane). The distance traveled by bus is the remaining distance, which is 1800 - x - (3/5)(2/3)(1800-x) km. Simplifying this expression, we get: 1800 - x - (3/5)(2/3)(1800-x) = 1800 - x - (2/5)(1800-x) = 1800 - x - (3600/5 - 2x/5) = (3x/5) + 720 We want to find the value of this expression that is equal to the distance traveled by bus. Looking at the answer choices, we see that (A) 450 km is too small, (B) 850 km is too large, and (C) 1200 km is too large. So, we try (D) 750 km: (3x/5) + 720 = 750 3x/5 = 30 x = 50 Therefore, the distance traveled by plane is 50 km, the distance traveled by train is (3/5)(2/3)(1800-50) = 480 km, and the distance traveled by bus is 1800 - 50 - 480 = 1270 km. None of the answer choices match this value, so the correct answer is (E) None of these. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Rahim bought 65 books for Rs.1150 from one shop and 50 books for Rs.920 from another. What is the average price he paid per book ? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 18 (C) 99 (D) 787 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total cost of all the books Rahim bought. Total cost = Rs.1150 + Rs.920 = Rs.2070 Next, we need to find the total number of books Rahim bought. Total number of books = 65 + 50 = 115 Finally, we can find the average price per book by dividing the total cost by the total number of books. Average price per book = Total cost / Total number of books Average price per book = Rs.2070 / 115 Average price per book = Rs.18 Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 18. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Gautami went to the stationers and bought things worth Rs. 100, out of which 50 paise went on sales tax on taxable purchases. If the tax rate was 5%. then what was the cost of the tax free items? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 99.50 (B) Rs. 70.50 (C) Rs. 89.50 (D) Rs. 69.50 (E) Rs. 80.50\nA: Let's think step by step. The total cost of the items including tax is Rs. 100. Out of this, 50 paise (or Rs. 0.50) went on sales tax. We know that the tax rate is 5%. So, we can set up an equation: 5% of the taxable purchases = Rs. 0.50 To find the cost of tax-free items, we need to subtract the tax amount from the total cost: Cost of tax-free items = Total cost - Tax amount Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 100 - Rs. 0.50 Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 99.50 Therefore, the answer is (A) Rs. 99.50. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: There is a train and car. The ratio between the speed of a train & a car is 24:19 respectively. Also, a bus covered a distance of 320 km in 5 hours. The speed of the bus is 2/3rd of the speed of the train. How many kilometers will the car cover in 4 hours? Answer Choices: (A) 276 (B) 290 (C) 304 (D) 318 (E) 332\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find the speed of the train. Let the speed of the car be x km/hr. Then, the speed of the train will be (24/19)x km/hr. Given, the speed of the bus is 2/3rd of the speed of the train. So, the speed of the bus will be (2/3)(24/19)x = (16/19)x km/hr. Now, we know that the bus covered a distance of 320 km in 5 hours. So, its speed is 320/5 = 64 km/hr. Equating the speed of the bus, we get (16/19)x = 64. Solving for x, we get x = 76 km/hr. Therefore, the speed of the train is (24/19)(76) = 96 km/hr. Now, we need to find the distance covered by the car in 4 hours. Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time. Distance covered by the car in 4 hours = (76 \u00d7 4) = 304 km. Hence, the answer is (C) 304. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
