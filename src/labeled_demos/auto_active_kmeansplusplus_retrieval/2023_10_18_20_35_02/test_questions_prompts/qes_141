  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A certain amount earns simple interest of Rs. 1750 after 7 years. Had the interest been 2% more, how much more interest would it have earned? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 35 (B) Rs. 245 (C) Rs. 350 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Given, the amount earns simple interest of Rs. 1750 after 7 years. Let the principal amount be P and the rate of interest be R. Simple Interest formula is given by: S.I. = (P * R * T) / 100 Here, S.I. = Rs. 1750, T = 7 years So, 1750 = (P * R * 7) / 100 => PR = 25000 Now, if the interest rate is increased by 2%, the new rate of interest will be R + 2. New S.I. = (P * (R + 2) * T) / 100 New S.I. - Old S.I. = [(P * (R + 2) * T) / 100] - [(P * R * T) / 100] = (P * 2 * T) / 100 = (P * 2 * 7) / 100 = (14P / 100) = 0.14P We don't know the value of P, so we cannot determine the exact amount of increased interest. Therefore, the answer is (D) Cannot be determined. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In order to obtain an income of Rs. 650 from 10% stock at Rs. 96, one must make an investment of Answer Choices: (A) 5363 (B) 6240 (C) 2368 (D) 1987 (E) 2732\nA: Let's think step by step. The annual income from the stock is 10% of the investment. So, we can set up the equation: 10% of the investment = Rs. 650 0.1 x investment = 650 investment = 650 / 0.1 investment = Rs. 6,500 Now, we need to find out how many shares can be bought with an investment of Rs. 6,500 at Rs. 96 per share. Number of shares = investment / share price Number of shares = 6,500 / 96 Number of shares = 67.71 (approx.) Since we cannot buy a fraction of a share, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Number of shares = 68 Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 2732, which is the total investment required to buy 68 shares at Rs. 96 per share. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A and B invests Rs.8000 and Rs.9000 in a business. After 4 months, A withdraws half of his capital and 2 months later, B withdraws one-third of his capital. In what ratio should they share the profits at the end of the year? Answer Choices: (A) 32:45 (B) 32:37 (C) 32:41 (D) 32:47 (E) 32:48\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. Let the total profit be x. A invests Rs.8000 and B invests Rs.9000. After 4 months, A withdraws half of his capital, which means he withdraws Rs.4000. So, A's investment for the remaining 8 months is Rs.4000. B does not withdraw any amount after 4 months. After 6 months (2 months after A's withdrawal), B withdraws one-third of his capital, which means he withdraws Rs.3000. So, B's investment for the remaining 6 months is Rs.6000. Now, let's calculate the ratio of their investments for the entire year. A's investment for the year = (4/12)*8000 + (8/12)*4000 = 2667 + 2667 = 5334 B's investment for the year = (6/12)*9000 + (6/12)*6000 = 4500 + 3000 = 7500 Therefore, the ratio of their investments for the entire year is 5334:7500, which simplifies to 32:45. Hence, the answer is (A) 32:45. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Rahim bought 65 books for Rs.1150 from one shop and 50 books for Rs.920 from another. What is the average price he paid per book ? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 18 (C) 99 (D) 787 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total cost of all the books Rahim bought. Total cost = Rs.1150 + Rs.920 = Rs.2070 Next, we need to find the total number of books Rahim bought. Total number of books = 65 + 50 = 115 Finally, we can find the average price per book by dividing the total cost by the total number of books. Average price per book = Total cost / Total number of books Average price per book = Rs.2070 / 115 Average price per book = Rs.18 Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 18. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
