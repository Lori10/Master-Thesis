  "formatted_prompt": "Q: We have 4 people and 1 chairs. In how many ways chairs can be occupy? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 86 (C) 24 (D) 14 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. If we have 4 people and only 1 chair, then only one person can sit on the chair at a time. So, we need to find the number of ways in which we can choose one person out of 4 to sit on the chair. The number of ways to choose one person out of 4 is 4. Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. None of the other options are correct as they are either too high or too low for the given scenario. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In how many different orders can the people Alice, Benjamin, Charlene, David, Elaine, Frederick, Gale, and Harold be standing on line if each of Alice, Benjamin, Charlene must be on the line before each of Frederick, Gale, and Harold? Answer Choices: (A) 1,008 (B) 1,296 (C) 1,512 (D) 2,016 (E) 2,268\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to arrange Alice, Benjamin, and Charlene in a line. This can be done in 3! = 6 ways. Next, we need to arrange Frederick, Gale, and Harold in a line. This can also be done in 3! = 6 ways. Now, we have 5 people left to arrange: David, Elaine, and the 3 groups of 3 people (ABC, FGH). We can think of these 5 people as 5 slots that need to be filled. The first slot can be filled by any of the 8 people. The second slot can be filled by any of the remaining 7 people. The third slot can be filled by any of the remaining 6 people. The fourth slot can be filled by any of the remaining 5 people. The fifth slot can be filled by any of the remaining 4 people. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange all 8 people is: 6 x 6 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 = 1,296 So the answer is (B) 1,296. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: How many ways can 3 friends be arranged around a circular dinner table? Answer Choices: (A) A) 16 (B) B) 2 (C) C) 96 (D) D) 120 (E) E) 720\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We have 3 friends who need to be arranged around a circular dinner table. Step 1: Choose one friend to sit at the \"top\" of the table. This can be done in 3 ways. Step 2: Arrange the remaining 2 friends in the remaining 2 seats. This can be done in 2 ways. Step 3: Since the table is circular, we need to divide by the number of rotations. In other words, we need to divide by 3 because there are 3 ways to rotate the table and get the same arrangement. So the total number of arrangements is (3 x 2) / 3 = 2. Therefore, the answer is (B) 2. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Six students are equally divided into 3 groups, then, the three groups were assigned to three different topics. How many different arrangements Q are possible? Answer Choices: (A)  30 (B)  60 (C)  90 (D)  180 (E)  540\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We need to find the number of ways to divide 6 students equally into 3 groups. This can be done using combinations. We need to choose 2 students from 6 for the first group, then 2 students from the remaining 4 for the second group, and the remaining 2 students will be in the third group. The number of ways to choose 2 students from 6 is 6C2 = 15. The number of ways to choose 2 students from 4 is 4C2 = 6. So the total number of ways to divide 6 students equally into 3 groups is 15 x 6 = 90. Step 2: We need to find the number of ways to assign the 3 groups to 3 different topics. This can be done in 3! = 6 ways. Step 3: We need to find the total number of arrangements Q by multiplying the results of step 1 and step 2. Q = 90 x 6 = 540. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 540. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
