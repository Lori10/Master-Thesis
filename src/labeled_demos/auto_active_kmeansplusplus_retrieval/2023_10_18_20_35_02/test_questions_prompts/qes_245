  "test_question": "Q: X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ? Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In what ratio mental A at Rs.68 per kg be mixed with another metal at Rs.96 per kg so that cost of alloy (mixture) is Rs.72 per kg? Answer Choices: (A) 6:1 (B) 4:7 (C) 3:7 (D) 9:5 (E) 9:8\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the ratio of mental A to the other metal be x:y. Then, the cost of 1 kg of the alloy is given by: (68x + 96y)/(x+y) = 72 Multiplying both sides by (x+y), we get: 68x + 96y = 72(x+y) Expanding and simplifying, we get: 4x = 3y So, the ratio of mental A to the other metal is 4:3. However, this is not one of the answer choices. We can try simplifying the ratio further by dividing both sides by 3: 4/3 : 1 Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: 4 : 3 So, the ratio of mental A to the other metal is 4:3, which is equivalent to option (None of the above). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Solution A is 10% salt and Solution B is 80% salt. If you have 30 ounces of solution A and 60 ounces of solution B, in what ratio could you mix Solution A with Solution B to produce 50 ounces of a 50% salt solution? Answer Choices: (A) 6:4 (B) 6:14 (C) 3:4 (D) 4:6 (E) 3:7\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Calculate the amount of salt in Solution A and Solution B. - Solution A: 10% of 30 ounces = 3 ounces of salt - Solution B: 80% of 60 ounces = 48 ounces of salt Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the amount of salt in the final mixture. - Let x be the amount of Solution A needed to make 50 ounces of a 50% salt solution. - Then, (50 - x) is the amount of Solution B needed. - The equation is: 0.1x + 0.8(50 - x) = 0.5(50) Step 3: Solve for x. - 0.1x + 40 - 0.8x = 25 - -0.7x = -15 - x = 21.43 Step 4: Calculate the ratio of Solution A to Solution B. - Solution A: 21.43 ounces - Solution B: 50 - 21.43 = 28.57 ounces - Ratio of Solution A to Solution B = 21.43:28.57 = 3:4 Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 3:4. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The ratio between x and y is 7/5; x is multiplied by y and y is multiplied by x , what is the ratio between the new values of x and y? Answer Choices: (A) 7/5 (B) 5/7 (C) 1 (D) 49/25 (E) It Cannot Be Determined\nA: Let's think step by step. The ratio between x and y is 7/5, which means x/y = 7/5 or x = (7/5)y. When x is multiplied by y, we get xy = (7/5)y^2. Similarly, when y is multiplied by x, we get yx = (7/5)xy = (7/5)x^2. Now, we need to find the ratio between the new values of x and y, which are xy and yx, respectively. So, (xy)/(yx) = [(7/5)y^2]/[(7/5)x^2] = (y/x)^2 = (5/7)^2 = 25/49. Therefore, the answer is (D) 49/25. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: There are two numbers. If 20% of the first number is added to the second number, then the second number increases to its five-fourth. Find the ratio of the first number to the second number? Answer Choices: (A) A) 5/4 (B) B) 5/8 (C) C) 6 (D) D) 6/7 (E) E) 7\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the first number be x and the second number be y. According to the problem, we know that: y + 0.2x = (5/4)y Simplifying this equation: 0.2x = (1/4)y x/y = (1/4)/(1/5) x/y = 5/4 Therefore, the answer is (A) 5/4. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
