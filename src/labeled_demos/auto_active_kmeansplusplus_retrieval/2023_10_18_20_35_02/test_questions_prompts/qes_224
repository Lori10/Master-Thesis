  "test_question": "Q: R, S, T, and U are points on a line, and U is the midpoint of line segment ST. If the lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are 5, 17, and 22, respectively. What is the length of line segment RU? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 7 (C) 8 (D) 9 (E) 10",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A rectangular of certain dimensions is chopped off from one corner of a larger rectangle as shown. AB = 8 cm and BC = 4 cm. The perimeter of the figure ABCPQRA (in cm) is : Answer Choices: (A) 24 (B) 28 (C) 36 (D) 48 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length of PQ. We can do this by using the Pythagorean theorem since triangle APQ is a right triangle. AP^2 + PQ^2 = AQ^2 We know that AP = AB = 8 cm and AQ = AB + BC = 12 cm. Substituting these values, we get: 8^2 + PQ^2 = 12^2 64 + PQ^2 = 144 PQ^2 = 80 PQ = sqrt(80) = 4sqrt(5) cm Next, we need to find the length of QR. We can do this by using the fact that QR is equal to BC, which is 4 cm. Now we can find the perimeter of the figure by adding up the lengths of all the sides: AB + BC + CP + PQ + QR + RA + AC = 8 + 4 + PQ + 4 + 8 + 4 + 4 = 32 + PQ = 32 + 4sqrt(5) = 28 + 4sqrt(5) Therefore, the answer is (E) None of these, since none of the given options match our answer. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 99 (C) 88 (D) 77 (E) 23\nA: Let's think step by step. Let Q's age be x. Then, R's age will be (x + y) and T's age will be (x - y), where y is the age difference between Q and T. Given, (x + y) + (x - y) = 50 2x = 50 x = 25 Therefore, Q's age is 25. Also, R's age is (25 + y). Given, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, (25 + y) - 25 = 25 - (25 - y) y = 12.5 Therefore, R's age is (25 + 12.5) = 37.5 The difference between R and Q's age is (37.5 - 25) = 12.5 Hence, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: If p/7 = r/2 and r = 0.75s, what is the ratio of p to r to s? Answer Choices: (A) 2 : 3 : 4 (B) 8 : 12 : 9 (C) 21 : 6 : 8 (D) 6 : 4 : 3 (E) 12 : 8 : 3\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can simplify the given equation by cross-multiplying: 2p = 7r. Next, we can substitute the given value of r in terms of s: 2p = 7(0.75s) = 21s/4. Solving for p, we get: p = (21s/4) / 2 = 21s/8. So the ratio of p to r to s is: p : r : s = 21s/8 : 0.75s : s = 21 : 6 : 8. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 21 : 6 : 8. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A and B are two multiples of 14, and Q is the set of consecutive integers between A and B, inclusive. If Q contains 13 multiples of 14, how many multiples of 7 are there in Q? Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 24 (C) 25 (D) 26 (E) 27\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the values of A and B. Since A and B are multiples of 14, we can write A = 14x and B = 14y, where x and y are integers. Next, we know that Q contains 13 multiples of 14. Since Q includes all the integers between A and B, inclusive, we can write: B - A + 1 = 13 * 14 Substituting A = 14x and B = 14y, we get: 14y - 14x + 1 = 13 * 14 Simplifying, we get: y - x = 13 Now, we need to find the number of multiples of 7 in Q. Since A and B are both multiples of 14, we know that any multiple of 7 in Q must also be a multiple of 14. Therefore, we need to count the number of multiples of 14 in Q. The first multiple of 14 in Q is A = 14x, and the last multiple of 14 in Q is B = 14y. Therefore, the number of multiples of 14 in Q is: (y - x) + 1 = 14 Substituting y - x = 13, we get: 14 + 1 = 15 Therefore, there are 15 multiples of 14 in Q, and since each multiple of 14 is also a multiple of 7, there are 15 multiples of 7 in Q. The correct answer is (None of the above). The answer is B.\n\n\n"
