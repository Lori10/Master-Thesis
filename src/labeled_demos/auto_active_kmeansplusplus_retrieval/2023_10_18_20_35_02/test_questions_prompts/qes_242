  "test_question": "Q: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? Answer Choices: (A) 277 (B) 288 (C) 200 (D) 277 (E) 168",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The average age of students of a class is 15.8 years. The average age of boys in the class is 16.4 years and that of the girls is 15.4 years. The ration of the number of boys to the number of girls in the class is: Answer Choices: (A) 2:5 (B) 2:3 (C) 2:4 (D) 2:1 (E) 2:9\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the number of boys in the class be 'b' and the number of girls be 'g'. We know that the average age of the class is 15.8 years. So, the total age of all the students in the class = 15.8 x (b+g) We also know that the average age of boys in the class is 16.4 years. So, the total age of all the boys in the class = 16.4 x b Similarly, the total age of all the girls in the class = 15.4 x g Now, we can form an equation using the above information: (16.4 x b + 15.4 x g) / (b+g) = 15.8 Simplifying this equation, we get: 16.4b + 15.4g = 15.8b + 15.8g 0.6b = 0.4g b/g = 2/3 Therefore, the ratio of the number of boys to the number of girls in the class is 2:3. Hence, the correct answer is option (B) 2:3. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: From a group of boys and girls, 15 girls leave. They are then left 2 boys for each girl. After this, 54 boys leave. There are then 5 girls for each boy. Find the number of girls in the beginning Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 10 (C) 30 (D) 50 (E) 45\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Let's assume the number of girls in the beginning is 'g' and the number of boys is 'b'. Step 2: \"From a group of boys and girls, 15 girls leave.\" This means there are now 'g-15' girls and 'b' boys. Step 3: \"They are then left 2 boys for each girl.\" This means the number of boys is twice the number of girls. So, we can write an equation: b = 2(g-15). Step 4: \"After this, 54 boys leave.\" This means there are now 'g-15' girls and 'b-54' boys. Step 5: \"There are then 5 girls for each boy.\" This means the number of girls is five times the number of boys. So, we can write another equation: g-15 = 5(b-54). Step 6: Now we have two equations with two variables. We can solve for 'g'. b = 2(g-15) --> b = 2g - 30 g-15 = 5(b-54) --> g-15 = 5(2g-84) --> g-15 = 10g - 420 --> 9g = 405 --> g = 45 Step 7: The number of girls in the beginning is 45. Therefore, the answer is (E) 45. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Six students are equally divided into 3 groups, then, the three groups were assigned to three different topics. How many different arrangements Q are possible? Answer Choices: (A)  30 (B)  60 (C)  90 (D)  180 (E)  540\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We need to find the number of ways to divide 6 students equally into 3 groups. This can be done using combinations. We need to choose 2 students from 6 for the first group, then 2 students from the remaining 4 for the second group, and the remaining 2 students will be in the third group. The number of ways to choose 2 students from 6 is 6C2 = 15. The number of ways to choose 2 students from 4 is 4C2 = 6. So the total number of ways to divide 6 students equally into 3 groups is 15 x 6 = 90. Step 2: We need to find the number of ways to assign the 3 groups to 3 different topics. This can be done in 3! = 6 ways. Step 3: We need to find the total number of arrangements Q by multiplying the results of step 1 and step 2. Q = 90 x 6 = 540. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 540. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In how many ways can 5 boys and 3 girls be seated on 8 chairs so that no two girls are together? Answer Choices: (A) A) 5760 (B) B) 14400 (C) C) 480 (D) D) 56 (E) E) 40320\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We can seat the 5 boys in 5! ways. Step 2: We can create 4 gaps between the boys where the girls can be seated. For example, if the boys are seated as B1 B2 B3 B4 B5, the gaps are _B1_, B1_B2_, B2_B3_, B3_B4_, _B4_, where _ represents an empty chair. The girls can be seated in any 3 of these gaps in 3! ways. Step 3: We can seat the 3 girls in the chosen gaps in 3! ways. Therefore, the total number of ways to seat the boys and girls is 5! x 4 x 3! x 3! = 14,400. The answer is (B) 14,400. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
