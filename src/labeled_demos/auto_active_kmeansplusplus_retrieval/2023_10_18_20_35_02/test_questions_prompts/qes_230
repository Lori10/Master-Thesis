  "formatted_prompt": "Q: 50, 47, 45, 42, 40, 37, 35, 32, ? Answer Choices: (A) 31 (B) 30 (C) 29 (D) 28 (E) 27\nA: Let's think step by step. We can see that the sequence is decreasing by 3, then by 2, then by 3, then by 2, and so on. So, the next number in the sequence should decrease by 3 again. Starting from 32, if we subtract 3, we get 29. Therefore, the answer is (C) 29. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The sum of all consecutive odd integers from \u221225 to 35, inclusive, is Answer Choices: (A) 130 (B) 135 (C) 155 (D) 195 (E) 235\nA: Let's think step by step. The first odd integer in the sequence is -25 and the last odd integer is 35. We can find the number of terms in the sequence by using the formula: number of terms = (last term - first term)/2 + 1 number of terms = (35 - (-25))/2 + 1 = 31 So there are 31 odd integers in the sequence. To find the sum of the sequence, we can use the formula: sum = (number of terms)*(average of terms) The average of the terms is the middle term, which is the average of the first and last term: average of terms = (-25 + 35)/2 = 5 sum = 31*5 = 155 Therefore, the answer is (C) 155. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If x is equal to the sum of the integers from 30 to 50, inclusive, and y is the number of even integers from 30 to 50, inclusive, what is the value of x + y ? Answer Choices: (A) 810 (B) 811 (C) 830 (D) 850 (E) x + y=851\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the value of x, which is the sum of the integers from 30 to 50, inclusive. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: S = (n/2)(a + l) where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term. In this case, we have: n = 50 - 30 + 1 = 21 (there are 21 integers from 30 to 50, inclusive) a = 30 l = 50 So, we can plug in these values and get: x = (21/2)(30 + 50) = 21(40) = 840 Next, we need to find the value of y, which is the number of even integers from 30 to 50, inclusive. We can simply count them: 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50 There are 11 even integers in this list, so y = 11. Finally, we can add x and y to get: x + y = 840 + 11 = 851 Therefore, the answer is (E) x + y = 851. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: If the sum of five consecutive positive integers is A, then the sum of the next three consecutive integers in terms of A is: Answer Choices: (A) 3A/5 (B) 3A/5 +12 (C) A (D) 5A/3 (E) 5A/3 +12\nA: Let's think step by step. The sum of five consecutive positive integers can be expressed as: x + (x+1) + (x+2) + (x+3) + (x+4) = 5x + 10 = A Now, we need to find the sum of the next three consecutive integers. Let's call the first of these three integers y. Then, the sum of the three consecutive integers can be expressed as: y + (y+1) + (y+2) = 3y + 3 We want to express this sum in terms of A. We can use the fact that the sum of the first five consecutive integers is equal to A: 5x + 10 = A We can solve for x: 5x = A - 10 x = (A-10)/5 Now, we can substitute this expression for x into the expression for the sum of the three consecutive integers: 3y + 3 = 3((A-10)/5 + 1) + 3 = 3A/5 + 3 Therefore, the answer is (B) 3A/5 + 12. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
