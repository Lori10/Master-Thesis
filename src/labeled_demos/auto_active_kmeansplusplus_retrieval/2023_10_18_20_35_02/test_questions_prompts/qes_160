  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A jar full of whisky contains 40% alcohol. A part of this whisky is replaced by another containg 19% alcohol and now the percentage of alcohol was found to be 22%. What quantity of whisky is replaced ? Answer Choices: (A) 1/3 (B) 2/3 (C) 2/5 (D) 3/5 (E) 4/5\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the jar initially contains 100 units of whisky. Out of these 100 units, 40 units are alcohol. Let's say x units of whisky are replaced with the new whisky containing 19% alcohol. So, the amount of alcohol in the new mixture will be: 40 - 0.4x (alcohol in the original mixture) + 0.19x (alcohol in the new mixture) The total amount of whisky in the new mixture will be: 100 - x (original amount) + x (new amount) Now, we are given that the percentage of alcohol in the new mixture is 22%. So, we can set up the equation: (40 - 0.4x + 0.19x)/(100) = 0.22 Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 2/5 Therefore, 2/5 of the original amount of whisky is replaced with the new whisky containing 19% alcohol. So, the answer is (C) 2/5. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: How many kilograms of tea powder costing Rs. 31 per kg be mixed with 36 kilograms of tea powder costing Rs. 43 per kg, such that the mixture when sold at Rs. 44 per kg gives profit of 10%? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 15 (C) 20 (D) 10 (E) 30\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve the problem step by step. Let the required quantity of tea powder costing Rs. 31 per kg be x kg. The cost of 36 kg of tea powder costing Rs. 43 per kg is 36 x 43 = Rs. 1548. To make a profit of 10%, the selling price of the mixture per kg should be 1.1 times the cost price per kg. Therefore, the selling price of the mixture per kg is Rs. 1.1 x 44 = Rs. 48.4. The total cost of the mixture is the sum of the cost of the two types of tea powder. So, 31x + 1548 = (x + 36) x 44 Solving this equation, we get x = 20. Therefore, 20 kg of tea powder costing Rs. 31 per kg should be mixed with 36 kg of tea powder costing Rs. 43 per kg to get a mixture that can be sold at Rs. 44 per kg with a profit of 10%. Hence, the answer is (C) 20. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Salad dressing P is made up of 30% vinegar and 70% oil, and salad dressing Q contains 10% vinegar and 90% oil. If the two dressings are combined to produce a salad dressing that is 12% vinegar, dressing P comprises what percentage of the new dressing? Answer Choices: (A) 50% (B) 40% (C) 30% (D) 20% (E) 10%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that we have 100 ml of the new salad dressing. Let x be the percentage of dressing P in the new dressing. Then, we can write: - The amount of vinegar in dressing P = 30% of x ml - The amount of vinegar in dressing Q = 10% of (100 - x) ml (since the total amount of dressing is 100 ml and we have x ml of dressing P) - The amount of vinegar in the new dressing = 12% of 100 ml = 12 ml Since we are combining the two dressings, the total amount of vinegar in the new dressing is the sum of the amount of vinegar in dressing P and dressing Q. So, we can write: 0.3x + 0.1(100 - x) = 12 Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.2x + 10 = 12 0.2x = 2 x = 10 Therefore, dressing P comprises 10% of the new dressing. The correct answer is (E) 10%. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: the ratio of water and milk is 2:3.after adding 4litre milk ratio become 1:2? calculate amount of water? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 8 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. Initially, let's assume that the amount of water in the mixture is 2x and the amount of milk is 3x. So, the total amount of the mixture is 2x + 3x = 5x. After adding 4 liters of milk, the total amount of the mixture becomes 5x + 4. Now, the ratio of water to milk is 1:2, which means the amount of water is x and the amount of milk is 2x. So, we can write the equation as: 2x + 4 = 2(2x) Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x + 4 = 4x 2x = 4 x = 2 Therefore, the amount of water in the mixture initially was 2x = 2(2) = 4 liters. So, the correct answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the calculated answer. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
