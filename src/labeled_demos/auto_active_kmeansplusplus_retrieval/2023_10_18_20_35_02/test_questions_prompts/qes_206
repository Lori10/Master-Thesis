  "test_question": "Q: On dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, we get the same remainder. The sum of the digits of N is: Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11 (C) 12 (D) 13 (E) 14",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The division of a whole number N by 13 gives a quotient of 34 and a remainder of 2. Find N. Answer Choices: (A) 797 (B) 197 (C) 597 (D) 412 (E) 444\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that N divided by 13 gives a quotient of 34 and a remainder of 2. This can be written as: N = 13 x 34 + 2 N = 442 + 2 N = 444 Therefore, the answer is (E) 444. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: How many three-digit whole numbers yield a remainder of 1 when divided by 10 and also yield a remainder of 1 when divided by 6? Answer Choices: (A) None (B) One (C) Two (D) Three (E) Four\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 10. These numbers are of the form 10a + 1, where a is an integer. Next, we need to find the numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 6. These numbers are of the form 6b + 1, where b is an integer. To find the numbers that satisfy both conditions, we need to find the values of a and b that make 10a + 1 and 6b + 1 equal. 10a + 1 = 6b + 1 Simplifying, we get: 10a = 6b Dividing both sides by 2, we get: 5a = 3b This means that a must be a multiple of 3 and b must be a multiple of 5. The smallest three-digit number that satisfies both conditions is 121 (10*12+1). The next number is 181 (10*18+1). Therefore, the answer is (C) Two. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If the number 52,1n9, where n represents the tens digit, is a multiple of 3, then the value of n could be which of the following? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 5 (C) 3 (D) 1 (E) 0\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine if a number is a multiple of 3, we need to add up its digits and see if the sum is a multiple of 3. So, 52,1n9 = 5 + 2 + 1 + n + 9 = 17 + n. For 17 + n to be a multiple of 3, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3. The only answer choice that works is (A) 6, because 17 + 6 = 23, which is a multiple of 3 (since 2 + 3 = 5, which is not a multiple of 3). Therefore, the value of n could be 6. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: what is the smallest number should be added to 5377 so that the sum is completely divisible by 7? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 4 (C) 6 (D) 2 (E) 1\nA: Let's think step by step. To make a number completely divisible by 7, we need to add the smallest number that will make the sum a multiple of 7. We can find this number by taking the remainder of the original number when divided by 7 and subtracting it from 7. So, let's find the remainder of 5377 when divided by 7: 5377 \u00f7 7 = 768 R 1 So, the remainder is 1. To make the sum completely divisible by 7, we need to add: 7 - 1 = 6 Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 6. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
