We can simplify the expression by factoring out 4^5: 4^5 + 4^6 = 4^5(1 + 4) = 4^5(5) = 5(4^5) Therefore, the answer is (A) 5(4^5). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: (8^16)+(16^13)+(4^22) = ? Answer Choices: (A) (4) *(2^29+1)  (B) (6) *(2^48)  (C) (9) *(2^49)  (D) (28) *(2^53)  (E) 2^148\nA: Let's think step by step. We can simplify the expression by noticing that all three terms have a common factor of 2^26. So, we can write: (8^16) + (16^13) + (4^22) = (2^3)^16 + (2^4)^13 + (2^2)^22 = 2^(3*16) + 2^(4*13) + 2^(2*22) = 2^48 + 2^52 + 2^44 Now, we can factor out 2^44 from all three terms: (8^16) + (16^13) + (4^22) = 2^44(2^4 + 2^8 + 2^0) Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses, we get: 2^4 + 2^8 + 2^0 = 16 + 256 + 1 = 273 Therefore, the final answer is: (8^16) + (16^13) + (4^22) = 2^44 * 273 = 9 * 2^49 So, the correct answer is (C) 9 * 2^49. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: How many 4-digit Q numbers (ABCD) can be formed such that |A \u2013 D| = 2? Answer Choices: (A) 2,000 (B) 1,900 (C) 1,800 (D) 1,600 (E) 1,500\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that |A \u2013 D| = 2. This means that A and D are either 2 digits apart or 2 digits away from each other in the number line. Case 1: A is 2 digits greater than D. In this case, we can choose any digit from 1 to 9 for D (since it's a 4-digit number, we can't have 0 as the first digit). Then, A can be any digit that is 2 greater than D, except for 9 (since we can't have a 5th digit). So, there are 8 choices for A. Case 2: D is 2 digits greater than A. This is the same as Case 1, but with A and D switched. So, there are also 8 choices for A in this case. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit Q numbers that can be formed is 8 + 8 = 16. The answer is (D) 1,600. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If you roll one fair six-sided die, what is the probability that the number is even or less than 4? Answer Choices: (A) 1/6 (B) 1/3 (C) 2/ 3 (D) 3/4 (E) 5/6\nA: Let's think step by step. There are three even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. There are also two odd numbers less than 4: 1 and 3. So, there are a total of 5 outcomes that satisfy the condition of being even or less than 4. The probability of rolling one of these outcomes is therefore 5/6. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 5/6. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
