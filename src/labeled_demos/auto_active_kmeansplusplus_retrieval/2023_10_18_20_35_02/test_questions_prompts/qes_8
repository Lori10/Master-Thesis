  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Calculate how many men are needed to finish a specific task in 5 days if it will take 15 men to complete the same task in 10 days. ? Answer Choices: (A) 13 (B) 16 (C) 35 (D) 25 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the formula: (number of men) x (number of days) = (amount of work) Let's call the number of men needed to finish the task in 5 days \"x\". So we have: x * 5 = 15 * 10 Simplifying: x = 30 Therefore, 30 men are needed to finish the task in 5 days. Answer: None of the above (not one of the answer choices is 30). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: 15 men take 20 days of 8 hours each to do a piece of work. How many days of 6 hours each would 21 women take to do the same. If 3 women do as much work as 2 men? Answer Choices: (A) 27.57 (B) 28.57 (C) 29.57 (D) 30.57 (E) 32\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total work done by 15 men in 20 days of 8 hours each. 15 men take 20 days of 8 hours each to do a piece of work. So, the total work done by 15 men = 15 * 20 * 8 = 2400 man-hours. Step 2: Find the work done by 1 man in 1 hour. The work done by 1 man in 1 hour = Total work done by 15 men / (15 * 20) = 2400 / 300 = 8 man-hours. Step 3: Find the work done by 1 woman in 1 hour. 3 women do as much work as 2 men. So, the work done by 1 woman in 1 hour = Work done by 2 men in 1 hour / 3 = 2 * 8 / 3 = 16 / 3 woman-hours. Step 4: Find the total work done by 21 women in x days of 6 hours each. Let the total work done by 21 women in x days of 6 hours each be y woman-hours. So, y = 21 * x * 6 * (16 / 3) = 672x woman-hours. Step 5: Equate the work done by 15 men and 21 women. 2400 man-hours = 672x woman-hours. x = 2400 / (672 * (16 / 3)) = 30.57 days. Therefore, the answer is (D) 30.57. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A work which could be finished in 10 days was finished 3 days earlier after 10 more men joined. The number of men employed was? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 20 (C) 88 (D) 71 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the number of men initially employed be x. Then, the work done in 1 day by x men is 1/10 and the work done in 1 day by (x+10) men is 1/(10-3) = 1/7 (since the work was finished 3 days earlier). Now, we can set up an equation based on the work done by x men and (x+10) men: x/10 + (x+10)/7 = 1 Multiplying both sides by 70 (the least common multiple of 10 and 7) gives: 7x + 10(x+10) = 70 Simplifying and solving for x gives: 17x = 60 x = 60/17 Since x is not a whole number, none of the answer choices are correct. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: A can do a work in 7 days B in 12 days and C in 5 days. If they work on it together then in how many days required to complete the work? Answer Choices: (A) 420/177 (B) 420/179 (C) 410/87 (D) 90/14 (E) 77/56\nA: Let's think step by step. We can start by finding the individual rates of work for each person. A can do the work in 7 days, so their rate of work is 1/7. B can do the work in 12 days, so their rate of work is 1/12. C can do the work in 5 days, so their rate of work is 1/5. To find the combined rate of work when they work together, we add up their individual rates of work: 1/7 + 1/12 + 1/5 = 60/420 + 35/420 + 84/420 = 179/420 So when they work together, their combined rate of work is 179/420. To find how long it will take them to complete the work, we can use the formula: time = work / rate The work they need to do is 1 (the whole job), and their combined rate of work is 179/420. time = 1 / (179/420) = 420/179 Therefore, the answer is (B) 420/179. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
