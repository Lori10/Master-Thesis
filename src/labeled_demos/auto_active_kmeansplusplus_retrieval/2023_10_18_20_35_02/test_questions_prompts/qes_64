  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The Shopkeeper increased the price of a product by 25% so that customer finds it difficult to purchase the required amount. But somehow the customer managed to purchase only 70% of the required amount. What is the net difference in the expenditure on that product? Answer Choices: (A) 12.5% (B) 13% (C) 15% (D) 17% (E) 19%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the original price of the product was $100. After increasing the price by 25%, the new price becomes $125. Now, the customer only purchases 70% of the required amount. This means the customer only spends 70% of the amount they would have spent if they had purchased the required amount. So, the customer spends 70% of $125, which is $87.50. The net difference in expenditure can be calculated by finding the percentage decrease in expenditure. The original expenditure would have been 100% of $125, which is $125. The actual expenditure is $87.50. So, the percentage decrease in expenditure is: ((125 - 87.5)/125) x 100% = 30/125 x 100% = 24% Therefore, the net difference in expenditure is 24%. None of the answer choices match the calculated answer, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The salary of a person was reduced by 20%. By what percent should his reduced salary be raised so as to bring it at par with his original salary? Answer Choices: (A) 50% (B) 32% (C) 25% (D) 43% (E) 29%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the original salary was $100. After a 20% reduction, the new salary becomes $80. Now, we need to find out what percentage increase is needed to bring the reduced salary of $80 back up to the original salary of $100. Let x be the percentage increase needed. We can set up the following equation: $80 + (x/100) * $80 = $100 Simplifying this equation: $80 + 0.8x = $100 0.8x = $20 x = 25 Therefore, the reduced salary needs to be raised by 25% to bring it back up to the original salary. The answer is (C) 25%. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A part-time employee whose hourly wage was decreased by 20 percent decided to increase the number of hours worked per week so that the employee's total income did not change. By what percent E should the number of hours worked be increased? Answer Choices: (A) 12.5% (B) 20% (C) 25% (D) 50% (E) 100%\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that the employee originally worked for x hours per week and earned y dollars per week. After the wage decrease of 20%, the employee's new hourly wage is 0.8y/x dollars per hour. To maintain the same total income, the employee needs to work for more hours. Let's call the new number of hours worked per week E. The employee's new weekly income is (0.8y/x) * E dollars. We want to find the percentage increase in the number of hours worked, which is given by: (E - x)/x * 100% Setting the new weekly income equal to the original weekly income, we get: (0.8y/x) * E = y Solving for E, we get: E = 1.25x Therefore, the percentage increase in the number of hours worked is: (E - x)/x * 100% = (1.25x - x)/x * 100% = 0.25 * 100% = 25% So the answer is (C) 25%. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Paul's income is 40% less than Rex's income, Quentin's income is 20% less than Paul's income, and Sam's income is 40% less than Paul's income. If Rex gave 40% of his income to Sam and 60% of his income to Quentin, Quentin's new income would be what fraction of Sam's new income? Answer Choices: (A) \t11/12 (B) \t13/17 (C) \t13/19 (D) \t12/19 (E) \t27/19\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume Rex's income to be 100. Then, Paul's income would be 60 (40% less than Rex's income). Quentin's income would be 48 (20% less than Paul's income). Sam's income would be 36 (40% less than Paul's income). If Rex gave 40% of his income to Sam, Sam's new income would be 76 (40% of 100 is 40, so Rex would have 60 left to give to Quentin and keep for himself). If Rex gave 60% of his income to Quentin, Quentin's new income would be 88 (60% of 100 is 60, so Quentin would have 48 from his original income and 60 from Rex's gift). So, Quentin's new income is 88/76 = 22/19 of Sam's new income. Therefore, the answer is (E) 27/19. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
