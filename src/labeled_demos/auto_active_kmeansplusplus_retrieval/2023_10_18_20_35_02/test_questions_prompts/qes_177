  "test_question": "Q: A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate? Answer Choices: (A) 1.5% (B) 4.5% (C) 10% (D) 5% (E) 12%",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: An amount of Rs. 3000 becomes Rs. 3600 in four years at simple interest. If the rate of interest was 1% more, then what was be the total amount? Answer Choices: (A) 3728 (B) 3726 (C) 3720 (D) 3722 (E) 3721\nA: Let's think step by step. Given, Principal (P) = Rs. 3000, Time (t) = 4 years, Simple Interest (SI) = Rs. 3600 - Rs. 3000 = Rs. 600. Using the formula for simple interest, we can find the rate of interest (R): SI = (P * R * t) / 100 600 = (3000 * R * 4) / 100 R = 5% Now, if the rate of interest is 1% more, then the new rate of interest (R') would be: R' = R + 1% = 5 + 0.01 = 0.06 Using the same formula for simple interest, we can find the new amount (A): A = P + SI A = 3000 + (3000 * 0.06 * 4) / 100 A = Rs. 3720 Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 3720. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A money lender finds that due to a fall in the annual rate of interest from 8% to 7 3/4 % his yearly income diminishes by Rs. 60.50, his capital is? Answer Choices: (A) 24,200 (B) 28,888 (C) 24,600 (D) 24,628 (E) 24,6012\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the capital be x. Then, 8% of x - 7.75% of x = 60.50 0.25% of x = 60.50 1% of x = 60.50/0.25 x = 24,200 Therefore, the answer is (A) 24,200. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A sum of Rs. 2665 is lent into two parts so that the interest on the first part for 8 years at 3% per annum may be equal to the interest on the second part for 3 years at 5% per annum. Find the second sum? Answer Choices: (A) Rs.1678 (B) Rs.1640 (C) Rs.2341 (D) Rs.3041 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the first sum be x. According to the question, the interest on the first part for 8 years at 3% per annum is equal to the interest on the second part for 3 years at 5% per annum. Using the formula for simple interest, we can write: Interest on first part = (x * 3 * 8)/100 = 24x/100 Interest on second part = [(2665 - x) * 5 * 3]/100 = 15(2665 - x)/100 Since both interests are equal, we can equate them: 24x/100 = 15(2665 - x)/100 Simplifying this equation, we get: 24x = 15(2665 - x) 24x = 39975 - 15x 39x = 39975 x = 1025 Therefore, the first sum is Rs. 1025. To find the second sum, we subtract the first sum from the total sum: Second sum = 2665 - 1025 = Rs. 1640 Hence, the answer is (B) Rs. 1640. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: How much time will it take for an amount of Rs. 450 to yield Rs. 81 as interest at 4.5 % per annum of simple interest ? Answer Choices: (A) 3.5 years (B) 4 years (C) 4.5 years (D) 5 years (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that Simple Interest (SI) = (P * R * T) / 100, where P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest and T is the time period. Here, P = Rs. 450, SI = Rs. 81 and R = 4.5% Substituting the values in the formula, we get: 81 = (450 * 4.5 * T) / 100 Simplifying this equation, we get: T = (81 * 100) / (450 * 4.5) T = 4 years Therefore, the answer is (B) 4 years. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
