  "test_question": "Q: A number is as much greater than 36 as is less than 86. Find the Number. Answer Choices: (A) 60 (B) 56 (C) 51 (D) 61 (E) 41",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: 56, 63, 59, 11, 57, 6, 11\nWhich of the following numbers is lower than the median but greater than the mean of the set of the numbers in the list? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 32 (C) 49 (D) 56 (E) 58\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the median of the set of numbers. To do this, we need to arrange the numbers in order from least to greatest: 6, 11, 11, 56, 57, 59, 63 The median is the middle number, which is 56. Next, we need to find the mean of the set of numbers: (6 + 11 + 11 + 56 + 57 + 59 + 63) / 7 = 38 So, we are looking for a number that is lower than 56 but greater than 38. Option (B) 32 is lower than both the median and the mean, so it is not the answer. Option (A) 21 is lower than both the median and the mean, so it is not the answer. Option (C) 49 is greater than the mean but also greater than the median, so it is not the answer. Option (D) 56 is equal to the median, so it is not the answer. Option (E) 58 is greater than the median, so it is not the answer. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Which of the following values is the greatest Answer Choices: (A) a)  30% of 89 (B) b)  22% of 78 (C) c)  33% of 67 (D) d)  44% of 56 (E) e)  55% of 45\nA: Let's think step by step. A) 30% of 89 = 0.3 x 89 = 26.7 B) 22% of 78 = 0.22 x 78 = 17.16 C) 33% of 67 = 0.33 x 67 = 22.11 D) 44% of 56 = 0.44 x 56 = 24.64 E) 55% of 45 = 0.55 x 45 = 24.75 Therefore, the greatest value is option (E) 55% of 45. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: If you add all the numbers on your mobile phone except 9, what is the answer? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 28 (C) 65 (D) 36 (E) 42\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to identify all the numbers on a mobile phone except 9. These are the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Next, we need to add all these digits together. 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36 Therefore, the answer is (D) 36. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: The average of 10 numbers was calculated as 20. It is discovered later on that while calculating the average, one number, namely 86, was incorrectly read as 26. What is the correct average? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 23 (C) 24 (D) 25 (E) 26\nA: Let's think step by step. The sum of the 10 numbers is 10 x 20 = 200 (since the average is 20). If 86 was incorrectly read as 26, then the sum of the 10 numbers should have been 200 - 26 + 86 = 260. Therefore, the correct average is 260/10 = 26. So, the answer is (E) 26. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
