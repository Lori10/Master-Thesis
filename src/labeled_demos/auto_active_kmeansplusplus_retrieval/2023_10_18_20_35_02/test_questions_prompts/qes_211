If the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi-annually, which of the following is the amount of money that Charles originally invested? Answer Choices: (A) $45,000 (B) $50,000 (C) $54,000 (D) $59,000 (E) $62,000",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If money is invested at r percent interest, compounded annually, the amount of the investment will double in approximately 50/r years. If Luke's parents invested $15,500 in a long term bond that pays 12 percent interest compounded annually, what will be the approximate total amount of the investment 12 years later, when Luke is ready for college? Answer Choices: (A) 62,000 (B) 85,500 (C) 95,500 (D) 100,500 (E) 120,000\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many times the investment will double in 12 years. Using the formula given in the problem, we can calculate that the investment will double approximately every 4.17 years (50/12). Therefore, the investment will double approximately 2.88 times (12/4.17). Next, we need to calculate the final amount of the investment after 12 years. To do this, we can use the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) Where: A = final amount P = principal (initial investment) r = annual interest rate (as a decimal) n = number of times interest is compounded per year t = time (in years) Plugging in the given values, we get: A = 15500(1 + 0.12/1)^(1*12) A = 15500(1.12)^12 A \u2248 55,500 Finally, we need to multiply this amount by the number of times the investment doubled: 55,500 * 2.88 \u2248 159,840 Therefore, the approximate total amount of the investment 12 years later is $159,840. None of the answer choices provided match this result. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A money lender finds that due to a fall in the annual rate of interest from 8% to 7 3/4 % his yearly income diminishes by Rs. 60.50, his capital is? Answer Choices: (A) 24,200 (B) 28,888 (C) 24,600 (D) 24,628 (E) 24,6012\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the capital be x. Then, 8% of x - 7.75% of x = 60.50 0.25% of x = 60.50 1% of x = 60.50/0.25 x = 24,200 Therefore, the answer is (A) 24,200. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: If $10,000 is invested at x percent simple annual interest for n years, which of the following represents the total amount of interest, in dollars, that will be earned by this investment in the n years? Answer Choices: (A) 10,000(x^n)  (B) 10,000(x/100) ^n (C) 10,000n(x/100)  (D) 10,000(1+x/100) ^n (E) 10,000n(1+x/100) \nA: Let's think step by step. The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time In this case, the principal is $10,000, the rate is x percent (which we need to convert to a decimal by dividing by 100), and the time is n years. So, the total amount of interest earned in n years is: Interest = 10,000 * (x/100) * n Simplifying this expression, we get: Interest = 100 * x * n Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 10,000n(x/100). The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Mike invested Rs. 3750 in a scheme for 3 years at compound interest rate 6.5% p.a. How much amount will Mike get on maturity of the fixed deposit? Answer Choices: (A) s.4581.29 (B) s.4450 (C) s.4500 (D) s.4500.25 (E) s.4529.81\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the formula for compound interest to solve this problem: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) Where: A = the amount at the end of the investment P = the principal amount (initial investment) r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal) n = the number of times the interest is compounded per year t = the time period of the investment (in years) Plugging in the given values, we get: A = 3750(1 + 0.065/1)^(1*3) A = 3750(1.065)^3 A = 3750(1.207) A = 4522.50 Therefore, the closest answer choice is (E) s.4529.81. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
