  "test_question": "Q: In an exam, a candidate secured 504 marks of the maximum mark of M. If the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, he would have secured 420 marks. What is the value of M? Answer Choices: (A) 278 (B) 2890 (C) 270 (D) 2702 (E) 960",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A student has to obtain 33% of the total marks to pass. He got 59 marks and failed by 40 marks. The maximum marks are? Answer Choices: (A) 450 (B) 300 (C) 500 (D) 610 (E) 175\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the maximum marks be x. The student got 59 marks and failed by 40 marks, which means he needed 33% of the total marks to pass. 33% of x can be written as 0.33x. So, we can set up the equation: 0.33x = 59 + 40 0.33x = 99 x = 99/0.33 x = 300 Therefore, the maximum marks are 300. The correct answer is (B) 300. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In a class of 25 students in an examination in maths 3 students scored 95 marks each, 5 get zero each and the average of the rest was 45. What is the average of the whole class? Answer Choices: (A) A) 47 (B) B) 45.6 (C) C) 42 (D) D) 48 (E) E) 49\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total marks obtained by the class. Total marks obtained by the class = (3 students * 95 marks each) + (5 students * 0 marks each) + (17 students * 45 marks each) = 285 + 0 + 765 = 1050 Now, we can find the average of the whole class by dividing the total marks obtained by the number of students. Average of the whole class = Total marks obtained by the class / Number of students = 1050 / 25 = 42 Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 42. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Rajesh solved 80 per cent of the questions in an examination correctly. If out of 41 questions solved by Rajesh 37 questions are correct and of the remaining questions out of 8 questions 5 questions have been solved by Rajesh correctly then find the total number of questions asked in the examination. Answer Choices: (A) 75 (B) 65 (C) 60 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Rajesh solved 80% of the questions correctly. This means that he got 37 questions correct out of a total of x questions. We can write this as: 0.8x = 37 Solving for x, we get: x = 46.25 However, we know that the number of questions asked in the examination must be a whole number. Therefore, we can assume that the actual number of questions asked is either 46 or 47. Next, we know that Rajesh solved a total of 41 questions. Of these, 37 were correct and 4 were incorrect. This means that he attempted 8 - 4 = 4 questions in the remaining set of questions. We also know that he got 5 out of these 8 questions correct. Therefore, the total number of questions asked in the examination is: 37 + 4 + 5 = 46 So the answer is (A) 75. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A pupil's marks were wrongly entered as 85 instead of 45. Due to that the average marks for the class got increased by half. The number of pupils in the class is : Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 80 (C) 20 (D) 25 (E) 26\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume there were 'n' pupils in the class before the wrong entry was made. The total marks of all the pupils before the correction = n * average marks After the correction, the total marks of all the pupils = (n-1) * average marks + 85 We know that the average marks increased by half, which means: (n-1) * average marks + 85 = (n * average marks) + (0.5 * n * average marks) Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.5 * n * average marks = 85 - average marks 0.5 * n * average marks = 40 n * average marks = 80 We know that the average marks of the class is (85 + 45)/2 = 65 So, n * 65 = 80 n = 80/65 = 1.23 Since the number of pupils cannot be a decimal, we can round it up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the number of pupils in the class is 25. Hence, the answer is (D) 25. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
