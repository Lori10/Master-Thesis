  "test_question": "Q: A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A can do a work in 7 days B in 12 days and C in 5 days. If they work on it together then in how many days required to complete the work? Answer Choices: (A) 420/177 (B) 420/179 (C) 410/87 (D) 90/14 (E) 77/56\nA: Let's think step by step. We can start by finding the individual rates of work for each person. A can do the work in 7 days, so their rate of work is 1/7. B can do the work in 12 days, so their rate of work is 1/12. C can do the work in 5 days, so their rate of work is 1/5. To find the combined rate of work when they work together, we add up their individual rates of work: 1/7 + 1/12 + 1/5 = 60/420 + 35/420 + 84/420 = 179/420 So when they work together, their combined rate of work is 179/420. To find how long it will take them to complete the work, we can use the formula: time = work / rate The work they need to do is 1 (the whole job), and their combined rate of work is 179/420. time = 1 / (179/420) = 420/179 Therefore, the answer is (B) 420/179. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Richard has to paint a mural with seven horizontal stripes. He only has enough paint for four red stripes, four blue stripes, four white stripes. If his patron wants at most two different colors in the mural, how many different ways can he paint the wall? Answer Choices: (A) 210 (B) 350 (C) 700 (D) 2,520 (E) 5,040\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to consider the case where Richard uses only one color. He can choose any of the three colors, so there are 3 ways to paint the mural with only one color. Next, we need to consider the case where Richard uses two colors. He can choose any two colors out of the three, which can be done in 3C2 = 3 ways. For each choice of colors, he can paint the mural in the following ways: - 2 stripes of one color, 5 stripes of the other color: 4C2 x 4C5 = 6 x 4 = 24 - 3 stripes of one color, 4 stripes of the other color: 4C3 x 4C4 = 4 x 1 = 4 So, there are 3 x (24 + 4) = 84 ways to paint the mural with two colors. Therefore, the total number of ways to paint the mural is 3 + 84 = 87. None of the above answer choices match our answer, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Calculate how many men are needed to finish a specific task in 5 days if it will take 15 men to complete the same task in 10 days. ? Answer Choices: (A) 13 (B) 16 (C) 35 (D) 25 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the formula: (number of men) x (number of days) = (amount of work) Let's call the number of men needed to finish the task in 5 days \"x\". So we have: x * 5 = 15 * 10 Simplifying: x = 30 Therefore, 30 men are needed to finish the task in 5 days. Answer: None of the above (not one of the answer choices is 30). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: 15 men take 20 days of 8 hours each to do a piece of work. How many days of 6 hours each would 21 women take to do the same. If 3 women do as much work as 2 men? Answer Choices: (A) 27.57 (B) 28.57 (C) 29.57 (D) 30.57 (E) 32\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total work done by 15 men in 20 days of 8 hours each. 15 men take 20 days of 8 hours each to do a piece of work. So, the total work done by 15 men = 15 * 20 * 8 = 2400 man-hours. Step 2: Find the work done by 1 man in 1 hour. The work done by 1 man in 1 hour = Total work done by 15 men / (15 * 20) = 2400 / 300 = 8 man-hours. Step 3: Find the work done by 1 woman in 1 hour. 3 women do as much work as 2 men. So, the work done by 1 woman in 1 hour = Work done by 2 men in 1 hour / 3 = 2 * 8 / 3 = 16 / 3 woman-hours. Step 4: Find the total work done by 21 women in x days of 6 hours each. Let the total work done by 21 women in x days of 6 hours each be y woman-hours. So, y = 21 * x * 6 * (16 / 3) = 672x woman-hours. Step 5: Equate the work done by 15 men and 21 women. 2400 man-hours = 672x woman-hours. x = 2400 / (672 * (16 / 3)) = 30.57 days. Therefore, the answer is (D) 30.57. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
