  "test_question": "Q: An aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square at the speeds of 200, 400, 600 and 800km/hr. Find the average speed of the plane around the field? Answer Choices: (A) 384 (B) 562 (C) 458 (D) 156 (E) 452",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A person crosses a 600 m long street in 2 minutes. What is his speed in km per hour? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 24 (C) 18 (D) 42 (E) 64\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the distance from meters to kilometers. We can do this by dividing 600 by 1000, which gives us 0.6 km. Next, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. We can do this by dividing 2 by 60, which gives us 0.0333 hours (rounded to four decimal places). Finally, we can calculate the speed by dividing the distance by the time. So, speed = distance/time = 0.6/0.0333 = 18 (rounded to the nearest whole number). Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 18. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A driver covers a certain distance by car driving at 60 km/hr and returns back to the starting point riding on a scooter at 10 km/hr. What was the average speed for the whole journey? Answer Choices: (A) 14.2 km/h (B) 17.1 km/h (C) 19.3 km/h (D) 21.7 km/h (E) 23.5 km/h\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the distance covered by the driver is 'd' km. The time taken to cover the distance by car at 60 km/hr is given by: Time taken = Distance/Speed = d/60 The time taken to cover the same distance by scooter at 10 km/hr is given by: Time taken = Distance/Speed = d/10 The total time taken for the whole journey is the sum of the time taken for the onward journey and the time taken for the return journey. Total time taken = d/60 + d/10 = (d + 6d)/60 = 7d/60 The average speed for the whole journey is given by: Average speed = Total distance/Total time taken Total distance = 2d (since the driver covers the same distance twice) Average speed = 2d/(7d/60) = 120/7 km/hr Rounding off to one decimal place, we get the answer as (A) 14.2 km/h. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A car covers a distance of 624 km in 2 2/5 hours. Find its speed? Answer Choices: (A) 104 kmph (B) 194 kmph (C) 109 kmph (D) 260 kmph (E) 271 kmph\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that speed = distance/time. Here, the distance covered by the car is 624 km and the time taken is 2 2/5 hours. To convert the mixed fraction to an improper fraction, we can multiply the whole number (2) by the denominator (5) and add the numerator (2) to get 12/5. So, time taken = 12/5 hours. Now, we can substitute these values in the formula: Speed = distance/time Speed = 624/(12/5) Speed = 624 * 5/12 Speed = 260 kmph Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 260 kmph. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A train moves fast a telegraph post and a bridge 264 m long in 8 sec and 40 sec respectively. What is the speed of the train? Answer Choices: (A) 89 (B) 29.7 (C) 56 (D) 79.2 (E) 67\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the speed of the train when it passes the telegraph post. We can use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time The distance is given as 264 meters and the time taken is 8 seconds. So, the speed of the train when it passes the telegraph post is: Speed = 264 / 8 = 33 m/s Next, we need to find the speed of the train when it crosses the bridge. The distance is given as 264 meters, but this time the time taken is 40 seconds. So, the speed of the train when it crosses the bridge is: Speed = 264 / 40 = 6.6 m/s Now, we need to find the average speed of the train for the entire journey. We can use the formula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time The total distance is the sum of the distance covered when passing the telegraph post and the distance covered when crossing the bridge. So, the total distance is: Total Distance = 264 + 264 = 528 meters The total time is the sum of the time taken to pass the telegraph post and the time taken to cross the bridge. So, the total time is: Total Time = 8 + 40 = 48 seconds Now, we can find the average speed of the train: Average Speed = 528 / 48 = 11 m/s Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
