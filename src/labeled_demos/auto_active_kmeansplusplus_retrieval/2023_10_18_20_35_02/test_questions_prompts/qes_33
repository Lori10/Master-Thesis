  "test_question": "Q: An express electric train takes exact three seconds to enter tunnel which is 1 mile long.\nIf train is traveling at 120 mile an hour, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel ? Answer Choices: (A) 43 seconds (B) 39 seconds (C) 20 seconds (D) 33 seconds (E) 55 seconds",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A train 700 m long is running at a speed of 78 km/hr. If it crosses a tunnel in 1 min, then the length of the tunnel is? Answer Choices: (A) 298 m (B) 468 m (C) 600 m (D) 667 m (E) 781 m\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s. 78 km/hr = (78 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 21.67 m/s Next, we need to find the time taken by the train to cross the tunnel. We know that the length of the train is 700 m and it crosses the tunnel in 1 min (60 seconds). Therefore, the speed of the train relative to the tunnel is: Speed = Distance / Time Speed = (700 + Length of tunnel) / 60 Speed = (700 + Length of tunnel) / 60 Multiplying both sides by 60: Speed x 60 = 700 + Length of tunnel 21.67 x 60 = 700 + Length of tunnel 1300.2 - 700 = Length of tunnel Length of tunnel = 600.2 m Therefore, the length of the tunnel is approximately 600 m. The closest answer choice is (C) 600 m. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Calculate the time it will take for a train that is 120 meter long to pass a bridge of 160 meter length, if the speed of the train is 40 km/hour ? Answer Choices: (A) 21.2 seconds (B) 25.2 seconds (C) 29.2 seconds (D) 35.2 seconds (E) 11.2 seconds\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/hour to m/s. 40 km/hour = (40 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 11.11 m/s (approx) Now, we need to find the total distance that the train will cover while passing the bridge. Total distance = length of train + length of bridge = 120 + 160 = 280 meters Next, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed time = 280 / 11.11 = 25.21 seconds (approx) Therefore, the answer is (B) 25.2 seconds. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Two goods trains each 1250 m long are running in opposite directions on parallel tracks. Their speeds are 45 km/hr and 30 km/hr respectively. Find the time taken by the slower train to pass the driver of the faster one? Answer Choices: (A) 228 (B) 278 (C) 48 (D) 27 (E) 120\nA: Let's think step by step. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds, which is 45 + 30 = 75 km/hr. We need to convert this to meters per second, so we divide by 3.6: 75 km/hr \u00f7 3.6 = 20.83 m/s Now we can find the time taken by the slower train to pass the driver of the faster one. The total distance that the slower train needs to cover is the sum of the lengths of the two trains, which is 2 \u00d7 1250 = 2500 m. Using the formula distance = speed \u00d7 time, we can find the time taken: time = distance \u00f7 speed time = 2500 m \u00f7 20.83 m/s time \u2248 120 seconds Therefore, the answer is (E) 120. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A train running at the speed of 60 km/hr crosses a pole in 15 seconds. What is the length of the train? Answer Choices: (A) 187 m (B) 250 m (C) 876 m (D) 150 m (E) 267 m\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that the train crosses a pole in 15 seconds. This means that the length of the train plus the length of the front and back gaps (if any) is equal to the distance covered by the train in 15 seconds. We need to convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s, as the time given is in seconds and the answer choices are in meters. 60 km/hr = (60 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 16.67 m/s Let's assume that there are no front or back gaps. Distance covered by the train in 15 seconds = speed x time = 16.67 x 15 = 250.05 meters Therefore, the length of the train is 250 meters. The correct answer is (B) 250 m. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
