  "formatted_prompt": "Q: What is the value of: -9^7 + 9^9 ? Answer Choices: (A)  9^2 (B)  -18^16 (C)  63(9^7)  (D)  -80(9^7)  (E)  80(9^7) \nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to evaluate -9^7. This means we raise -9 to the 7th power, and then negate the result. So, -9^7 = -(9 x 9 x 9 x 9 x 9 x 9 x 9) = -4,782,969. Next, we need to evaluate 9^9. This means we raise 9 to the 9th power, which is 387,420,489. Finally, we add these two values together: -4,782,969 + 387,420,489 = 382,637,520. Therefore, the answer is (E) 80(9^7). The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: If the number 52,1n9, where n represents the tens digit, is a multiple of 3, then the value of n could be which of the following? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 5 (C) 3 (D) 1 (E) 0\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine if a number is a multiple of 3, we need to add up its digits and see if the sum is a multiple of 3. So, 52,1n9 = 5 + 2 + 1 + n + 9 = 17 + n. For 17 + n to be a multiple of 3, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3. The only answer choice that works is (A) 6, because 17 + 6 = 23, which is a multiple of 3 (since 2 + 3 = 5, which is not a multiple of 3). Therefore, the value of n could be 6. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: What is the value of 4^5+4^6? Answer Choices: (A)  5(4^5)  (B)  4^35 (C)  17(4^5)  (D)  8^12 (E)  7(4^5) \nA: Let's think step by step. We can simplify the expression by factoring out 4^5: 4^5 + 4^6 = 4^5(1 + 4) = 4^5(5) = 5(4^5) Therefore, the answer is (A) 5(4^5). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: what is the smallest number should be added to 5377 so that the sum is completely divisible by 7? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 4 (C) 6 (D) 2 (E) 1\nA: Let's think step by step. To make a number completely divisible by 7, we need to add the smallest number that will make the sum a multiple of 7. We can find this number by taking the remainder of the original number when divided by 7 and subtracting it from 7. So, let's find the remainder of 5377 when divided by 7: 5377 \u00f7 7 = 768 R 1 So, the remainder is 1. To make the sum completely divisible by 7, we need to add: 7 - 1 = 6 Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 6. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
