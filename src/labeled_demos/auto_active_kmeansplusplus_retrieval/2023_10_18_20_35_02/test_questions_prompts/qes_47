  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The Shopkeeper increased the price of a product by 25% so that customer finds it difficult to purchase the required amount. But somehow the customer managed to purchase only 70% of the required amount. What is the net difference in the expenditure on that product? Answer Choices: (A) 12.5% (B) 13% (C) 15% (D) 17% (E) 19%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the original price of the product was $100. After increasing the price by 25%, the new price becomes $125. Now, the customer only purchases 70% of the required amount. This means the customer only spends 70% of the amount they would have spent if they had purchased the required amount. So, the customer spends 70% of $125, which is $87.50. The net difference in expenditure can be calculated by finding the percentage decrease in expenditure. The original expenditure would have been 100% of $125, which is $125. The actual expenditure is $87.50. So, the percentage decrease in expenditure is: ((125 - 87.5)/125) x 100% = 30/125 x 100% = 24% Therefore, the net difference in expenditure is 24%. None of the answer choices match the calculated answer, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The output of a factory was increased by 10% to keep up with rising demand. To handle the holiday rush, this new output was increased by 25%. By approximately what percent would the output now have to be decreased in order to restore the original output? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 24% (C) 30% (D) 27% (E) 79%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the original output was 100 units. After the first increase of 10%, the new output became 110 units. After the second increase of 25%, the new output became 137.5 units (110 + 0.25*110). To restore the original output of 100 units, we need to decrease the current output of 137.5 units by a certain percentage. The percentage decrease can be calculated as follows: Percentage decrease = ((New value - Original value) / New value) * 100 = ((137.5 - 100) / 137.5) * 100 = 27.27% Therefore, the output now has to be decreased by approximately 27% to restore the original output. The closest answer choice is (D) 27%. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If the selling price is quadrupled,the profit is pentadruple, what is the percentage of profit?? Answer Choices: (A) 50% (B) 100% (C) 150% (D) 200% (E) 250%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the cost price of the item is $100. If the selling price is quadrupled, the new selling price would be $400. Let's say the profit made at the original selling price was $x. If the profit is pentadrupled, the new profit would be $5x. Profit = Selling price - Cost price So, x = Selling price - $100 $5x = $400 - $100 $5x = $300 x = $60 Therefore, the original profit was $60 and the new profit is $300. Percentage increase in profit = (New profit - Original profit) / Original profit * 100 = (300 - 60) / 60 * 100 = 400% So, the answer is (D) 200%. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: The price of an item is discounted 10 percent on day 1 of a sale. On day 2, the item is discounted another 10 percent, and on day 3, it is discounted an additional 20 percent. The price of the item on day 3 is what percentage of the sale price on day 1? Answer Choices: (A) 28% (B) 40% (C) 64.8% (D) 70% (E) 72%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the original price of the item is $100. On day 1, the item is discounted by 10%, so the sale price on day 1 is: $100 - (10% of $100) = $90 On day 2, the item is discounted by another 10%, so the sale price on day 2 is: $90 - (10% of $90) = $81 On day 3, the item is discounted by 20%, so the sale price on day 3 is: $81 - (20% of $81) = $64.8 Therefore, the price of the item on day 3 is $64.8, which is 64.8% of the sale price on day 1 ($90). So, the answer is (C) 64.8%. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
