  "test_question": "Q: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5(\u221a3 + 1)  (B) 6(\u221a3 + \u221a2)  (C) 7(\u221a3 \u2013 1)  (D) 8(\u221a3 \u2013 2)  (E) None of these",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The speed of a car increases by 2 kms after every one hour. If the distance travelling in the first one hour was 35 kms. what was the total distance travelled in 12 hours? Answer Choices: (A) 456 kms (B) 482 kms (C) 552 kms (D) 556 kms (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. After the first hour, the car would have travelled 35 + 2 = 37 kms. After the second hour, the car would have travelled 37 + 2 = 39 kms. Similarly, after the third hour, the car would have travelled 41 kms, after the fourth hour, it would have travelled 43 kms, and so on. So, after 12 hours, the car would have travelled a total distance of: 35 + 37 + 39 + ... + 47 + 49 = (12/2) * (35 + 49) = 12 * 42 = 504 kms Therefore, the correct answer is (E) None of these, as none of the given options match the calculated answer. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A driver covers a certain distance by car driving at 60 km/hr and returns back to the starting point riding on a scooter at 10 km/hr. What was the average speed for the whole journey? Answer Choices: (A) 14.2 km/h (B) 17.1 km/h (C) 19.3 km/h (D) 21.7 km/h (E) 23.5 km/h\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the distance covered by the driver is 'd' km. The time taken to cover the distance by car at 60 km/hr is given by: Time taken = Distance/Speed = d/60 The time taken to cover the same distance by scooter at 10 km/hr is given by: Time taken = Distance/Speed = d/10 The total time taken for the whole journey is the sum of the time taken for the onward journey and the time taken for the return journey. Total time taken = d/60 + d/10 = (d + 6d)/60 = 7d/60 The average speed for the whole journey is given by: Average speed = Total distance/Total time taken Total distance = 2d (since the driver covers the same distance twice) Average speed = 2d/(7d/60) = 120/7 km/hr Rounding off to one decimal place, we get the answer as (A) 14.2 km/h. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: What would happen in the previous question if both A and B had started at point P. Answer Choices: (A) 800 Km (B) 600 Km (C) 1000 Km (D) 350 Km (E) 250 Km\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that A travels at a speed of 50 km/h and B travels at a speed of 40 km/h. If they both started at point P, they would be moving in opposite directions. Let's say they meet after x hours. In that time, A would have traveled 50x km and B would have traveled 40x km. We also know that the distance between A and B is 600 km. So, we can set up the equation: 50x + 40x = 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 90x = 600 x = 6.67 hours Now that we know they meet after 6.67 hours, we can find out how far each of them has traveled: A: 50 km/h x 6.67 h = 333.33 km B: 40 km/h x 6.67 h = 266.67 km The total distance they have traveled is: 333.33 km + 266.67 km = 600 km Therefore, the answer is (B) 600 km. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: An object thrown directly upward is at a height of h feet after t seconds, where h = -15 (t-2)^2 + 150. At what height, in feet, is the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 90 (C) 124 (D) 132 (E) 140\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the maximum height of the object. We can do this by finding the vertex of the quadratic equation h = -15(t-2)^2 + 150. The vertex of a quadratic equation in the form of h = a(t-b)^2 + c is (b, c). In this case, the vertex is (2, 150). This means that the object reaches its maximum height of 150 feet after 2 seconds. Next, we need to find the height of the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height. We can do this by plugging in t = 4 (2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height) into the equation h = -15(t-2)^2 + 150. h = -15(4-2)^2 + 150 h = -15(2)^2 + 150 h = -60 + 150 h = 90 Therefore, the height of the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height is 90 feet. The correct answer is (B) 90. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
