  "test_question": "Q: A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted? Answer Choices: (A) 438 (B) 550 (C) 500 (D) 450 (E) 498",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: What is the ratio G of the surface area of a cube to the surface area of a rectangular solid identical to the cube in all ways except that its length has been doubled? Answer Choices: (A) 1/4 (B) 3/8 (C) 1/2 (D) 3/5 (E) 2\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. Let's assume that the cube has a side length of \"x\". Therefore, its surface area would be 6x^2 (since there are 6 faces, each with an area of x^2). Now, let's consider the rectangular solid that is identical to the cube in all ways except that its length has been doubled. This means that its dimensions are 2x, x, and x (since the width and height are the same as the cube). Therefore, its surface area would be: 2(2x)(x) + 2(2x)(x) + 2(x)(x) = 4x^2 + 4x^2 + 2x^2 = 10x^2 Now, we can find the ratio G of the surface area of the cube to the surface area of the rectangular solid by dividing the surface area of the cube by the surface area of the rectangular solid: G = (surface area of cube) / (surface area of rectangular solid) G = (6x^2) / (10x^2) G = 3/5 Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 3/5. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: The sides of a rectangular region measured to the nearest centimeter are 8 cm and 5 cm. Out of the following which is the largest possible value of actual area of rectangle ? Answer Choices: (A) 48 (B) 55.25 (C) 52.29 (D) 44 (E) 41.25\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that the actual length and width of the rectangle must be somewhere between 7.5 cm and 8.5 cm for the 8 cm measurement, and between 4.5 cm and 5.5 cm for the 5 cm measurement. To find the largest possible area, we want to use the largest possible length and width within these ranges. The largest possible length is 8.5 cm and the largest possible width is 5.5 cm. So, the largest possible area is 8.5 cm x 5.5 cm = 46.75 cm^2. Out of the given answer choices, the closest one to 46.75 is (D) 44. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 44. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Richard has to paint a mural with seven horizontal stripes. He only has enough paint for four red stripes, four blue stripes, four white stripes. If his patron wants at most two different colors in the mural, how many different ways can he paint the wall? Answer Choices: (A) 210 (B) 350 (C) 700 (D) 2,520 (E) 5,040\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to consider the case where Richard uses only one color. He can choose any of the three colors, so there are 3 ways to paint the mural with only one color. Next, we need to consider the case where Richard uses two colors. He can choose any two colors out of the three, which can be done in 3C2 = 3 ways. For each choice of colors, he can paint the mural in the following ways: - 2 stripes of one color, 5 stripes of the other color: 4C2 x 4C5 = 6 x 4 = 24 - 3 stripes of one color, 4 stripes of the other color: 4C3 x 4C4 = 4 x 1 = 4 So, there are 3 x (24 + 4) = 84 ways to paint the mural with two colors. Therefore, the total number of ways to paint the mural is 3 + 84 = 87. None of the above answer choices match our answer, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The area of a square is 4225 sq cm. Find the ratio of the breadth and the length of a rectangle whose length is twice the side of the square and breadth is 24 cm less than the side of the square. Answer Choices: (A) 5:28 (B) 5:19 (C) 5:12 (D) 5:13 (E) 41:130\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the side of the square. We know that the area of the square is 4225 sq cm, so we can find the side by taking the square root of the area: Side of square = \u221a4225 = 65 cm Next, we need to find the length and breadth of the rectangle. We are given that the length is twice the side of the square, so: Length of rectangle = 2 x 65 = 130 cm We are also given that the breadth is 24 cm less than the side of the square, so: Breadth of rectangle = 65 - 24 = 41 cm Now, we need to find the ratio of the breadth and the length of the rectangle. Ratio of breadth to length = 41:130 Simplifying this ratio by dividing both sides by 41, we get: 1:3.17 Multiplying both sides by 5 to get rid of the decimal, we get: 5:15.83 Rounding off to the nearest whole number, we get: 5:16 Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
