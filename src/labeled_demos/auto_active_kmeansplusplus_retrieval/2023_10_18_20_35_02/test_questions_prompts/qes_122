  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A trader bought a car at 20% discount on its original price. He sold it at a 40% increase on the price he bought it. What percent of profit did he make on the original price? Answer Choices: (A) 17% (B) 17% (C) 12% (D) 82% (E) 92%\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. Let's assume that the original price of the car was $100. The trader bought the car at a 20% discount, which means he paid 80% of the original price, i.e., $80. He then sold the car at a 40% increase on the price he bought it, which means he sold it for 140% of the price he bought it, i.e., $112. Now, let's calculate the profit he made on the original price. Profit = Selling price - Cost price Profit = $112 - $100 Profit = $12 Therefore, the profit he made on the original price was $12. To calculate the percentage profit, we need to divide the profit by the original price and multiply by 100. Percentage profit = (Profit / Original price) x 100 Percentage profit = ($12 / $100) x 100 Percentage profit = 12% Therefore, the trader made a profit of 12% on the original price. Hence, the correct answer is option (C) 12%. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The price of an item is discounted 10 percent on day 1 of a sale. On day 2, the item is discounted another 10 percent, and on day 3, it is discounted an additional 20 percent. The price of the item on day 3 is what percentage of the sale price on day 1? Answer Choices: (A) 28% (B) 40% (C) 64.8% (D) 70% (E) 72%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the original price of the item is $100. On day 1, the item is discounted by 10%, so the sale price on day 1 is: $100 - (10% of $100) = $90 On day 2, the item is discounted by another 10%, so the sale price on day 2 is: $90 - (10% of $90) = $81 On day 3, the item is discounted by 20%, so the sale price on day 3 is: $81 - (20% of $81) = $64.8 Therefore, the price of the item on day 3 is $64.8, which is 64.8% of the sale price on day 1 ($90). So, the answer is (C) 64.8%. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If on an item a company gives 25% discount, they earn 25% profit.If they now give 10% discount then what is the profit? Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 40 (C) 50 (D) 60 (E) 70\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the original price of the item is $100. With a 25% discount, the selling price becomes 75% of the original price, which is $75. Now, we know that the company earns a 25% profit on this selling price of $75. Profit = 25% of $75 = $18.75 So, the cost price of the item for the company is $75 - $18.75 = $56.25 If the company now gives a 10% discount, the selling price becomes 90% of $75, which is $67.50. The cost price for the company remains the same at $56.25. Profit = Selling price - Cost price = $67.50 - $56.25 = $11.25 Therefore, the profit is $11.25. The correct answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the calculated profit. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The Shopkeeper increased the price of a product by 25% so that customer finds it difficult to purchase the required amount. But somehow the customer managed to purchase only 70% of the required amount. What is the net difference in the expenditure on that product? Answer Choices: (A) 12.5% (B) 13% (C) 15% (D) 17% (E) 19%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the original price of the product was $100. After increasing the price by 25%, the new price becomes $125. Now, the customer only purchases 70% of the required amount. This means the customer only spends 70% of the amount they would have spent if they had purchased the required amount. So, the customer spends 70% of $125, which is $87.50. The net difference in expenditure can be calculated by finding the percentage decrease in expenditure. The original expenditure would have been 100% of $125, which is $125. The actual expenditure is $87.50. So, the percentage decrease in expenditure is: ((125 - 87.5)/125) x 100% = 30/125 x 100% = 24% Therefore, the net difference in expenditure is 24%. None of the answer choices match the calculated answer, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
