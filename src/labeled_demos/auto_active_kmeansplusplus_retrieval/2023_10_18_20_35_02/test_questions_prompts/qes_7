  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If the ratio of a to b is 2 to 3 and the ratio of b to c is 1 to 5, what is the ratio of a to c? Answer Choices: (A) 4/15 (B) 1/3 (C) 2/15 (D) 4/5 (E) 7/6\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find a common term between a, b, and c. We can do this by using the ratio of b to c, which is 1 to 5. We can multiply both sides by 3 to get the ratio of b to c in terms of b and a common term: b:c = 1:5 3b:15c = 1:5 b:5c = 1/3 Now we can use the ratio of a to b, which is 2 to 3, to express a in terms of b: a:b = 2:3 2b:3b = 2:3 a:b = 2/3 We can substitute this expression for a/b into the previous equation to get the ratio of a to c: a:b = 2/3 b:5c = 1/3 a:5c = (2/3)*(1/3) = 2/9 Therefore, the answer is (C) 2/15. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: What number has a 5:1 ratio to the number 10? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 50 (C) 99 (D) 72 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. The ratio of two numbers is the quotient of the two numbers. Here, we are given that the ratio of the unknown number to 10 is 5:1. So, we can set up the equation: x/10 = 5/1 where x is the unknown number. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: x = 10 * 5 x = 50 Therefore, the number that has a 5:1 ratio to the number 10 is 50. The correct answer is (B) 50. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If two numbers are in the ratio 1:2. If 10 is added to both of the numbers then the ratio becomes 2:3 then find the smallest number? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 20 (C) 30 (D) 40 (E) 50\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the two numbers be x and 2x (since they are in the ratio 1:2). When 10 is added to both numbers, the new numbers become x+10 and 2x+10. The new ratio is 2:3, so we can set up the equation: (x+10)/(2x+10) = 2/3 Cross-multiplying gives us: 3(x+10) = 2(2x+10) Simplifying: 3x + 30 = 4x + 20 x = 10 Therefore, the smallest number is x = 10. The answer is (A) 10. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Dividing by 3\u20446 and then multiplying by 5\u20446 is the same as dividing by what number? Answer Choices: (A) 31\u20445 (B) 16\u20445 (C) 20\u20449 (D) 9\u204420 (E) 5\u20443\nA: Let's think step by step. Dividing by 3/6 is the same as multiplying by 6/3, which simplifies to 2. So, we have: (dividing by 3/6) x (multiplying by 5/6) = (multiplying by 6/3) x (5/6) = 2 x 5/3 = 10/3 Therefore, the answer is (E) 5/3. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
