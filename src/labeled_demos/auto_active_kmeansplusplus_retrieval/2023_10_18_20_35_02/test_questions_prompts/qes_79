  "test_question": "Q: A point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan. What is the distance traveled, in centimeters, by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minutes? Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The diameter of the driving wheel of a bus is 120 m. How many revolution, per minute must the wheel make in order to keep a speed of 60 kmph approximately Answer Choices: (A) 245 (B) 257 (C) 262 (D) 265 (E) 275\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed from km/h to m/min. 60 km/h = 60,000 m/h = 1,000 m/min Next, we need to find the circumference of the wheel using the formula: Circumference = \u03c0 \u00d7 diameter Circumference = \u03c0 \u00d7 120 m Circumference \u2248 376.99 m Finally, we can use the formula: Speed = circumference \u00d7 revolutions per minute 1,000 m/min = 376.99 m \u00d7 revolutions per minute Revolutions per minute \u2248 2.65 Therefore, the answer is (D) 265. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: At 30 minutes past 4 O'clock, what is the angle between the two hands? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) I8 (C) 99 (D) 17 (E) 181\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, which is 30 degrees per hour. At 4:30, the hour hand has moved 4.5 hours * 30 degrees per hour = 135 degrees. The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, which is 6 degrees per minute. At 30 minutes past the hour, the minute hand has moved 30 minutes * 6 degrees per minute = 180 degrees. The angle between the two hands is the absolute difference between their positions. In this case, it is |135 - 180| = 45 degrees. None of the answer choices given match 45 degrees, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: If a man can cover 12 metres in one second, how many kilometres can he cover in 3 hours 45 minutes? Answer Choices: (A) 288 (B) 162 (C) 878 (D) 168 (E) 122\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 3 hours 45 minutes into seconds. 3 hours = 3 x 60 x 60 = 10,800 seconds 45 minutes = 45 x 60 = 2,700 seconds Total time = 10,800 + 2,700 = 13,500 seconds Now, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time The man's speed is 12 metres per second. So, distance covered in 13,500 seconds = 12 x 13,500 = 162,000 metres We need to convert this to kilometres: 1 kilometre = 1000 metres So, distance covered in 3 hours 45 minutes = 162,000/1000 = 162 kilometres Therefore, the answer is (B) 162. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If a truck is traveling at a constant rate of 54 kilometers per hour, how many seconds will it take the truck to travel a distance of 600 meters? (1 kilometer = 1000 meters) Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 24 (C) 30 (D) 36 (E) 40\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the truck from kilometers per hour to meters per second since the distance given is in meters. 54 kilometers per hour = 54,000 meters per hour (since 1 kilometer = 1000 meters) = 15 meters per second (since 1 hour = 3600 seconds) Now, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time Plugging in the values we have: 600 meters = 15 meters per second x time Solving for time: time = 600 meters / 15 meters per second time = 40 seconds Therefore, the answer is (E) 40. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
