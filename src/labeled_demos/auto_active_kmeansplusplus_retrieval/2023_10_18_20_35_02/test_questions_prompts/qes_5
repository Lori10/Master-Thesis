  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The speed of a train is 94 kmph. What is the distance covered by it in 12 minutes? Answer Choices: (A) 15 kmph (B) 11 kmph (C) 88 kmph (D) 19 kmph (E) 12 kmph\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that the speed of the train is 94 kmph. To find the distance covered in 12 minutes, we need to convert 12 minutes to hours. 1 hour = 60 minutes So, 12 minutes = 12/60 = 0.2 hours Now, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time Distance = 94 kmph x 0.2 hours Distance = 18.8 km Therefore, the distance covered by the train in 12 minutes is 18.8 km. The answer is not listed in the options. None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A man complete a journey in 10 hours. He travels first half of the journey at the rate of 20 km/hr and second half at the rate of 20 km/hr. Find the total journey in km. Answer Choices: (A) 220 km (B) 224 km (C) 230 km (D) 232 km (E) 200 km\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the total distance be 'd' km. The man travels the first half of the journey at a speed of 20 km/hr. Therefore, he covers the first half of the distance in d/2 * 20 = 10d/2 = 5d hours. Similarly, he covers the second half of the journey at a speed of 20 km/hr. Therefore, he covers the second half of the distance in d/2 * 20 = 10d/2 = 5d hours. Since the total time taken for the journey is 10 hours, we can write the equation: 5d/20 + 5d/20 = 10 Simplifying this equation, we get: d = 200 km Therefore, the total journey is 200 km. Hence, the correct answer is (E) 200 km. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: The speed of a car increases by 2 kms after every one hour. If the distance travelling in the first one hour was 35 kms. what was the total distance travelled in 12 hours? Answer Choices: (A) 456 kms (B) 482 kms (C) 552 kms (D) 556 kms (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. After the first hour, the car would have travelled 35 + 2 = 37 kms. After the second hour, the car would have travelled 37 + 2 = 39 kms. Similarly, after the third hour, the car would have travelled 41 kms, after the fourth hour, it would have travelled 43 kms, and so on. So, after 12 hours, the car would have travelled a total distance of: 35 + 37 + 39 + ... + 47 + 49 = (12/2) * (35 + 49) = 12 * 42 = 504 kms Therefore, the correct answer is (E) None of these, as none of the given options match the calculated answer. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Two stations A and B are 110 km apart on a straight line. One train starts from A at 7 a.m. and travels towards B at 20 kmph. Another train starts from B at 8 a.m. and travels towards A at a speed of 25 kmph. At what time will they meet? Answer Choices: (A) 39 (B) 10 (C) 88 (D) 12 (E) 18\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much distance the first train covers before the second train starts. The first train starts at 7 a.m. and the second train starts at 8 a.m., which means the first train has a one-hour head start. In one hour, the first train covers a distance of 20 km. Now, let's assume that the two trains meet after t hours. In that case, the second train would have traveled for t - 1 hours. Let's use the formula: distance = speed x time Distance covered by the first train + Distance covered by the second train = Total distance between the two stations 20t + 25(t-1) = 110 Simplifying the equation, we get: 45t = 135 t = 3 Therefore, the two trains will meet after 3 hours. The first train started at 7 a.m., so it will meet the second train at 10 a.m. Hence, the correct answer is (B) 10. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
