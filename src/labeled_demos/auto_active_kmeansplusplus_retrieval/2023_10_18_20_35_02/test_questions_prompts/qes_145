  "formatted_prompt": "Q: 1/0.025 is equal to Answer Choices: (A) 25.5 (B) 2.5 (C) 40 (D) .25 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. We can simplify 1/0.025 by dividing 1 by 0.025. 1 \u00f7 0.025 = 40 Therefore, the answer is (C) 40. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If 288 is divided into four parts proportional to 5, 7, 4, 8 then the smallest part is : Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 44 (C) 20 (D) 48 (E) 42\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total proportion: 5 + 7 + 4 + 8 = 24 Next, we need to find the proportion of each part: 5/24, 7/24, 4/24, 8/24 Simplifying these fractions, we get: 5/24, 7/24, 1/6, 1/3 Now, we can find the value of each part by multiplying its proportion by the total value: 5/24 x 288 = 60 7/24 x 288 = 84 1/6 x 288 = 48 1/3 x 288 = 96 Therefore, the smallest part is 48, which corresponds to the proportion of 1/6. The correct answer is (D) 48. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: 54.327 \u00d7 357.2 \u00d7 0.0057 is the same as : Answer Choices: (A) 5.4327 \u00d7 3.572 \u00d7 5.7 (B) 5.4327 \u00d7 3.572 \u00d7 0.57 (C) 5.4327 \u00d7 3.572 \u00d7 0.0000057 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can multiply 54.327 and 357.2 to get 19416.8104. Then, we can multiply that result by 0.0057 to get 110.8345248. Therefore, the answer is (C) 5.4327 \u00d7 3.572 \u00d7 0.0000057. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Dividing by 3\u20446 and then multiplying by 5\u20446 is the same as dividing by what number? Answer Choices: (A) 31\u20445 (B) 16\u20445 (C) 20\u20449 (D) 9\u204420 (E) 5\u20443\nA: Let's think step by step. Dividing by 3/6 is the same as multiplying by 6/3, which simplifies to 2. So, we have: (dividing by 3/6) x (multiplying by 5/6) = (multiplying by 6/3) x (5/6) = 2 x 5/3 = 10/3 Therefore, the answer is (E) 5/3. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
