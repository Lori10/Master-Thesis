  "test_question": "Q: At Daifu university, 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. If 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, what percentage of all Daifu students are members of the swim team? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 30% (C) 40% (D) 50% (E) 60%",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In a class, 30% of the students speaks truth, 20% speaks lie and 10% speaks both. If a student is selected at random, what is the probability that he has speak truth or lie? Answer Choices: (A) 1/4 (B) 2/3 (C) 3/5 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the percentage of students who speak either truth or lie. Percentage of students who speak truth = 30% Percentage of students who speak lie = 20% However, we need to subtract the percentage of students who speak both truth and lie, as they have been counted twice. Percentage of students who speak both truth and lie = 10% Therefore, the percentage of students who speak either truth or lie = 30% + 20% - 10% = 40%. So, the probability that a student selected at random speaks truth or lie is 40%. Answer: None of the above (as none of the answer choices match 40%). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: In a club with 310 peopl, 138 play tennis, 255 play baseball, and 94 people play both sports. How many people do not pla a sport? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 8 (C) 4 (D) 10 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 138 people play tennis, 255 people play baseball, and 94 people play both sports. To find the number of people who play only tennis, we can subtract the number of people who play both sports from the number of people who play tennis: 138 - 94 = 44 Similarly, to find the number of people who play only baseball, we can subtract the number of people who play both sports from the number of people who play baseball: 255 - 94 = 161 Now, to find the number of people who do not play a sport, we need to subtract the total number of people who play a sport from the total number of people in the club: 310 - (44 + 161 + 94) = 11 Therefore, the answer is (E) 11. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: There are 600 boys in a hostel. Each plays either hockey or football or both. If 75% play hockey and 45% play football, how many play both? Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 150 (C) 200 (D) 180 (E) 160\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 75% of the boys play hockey, which means 0.75 x 600 = 450 boys play hockey. Similarly, 45% of the boys play football, which means 0.45 x 600 = 270 boys play football. Now, we need to find out how many boys play both hockey and football. Let's assume that x boys play both. We know that the total number of boys who play either hockey or football is 600. So, we can write an equation: Number of boys who play hockey + Number of boys who play football - Number of boys who play both = Total number of boys 450 + 270 - x = 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 720 - x = 600 x = 120 Therefore, 120 boys play both hockey and football. The correct answer is (A) 120. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A club with a total membership of 25 has formed 3 committees, M, S and R, which have 8, 12 and 5 members respectively. If no members of committee M is on either of the other 2 committees, what is the greatest possible number of members in the club who are on none of the committees? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 7 (C) 8 (D) 10 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of members who are on the committees. M has 8 members, S has 12 members, and R has 5 members. Since no members of M are on either of the other 2 committees, we can subtract the 8 members of M from the total number of committee members: Total committee members = 8 + 12 + 5 - 8 = 17 So, there are 17 members on the committees. To find the greatest possible number of members who are on none of the committees, we need to subtract this number from the total membership of the club: Greatest possible number of members not on committees = 25 - 17 = 8 Therefore, the answer is (C) 8. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
