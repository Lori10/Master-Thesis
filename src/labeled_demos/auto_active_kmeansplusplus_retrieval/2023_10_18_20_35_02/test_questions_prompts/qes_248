If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator? Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: An elevator starts with 5 pasengers and stops at 8 different floors of the house. Find out the probability of all the 5 passengers alighting at different floors. Answer Choices: (A) 90 / 512 (B) 105 / 512 (C) 15/512 (D) 30/512 (E) 48/512\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 8 floors and 5 passengers, so the first passenger has 8 choices of floors to get off at. The second passenger has 7 choices of floors left, the third passenger has 6 choices, the fourth passenger has 5 choices, and the last passenger has 4 choices. Therefore, the total number of ways that the passengers can get off at different floors is: 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 = 6,720 Now, we need to find the total number of ways that the passengers can get off at any floor. This is simply: 8^5 = 32,768 So, the probability of all the passengers getting off at different floors is: 6,720 / 32,768 = 105 / 512 Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 105 / 512. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Two trains of equal lengths take 10 sec and 15 sec respectively to cross a telegraph post. If the length of each train be 120 m, in what time will they cross other travelling in opposite direction? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 12 (C) 13 (D) 14 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. The total distance covered by both trains when they cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is 240 meters. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds, since they are travelling in opposite directions. Let's call this speed \"v\". We know that the first train takes 10 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/10 = 12 m/s. Similarly, the second train takes 15 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/15 = 8 m/s. Therefore, the relative speed of the two trains is v = 12 + 8 = 20 m/s. To find the time it takes for the two trains to cross each other, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed Plugging in the values we know, we get: time = 240 / 20 = 12 seconds Therefore, the answer is (B) 12. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A 300 meter long train crosses a platform in 45 seconds while it crosses a signal pole in 18 seconds. What is the length of the platform? Answer Choices: (A) 99 (B) 450 (C) 350 (D) 882 (E) 281\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the speed of the train. Speed = Distance/Time Speed of train = 300/18 = 16.67 m/s Now, we can use this speed to find the length of the platform. Let the length of the platform be x meters. Total distance covered by the train while crossing the platform = 300 + x Total time taken by the train to cover this distance = 45 seconds Speed of train = (300 + x)/45 (300 + x)/45 = 16.67 300 + x = 750.15 x = 450.15 Therefore, the length of the platform is approximately 450 meters. The correct answer is (B) 450. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: The speed of a train is 94 kmph. What is the distance covered by it in 12 minutes? Answer Choices: (A) 15 kmph (B) 11 kmph (C) 88 kmph (D) 19 kmph (E) 12 kmph\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that the speed of the train is 94 kmph. To find the distance covered in 12 minutes, we need to convert 12 minutes to hours. 1 hour = 60 minutes So, 12 minutes = 12/60 = 0.2 hours Now, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time Distance = 94 kmph x 0.2 hours Distance = 18.8 km Therefore, the distance covered by the train in 12 minutes is 18.8 km. The answer is not listed in the options. None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
