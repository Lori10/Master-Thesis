  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The area of a square is 4225 sq cm. Find the ratio of the breadth and the length of a rectangle whose length is twice the side of the square and breadth is 24 cm less than the side of the square. Answer Choices: (A) 5:28 (B) 5:19 (C) 5:12 (D) 5:13 (E) 41:130\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the side of the square. We know that the area of the square is 4225 sq cm, so we can find the side by taking the square root of the area: Side of square = \u221a4225 = 65 cm Next, we need to find the length and breadth of the rectangle. We are given that the length is twice the side of the square, so: Length of rectangle = 2 x 65 = 130 cm We are also given that the breadth is 24 cm less than the side of the square, so: Breadth of rectangle = 65 - 24 = 41 cm Now, we need to find the ratio of the breadth and the length of the rectangle. Ratio of breadth to length = 41:130 Simplifying this ratio by dividing both sides by 41, we get: 1:3.17 Multiplying both sides by 5 to get rid of the decimal, we get: 5:15.83 Rounding off to the nearest whole number, we get: 5:16 Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A wire in the form of a circle of radius 3.5 m is bent in the form of a rectangule, whose length and breadth are in the ratio of 6 : 5. What is the area of the rectangle? Answer Choices: (A) 70 cm2 (B) 30 cm2 (C) 66 cm2 (D) 55 cm2 (E) 54 cm2\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length and breadth of the rectangle. Let the length be 6x and the breadth be 5x. The perimeter of the circle is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle. Perimeter of circle = 2\u03c0r = 2\u03c0(3.5) = 7\u03c0 Perimeter of rectangle = 2(6x + 5x) = 22x So, 22x = 7\u03c0 x = 7\u03c0/22 Now, length = 6x = 6(7\u03c0/22) = 21\u03c0/11 Breadth = 5x = 5(7\u03c0/22) = 35\u03c0/22 Area of rectangle = length x breadth = (21\u03c0/11) x (35\u03c0/22) = 735\u03c0^2/242 This is approximately equal to 76.2 m^2. None of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: The sides of a rectangular region measured to the nearest centimeter are 8 cm and 5 cm. Out of the following which is the largest possible value of actual area of rectangle ? Answer Choices: (A) 48 (B) 55.25 (C) 52.29 (D) 44 (E) 41.25\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that the actual length and width of the rectangle must be somewhere between 7.5 cm and 8.5 cm for the 8 cm measurement, and between 4.5 cm and 5.5 cm for the 5 cm measurement. To find the largest possible area, we want to use the largest possible length and width within these ranges. The largest possible length is 8.5 cm and the largest possible width is 5.5 cm. So, the largest possible area is 8.5 cm x 5.5 cm = 46.75 cm^2. Out of the given answer choices, the closest one to 46.75 is (D) 44. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 44. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A rectangular plot measuring 90 metres by 50 metres is to be enclosed by wire fencing. If the poles of the fence are kept 5 metres apart, how many poles will be needed ? Answer Choices: (A) 55 (B) 56 (C) 57 (D) 58 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular plot. Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 2(90 + 50) = 280 meters Next, we need to find the number of poles required if they are kept 5 meters apart. We can divide the perimeter by the distance between two poles: Number of poles = Perimeter / Distance between two poles Number of poles = 280 / 5 = 56 Therefore, the answer is (B) 56. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
