  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Using all the letters of the word \"NOKIA\", how many words can be formed, which begin with N and end with A? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 24 (C) 62 (D) 78 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to choose the first letter as N, which leaves us with four letters: O, K, I, and A. Next, we need to arrange these four letters in different ways to form words. This can be done in 4! = 24 ways. Finally, we need to ensure that each word ends with A. Out of the four remaining letters, only one is A. Therefore, there is only one way to choose the last letter. So, the total number of words that can be formed is 24 x 1 = 24. Therefore, the answer is (B) 24. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: How many 4-digit Q numbers (ABCD) can be formed such that |A \u2013 D| = 2? Answer Choices: (A) 2,000 (B) 1,900 (C) 1,800 (D) 1,600 (E) 1,500\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that |A \u2013 D| = 2. This means that A and D are either 2 digits apart or 2 digits away from each other in the number line. Case 1: A is 2 digits greater than D. In this case, we can choose any digit from 1 to 9 for D (since it's a 4-digit number, we can't have 0 as the first digit). Then, A can be any digit that is 2 greater than D, except for 9 (since we can't have a 5th digit). So, there are 8 choices for A. Case 2: D is 2 digits greater than A. This is the same as Case 1, but with A and D switched. So, there are also 8 choices for A in this case. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit Q numbers that can be formed is 8 + 8 = 16. The answer is (D) 1,600. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Jamboree and GMAT Club Contest Starts\nQUESTION #20:\nHow many words (with or without meaning) can be formed using all the letters of the word \u201cSELFIE\u201d so that the two E\u2019s are not together? Answer Choices: (A)  660 (B)  600 (C)  500 (D)  300 (E)  240\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of ways to arrange all the letters of the word \"SELFIE\". This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken all at a time, which is n!. In this case, n = 6, so the total number of arrangements is 6! = 720. Next, we need to subtract the number of arrangements where the two E's are together. To do this, we can treat the two E's as a single object and find the number of arrangements of the five objects \"S\", \"L\", \"F\", \"I\", and \"EE\". This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is nPr = n!/(n-r)!. In this case, n = 5 and r = 5, so the number of arrangements where the two E's are together is 5! = 120. Finally, we can subtract the number of arrangements where the two E's are together from the total number of arrangements to get the number of arrangements where the two E's are not together: 720 - 120 = 600. Therefore, the answer is (B) 600. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: How many different 5 letter combinations can be created from the letters A,B,C,D and E? Answer Choices: (A) 625 (B) 125 (C) 3125 (D) 25 (E) 5\nA: Let's think step by step. We have 5 letters and we need to choose 5 of them to form a combination. This is a permutation problem, where order matters. The formula for permutation is nPr = n!/(n-r)!, where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items we need to choose. In this case, n = 5 and r = 5. So, the number of permutations is 5P5 = 5!/(5-5)! = 5!/0! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120. However, the problem asks for combinations, where order doesn't matter. The formula for combination is nCr = n!/r!(n-r)!. In this case, n = 5 and r = 5. So, the number of combinations is 5C5 = 5!/5!(5-5)! = 5!/5!0! = 1. Therefore, the answer is (D) 25. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
