  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A drink vendor has 60 liters of Maaza, 144 liters of Pepsi and 368 liters of Sprite. He wants to pack them in cans, so that each can contains the same number of liters of a drink, and doesn't want to mix any two drinks in a can. What is the least number of cans required? Answer Choices: (A) 135 (B) 137 (C) 143 (D) 310 (E) 380\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 60, 144, and 368 to determine the maximum number of liters that can be packed in a can. The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. The prime factorization of 144 is 2^4 * 3^2. The prime factorization of 368 is 2^4 * 23. The GCD of these three numbers is 12 (2^2 * 3). Therefore, each can can contain a maximum of 12 liters of a drink. To find the least number of cans required, we need to divide each quantity by 12 and round up to the nearest integer. 60/12 = 5 144/12 = 12 368/12 = 31 So we need at least 5 cans of Maaza, 12 cans of Pepsi, and 31 cans of Sprite. The total number of cans required is 5 + 12 + 31 = 48. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Jill has 21 gallons of water stored in quart, half-gallon, and one gallon jars. She has equal numbers of each size jar holding the liquid. What is the total number of water filled jars? Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 6 (C) 9 (D) 36 (E) 14\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert all the jars to the same unit, either quarts, half-gallons, or gallons. Let's convert everything to quarts since it's the smallest unit. One gallon is equal to 4 quarts, so Jill has 21 x 4 = 84 quarts of water. Let's say she has x jars of each size. Each quart jar contains 1 quart of water, each half-gallon jar contains 2 quarts of water, and each gallon jar contains 4 quarts of water. So we can set up the equation: 1x + 2x + 4x = 84 7x = 84 x = 12 Therefore, Jill has 12 jars of each size, for a total of 3 x 12 = 36 jars. The answer is (D) 36. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Two taps can separately fill a cistern 10 minutes and 15 minutes respectively and when the waste pipe is open, they can together fill it in 18 minutes. The waste pipe can empty the full cistern in? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 6 (C) 7 (D) 9 (E) 1\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the capacity of the cistern be C. The rate of filling of the first tap is C/10 per minute. The rate of filling of the second tap is C/15 per minute. When both taps are open, their combined rate of filling is C/18 per minute. Let the rate of emptying of the waste pipe be W (in terms of the capacity of the cistern per minute). According to the problem, when all three are open, the net rate of filling is zero (since the waste pipe is emptying the cistern at the same time). So, we can write the equation: C/10 + C/15 - C/18 = W Multiplying through by the LCM of the denominators (which is 90), we get: 9C + 6C - 5C = 90W Simplifying, we get: 10C = 90W Dividing by 10, we get: C = 9W This means that the waste pipe can empty the full cistern in 9 minutes (since it empties 1/9th of the cistern per minute). Therefore, the answer is (D) 9. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A cistern is normally filled in 4 hrs,but takes 2 hrs longer to fill because of a leak on its bottom,if Cistern is full ,how much time citern would empty? Answer Choices: (A) 10 hours (B) 20 hours (C) 30 hours (D) 40 hours (E) 12 hours\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the cistern's capacity is 1 unit (it could be any unit of measurement). If there was no leak, the cistern would be filled in 4 hours. So, the rate of filling would be 1/4 units per hour. But because of the leak, it takes 2 hours longer to fill the cistern. So, the new time taken to fill the cistern is 4 + 2 = 6 hours. Let's assume that the leak can empty the cistern in x hours. Now, we can set up an equation based on the principle that the amount of water filled in the cistern is equal to the amount of water emptied by the leak when the cistern is full. Amount of water filled = Amount of water emptied Rate of filling x Time taken to fill = Rate of emptying x Time taken to empty 1 = (1/4) x 6 + (1/x) x t where t is the time taken to empty the cistern when it is full. Simplifying the equation, we get: 1 = (3/2) + (t/x) (t/x) = 1/2 t = (x/2) So, the time taken to empty the cistern when it is full is half the time taken by the leak to empty it. Since we don't know the time taken by the leak to empty the cistern, we cannot determine the exact answer. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
