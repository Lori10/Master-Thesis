The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck? Answer Choices: (A) 40.8 (B) 41.6 (C) 42.2 (D) 43.5 (E) 44.8",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The average weight of a group of boys is 30 kg. After a boy of weight 39 kg joins the group, the average weight of the group goes up by 1 kg. Find the number of boys in the group originally ? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 5 (D) 2 (E) 9\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the original number of boys in the group be x and their total weight be y. According to the problem, the average weight of the group of boys is 30 kg. Therefore, we can write: y/x = 30 After a boy of weight 39 kg joins the group, the average weight of the group goes up by 1 kg. This means that the new average weight is 31 kg. Therefore, we can write: (y + 39)/(x + 1) = 31 Now we have two equations with two variables. We can solve for x by using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution: y/x = 30 y = 30x Substitute y = 30x into the second equation: (30x + 39)/(x + 1) = 31 Simplify: 30x + 39 = 31(x + 1) 30x + 39 = 31x + 31 x = 8 Therefore, the original number of boys in the group is 8. The answer is (B) 8. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: The average of 6 numbers is 6.8. If one of the numbers is multiplied by a factor of 3, the average of the numbers increases to 9.2. What number is multiplied by 3? Answer Choices: (A)  9.5 (B)  8.0 (C)  7.2 (D)  5.0 (E)  4.0\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that the average of 6 numbers is 6.8. Therefore, the sum of the 6 numbers is 6.8 x 6 = 40.8. Step 2: Let's assume that the number that is multiplied by 3 is x. Therefore, the sum of the 6 numbers after this multiplication is 40.8 + 2x (since we are adding x and 2x to the sum of the original 6 numbers). Step 3: We also know that the new average is 9.2. Therefore, the sum of the 6 numbers after the multiplication is 9.2 x 6 = 55.2. Step 4: Equating the two sums from Step 2 and Step 3, we get: 40.8 + 2x = 55.2 Step 5: Solving for x, we get: 2x = 14.4 x = 7.2 Therefore, the number that is multiplied by 3 is 7.2. Answer: (C) 7.2 The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The average of 10 numbers was calculated as 20. It is discovered later on that while calculating the average, one number, namely 86, was incorrectly read as 26. What is the correct average? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 23 (C) 24 (D) 25 (E) 26\nA: Let's think step by step. The sum of the 10 numbers is 10 x 20 = 200 (since the average is 20). If 86 was incorrectly read as 26, then the sum of the 10 numbers should have been 200 - 26 + 86 = 260. Therefore, the correct average is 260/10 = 26. So, the answer is (E) 26. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: You have been given a physical balance and 7 weights of 43, 45, 30, 33, 28, 37 and 55 kgs. Keeping weights on one pan and object on the other, what is the maximum you can weigh less than 145 kgs. Answer Choices: (A) 145 (B) 143 (C) 147 (D) 141 (E) 142\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the combination of weights that adds up to the maximum weight less than 145 kgs. Starting with the heaviest weight, we can add 55 kgs to the pan. Next, we can add 45 kgs to the same pan, bringing the total weight to 100 kgs. Adding the next heaviest weight, 43 kgs, would bring the total weight to 143 kgs, which is less than 145 kgs. Therefore, the maximum weight we can weigh less than 145 kgs is 143 kgs. The correct answer is (B) 143. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
