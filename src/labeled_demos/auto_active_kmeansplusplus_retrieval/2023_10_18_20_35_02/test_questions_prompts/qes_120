  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A bookseller sells his books at a 25% markup in price. If he sells a book for $12.5, how much did he pay for it? Answer Choices: (A) $14.40 (B) $14.00 (C) $11.00 (D) $9.60 (E) $10.00\nA: Let's think step by step. The bookseller sells his books at a 25% markup in price, which means he sells the book for 125% of its original price. Let's assume the original price of the book is x. Then, the selling price of the book is 1.25x. We know that the selling price of the book is $12.5. So, 1.25x = $12.5 Solving for x, we get x = $10. Therefore, the bookseller paid $10 for the book. The correct answer is (E) $10.00. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: If on an item a company gives 25% discount, they earn 25% profit.If they now give 10% discount then what is the profit? Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 40 (C) 50 (D) 60 (E) 70\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the original price of the item is $100. With a 25% discount, the selling price becomes 75% of the original price, which is $75. Now, we know that the company earns a 25% profit on this selling price of $75. Profit = 25% of $75 = $18.75 So, the cost price of the item for the company is $75 - $18.75 = $56.25 If the company now gives a 10% discount, the selling price becomes 90% of $75, which is $67.50. The cost price for the company remains the same at $56.25. Profit = Selling price - Cost price = $67.50 - $56.25 = $11.25 Therefore, the profit is $11.25. The correct answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the calculated profit. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A man sells an article at a gain 15%. If he had bought it at 10% less and sold it for 6 less, he would have gained 25%. Find the cost price of the article. Answer Choices: (A) 150 (B) 160 (C) 170 (D) 180 (E) 240\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the cost price of the article be x. According to the question, he sells the article at a gain of 15%, so the selling price would be 1.15x. Now, if he had bought it at 10% less, the cost price would be 0.9x. And if he had sold it for 6 less, the selling price would be 1.15x - 6. According to the question, if he had done this, he would have gained 25%. So, we can write: 1.15x - (1.15x - 6) = 0.25(0.9x) Simplifying this equation, we get: 6 = 0.025x x = 240 Therefore, the cost price of the article is 240. The correct answer is (E) 240. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Rahim bought 65 books for Rs.1150 from one shop and 50 books for Rs.920 from another. What is the average price he paid per book ? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 18 (C) 99 (D) 787 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total cost of all the books Rahim bought. Total cost = Rs.1150 + Rs.920 = Rs.2070 Next, we need to find the total number of books Rahim bought. Total number of books = 65 + 50 = 115 Finally, we can find the average price per book by dividing the total cost by the total number of books. Average price per book = Total cost / Total number of books Average price per book = Rs.2070 / 115 Average price per book = Rs.18 Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 18. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
