  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The length of each side of an equilateral triangle having an area of 4\u221a3 cm2 is? Answer Choices: (A) 3:4 (B) 3:9 (C) 3:7 (D) 3:1 (E) 3:2\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that the area of an equilateral triangle is given by the formula A = (\u221a3/4) * s^2, where s is the length of each side. We are given that the area is 4\u221a3 cm^2, so we can set up the equation: 4\u221a3 = (\u221a3/4) * s^2 Simplifying, we get: 16 = s^2 Taking the square root of both sides, we get: s = 4 Therefore, the length of each side of the equilateral triangle is 4 cm. None of the above answer choices are correct. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The difference between a positive proper fraction and its reciprocal is 9/20. The fraction is? Answer Choices: (A) 4/5 (B) 4/7 (C) 5 (D) 5/7 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the fraction be x/y. According to the problem, x/y - y/x = 9/20 Multiplying both sides by xy, we get x^2 - y^2 = 9xy/20 Simplifying, 20x^2 - 20y^2 = 9xy 20x^2 - 9xy - 20y^2 = 0 We can factor this as (4x - 5y)(5x + 4y) = 0 So either 4x - 5y = 0 or 5x + 4y = 0. If 4x - 5y = 0, then x/y = 5/4. If 5x + 4y = 0, then x/y = -4/5, but this is not a positive proper fraction. Therefore, the answer is (A) 4/5. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A numberais squared and then multiplied by negative 3. The result of this operation T is equal to three times the sum of three timesaand two. What is one possible value ofa? Answer Choices: (A) -3 (B) -2 (C) 1 (D) 2 (E) 3\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's translate the given information into an equation. a^2 * (-3) = 3(3a + 2) Simplifying the right side of the equation: a^2 * (-3) = 9a + 6 Multiplying both sides by -1 to get rid of the negative coefficient: a^2 * 3 = -9a - 6 Bringing all terms to one side: a^2 * 3 + 9a + 6 = 0 Now we can solve for a using the quadratic formula: a = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a a = (-9 \u00b1 sqrt(9^2 - 4(3)(6))) / 2(3) a = (-9 \u00b1 sqrt(57)) / 6 a \u2248 -2.07 or a \u2248 -1.26 Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: The product of two numbers is 276 and the sum of their squares is 289. The sum of the number is? Answer Choices: (A) A) 29 (B) B) 25 (C) C) 27 (D) D) 31 (E) E) 35\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the two numbers be x and y. We know that: xy = 276 (equation 1) x^2 + y^2 = 289 (equation 2) We want to find x + y. We can start by manipulating equation 2: x^2 + y^2 = 289 (x+y)^2 - 2xy = 289 (using the identity (x+y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2) (x+y)^2 = 841 (substituting xy = 276 from equation 1) x+y = sqrt(841) = 29 Therefore, the answer is (A) 29. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
