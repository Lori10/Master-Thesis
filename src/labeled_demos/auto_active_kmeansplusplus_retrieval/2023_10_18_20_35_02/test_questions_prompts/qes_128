  "test_question": "Q: Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc AC is 160\u00b0, and minor arc BD is 150\u00b0. If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD? Answer Choices: (A) 80\u00b0 (B) 130\u00b0 (C) 140\u00b0 (D) 160\u00b0 (E) 220\u00b0",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Angles AMB and CMD are right angles, \u2220AMD is acute, and \u2220BMC=y\u00b0 is acute. What is \u2220AMD ? Answer Choices: (A) 90\u00b0\u2212y (B) 180\u00b0\u2212y (C) 90\u00b0+y (D) 2y (E) y\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that angles AMB and CMD are right angles, which means they are both equal to 90 degrees. We also know that angle BMC is acute, which means it is less than 90 degrees. Since angles AMB and CMD are both right angles, they add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, angle AMD must be acute since it is less than 180 degrees. Now, let's use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. In triangle AMD, we have angles AMD, AMB, and CMD. AMD + AMB + CMD = 180 Substituting in the values we know: AMD + 90 + 90 = 180 Simplifying: AMD + 180 = 180 AMD = 0 This doesn't make sense since we know that angle AMD is acute. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: How many minutes are there in two right angles? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 22 (C) 17 (D) 2888 (E) 2880\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to understand what is meant by \"two right angles.\" A right angle is a 90-degree angle. So, two right angles would be 180 degrees. Next, we need to understand the relationship between degrees and minutes. There are 60 minutes in one degree. Therefore, to find the number of minutes in 180 degrees, we can multiply 180 by 60: 180 x 60 = 10,800 So, the answer is 10,800 minutes. None of the answer choices provided match this answer, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A rectangular of certain dimensions is chopped off from one corner of a larger rectangle as shown. AB = 8 cm and BC = 4 cm. The perimeter of the figure ABCPQRA (in cm) is : Answer Choices: (A) 24 (B) 28 (C) 36 (D) 48 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length of PQ. We can do this by using the Pythagorean theorem since triangle APQ is a right triangle. AP^2 + PQ^2 = AQ^2 We know that AP = AB = 8 cm and AQ = AB + BC = 12 cm. Substituting these values, we get: 8^2 + PQ^2 = 12^2 64 + PQ^2 = 144 PQ^2 = 80 PQ = sqrt(80) = 4sqrt(5) cm Next, we need to find the length of QR. We can do this by using the fact that QR is equal to BC, which is 4 cm. Now we can find the perimeter of the figure by adding up the lengths of all the sides: AB + BC + CP + PQ + QR + RA + AC = 8 + 4 + PQ + 4 + 8 + 4 + 4 = 32 + PQ = 32 + 4sqrt(5) = 28 + 4sqrt(5) Therefore, the answer is (E) None of these, since none of the given options match our answer. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: At 30 minutes past 4 O'clock, what is the angle between the two hands? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) I8 (C) 99 (D) 17 (E) 181\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, which is 30 degrees per hour. At 4:30, the hour hand has moved 4.5 hours * 30 degrees per hour = 135 degrees. The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, which is 6 degrees per minute. At 30 minutes past the hour, the minute hand has moved 30 minutes * 6 degrees per minute = 180 degrees. The angle between the two hands is the absolute difference between their positions. In this case, it is |135 - 180| = 45 degrees. None of the answer choices given match 45 degrees, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
