  "test_question": "Q: Last year, a Home Appliance Store sold an average(arithmetic mean) of 42 microwave ovens per month. In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 30 (C) 31 (D) 32 (E) None of the above",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The average of 10 numbers was calculated as 20. It is discovered later on that while calculating the average, one number, namely 86, was incorrectly read as 26. What is the correct average? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 23 (C) 24 (D) 25 (E) 26\nA: Let's think step by step. The sum of the 10 numbers is 10 x 20 = 200 (since the average is 20). If 86 was incorrectly read as 26, then the sum of the 10 numbers should have been 200 - 26 + 86 = 260. Therefore, the correct average is 260/10 = 26. So, the answer is (E) 26. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: The average of 20 numbers is zero. Of them, at the most, how many may be greater than zero? Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 10 (D) 19 (E) None of the above\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. Let's assume that there are 'n' numbers greater than zero. If the average of 20 numbers is zero, then the sum of all 20 numbers must be zero. Let's say the sum of the 'n' positive numbers is 'x' and the sum of the remaining (20-n) negative numbers is '-x'. So, we can write an equation as: x - (20-n)x/n = 0 Simplifying this equation, we get: n >= 10 Therefore, the maximum number of positive numbers can be 10. Hence, the answer is (C) 10. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The average of 6 numbers is 6.8. If one of the numbers is multiplied by a factor of 3, the average of the numbers increases to 9.2. What number is multiplied by 3? Answer Choices: (A)  9.5 (B)  8.0 (C)  7.2 (D)  5.0 (E)  4.0\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that the average of 6 numbers is 6.8. Therefore, the sum of the 6 numbers is 6.8 x 6 = 40.8. Step 2: Let's assume that the number that is multiplied by 3 is x. Therefore, the sum of the 6 numbers after this multiplication is 40.8 + 2x (since we are adding x and 2x to the sum of the original 6 numbers). Step 3: We also know that the new average is 9.2. Therefore, the sum of the 6 numbers after the multiplication is 9.2 x 6 = 55.2. Step 4: Equating the two sums from Step 2 and Step 3, we get: 40.8 + 2x = 55.2 Step 5: Solving for x, we get: 2x = 14.4 x = 7.2 Therefore, the number that is multiplied by 3 is 7.2. Answer: (C) 7.2 The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The average of 6 observations is 16. A new observation is included and the new average is decreased by 1. The seventh observation is? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 3 (C) 9 (D) 6 (E) 7\nA: Let's think step by step. The average of 6 observations is 16, so the sum of those 6 observations is 6 x 16 = 96. Let the seventh observation be x. When the seventh observation is included, the total number of observations becomes 7, so the new average is (96 + x)/7. We know that the new average is decreased by 1, so we can set up the equation: (96 + x)/7 = 16 - 1 Simplifying this equation, we get: (96 + x)/7 = 15 Multiplying both sides by 7, we get: 96 + x = 105 Subtracting 96 from both sides, we get: x = 9 Therefore, the seventh observation is 9. The answer is (C) 9. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
