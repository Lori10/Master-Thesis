  "test_question": "Q: Roberts has a property worth of $1023.65. But in a record his property worth is written as greatest positive even integer less than or equal to his property worth and it is divisible by 100. Find the difference between actual property and recorded property worth? Answer Choices: (A) 23.65 (B) 1000 (C) 35.62 (D) 2.65 (E) 1023.65",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If P and Q are positive integers related by the equation P = 10Q - 5, what is the remainder when P is divided by 5? Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 2 (D) 3 (E) 4\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that P = 10Q - 5. To find the remainder when P is divided by 5, we can simplify the equation by taking the remainder of each term when divided by 5. 10Q has a remainder of 0 when divided by 5, since it is a multiple of 5. -5 has a remainder of 0 when divided by 5, since -5 = (-1) x 5. Therefore, P has a remainder of 0 - 0 = 0 when divided by 5. So the answer is (A) 0. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Peter has $642,986 in his savings account. What is the least amount of money (in whole number of dollars) that he must add to his account if he wants to split this money evenly among his nine children? Answer Choices: (A) $642,986 (B) $642,987 (C) $642,988 (D) $642,989 (E) $642,990\nA: Let's think step by step. Peter wants to split his savings evenly among his nine children. This means he needs to divide his savings by 9 to find out how much each child will get. $642,986 \u00f7 9 = $71,443.88 However, we need to add a whole number of dollars to his account, so we need to round up to the nearest dollar. $71,443.88 rounded up to the nearest dollar is $71,444. Therefore, Peter needs to add $71,444 to his savings account to split the money evenly among his nine children. The correct answer is (D) $642,989. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Find the greatest number which on dividing 3815 and 4521, leaves a reminder of 31 and 33 respectively Answer Choices: (A) 88 (B) 56 (C) 89 (D) 86 (E) 96\nA: Let's think step by step. We need to find a number that leaves a remainder of 31 when it divides 3815 and a remainder of 33 when it divides 4521. Let's start by finding the factors of the difference between the two numbers: 4521 - 3815 = 706 The factors of 706 are: 1, 2, 353, and 706. Now we need to find which of these factors leaves a remainder of 31 when it divides 3815 and a remainder of 33 when it divides 4521. Let's try each factor: - 1: Leaves a remainder of 0 for both 3815 and 4521, so it's not the answer. - 2: Leaves a remainder of 1 when it divides 3815 and a remainder of 17 when it divides 4521, so it's not the answer. - 353: Leaves a remainder of 31 when it divides 3815 and a remainder of 33 when it divides 4521, so this is a possible answer. - 706: Leaves a remainder of 0 for both 3815 and 4521, so it's not the answer. Therefore, the greatest number that satisfies the conditions is 353. The answer is (C) 89. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In the above number, A and B represent the tens and units digits, respectively. If the above number is divisible by 25, what is the greatest possible value of B x A? Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 15 (C) 20 (D) 25 (E) 35\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that a number is divisible by 25 if and only if its last two digits are divisible by 25. Therefore, we need to find the possible values of AB that are divisible by 25. The units digit B can only be 0, 5, or 10 (since it is a multiple of 5). If B is 0, then AB is also 0 and the product is 0. If B is 5, then AB is either 15 or 25. If B is 10, then AB is either 20 or 30. Out of these options, the greatest possible value of B x A is 25, which occurs when B is 5 and A is 5. Therefore, the answer is (D) 25. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
