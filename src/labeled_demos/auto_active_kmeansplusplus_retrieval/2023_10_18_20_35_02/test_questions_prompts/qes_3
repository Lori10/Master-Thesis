We are given that a(a-4) = 5 and b(b-4) = 5. We need to find the value of a+b. First, let's simplify the given equations: a(a-4) = 5 a^2 - 4a = 5 a^2 - 4a - 5 = 0 Similarly, b(b-4) = 5 b^2 - 4b = 5 b^2 - 4b - 5 = 0 Now, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for a and b: a = (4 \u00b1 \u221a36)/2 = 2 \u00b1 3 b = (4 \u00b1 \u221a36)/2 = 2 \u00b1 3 Since a \u2260 b, we know that a and b have different values. Therefore, the only possible values for a and b are (2+3) and (2-3), which are 5 and -1 in some order. So, a+b = 5 + (-1) = 4. Therefore, the answer is (C) 4. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The product of a and b is equal to 1 more than twice the sum of a and b. If b = 7, what is the value of b - a? Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 5 (C) 4 (D) 24 (E) 35\nA: Let's think step by step. The problem states that the product of a and b is equal to 1 more than twice the sum of a and b. We can write this as: ab = 2(a + b) + 1 We are also given that b = 7. Substituting this into the equation above, we get: a(7) = 2(a + 7) + 1 Simplifying this equation, we get: 7a = 2a + 14 + 1 5a = 15 a = 3 Now we can find b - a: b - a = 7 - 3 = 4 Therefore, the answer is (C) 4. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A numberais squared and then multiplied by negative 3. The result of this operation T is equal to three times the sum of three timesaand two. What is one possible value ofa? Answer Choices: (A) -3 (B) -2 (C) 1 (D) 2 (E) 3\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's translate the given information into an equation. a^2 * (-3) = 3(3a + 2) Simplifying the right side of the equation: a^2 * (-3) = 9a + 6 Multiplying both sides by -1 to get rid of the negative coefficient: a^2 * 3 = -9a - 6 Bringing all terms to one side: a^2 * 3 + 9a + 6 = 0 Now we can solve for a using the quadratic formula: a = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a a = (-9 \u00b1 sqrt(9^2 - 4(3)(6))) / 2(3) a = (-9 \u00b1 sqrt(57)) / 6 a \u2248 -2.07 or a \u2248 -1.26 Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: If a and b are consecutive integers (b>a), which of the following statements could be false? 1. a^2+b is an even number. 2. ab is even number 3. (a + b) is always an odd number. Answer Choices: (A) II only (B) III only (C) I,II only (D) I only (E) I,III only\nA: Let's think step by step. If a and b are consecutive integers, then b = a + 1. 1. a^2 + b = a^2 + (a + 1) = (a^2 + a) + 1. Since a(a+1) is always even, the sum of an even number and 1 is always odd. Therefore, statement 1 is always true. 2. ab = a(a+1) is the product of two consecutive integers. One of them must be even and the other odd. Therefore, the product is always even. Statement 2 is always true. 3. a + b = a + (a+1) = 2a + 1. Since a is an integer, 2a is always even. Therefore, 2a + 1 is always odd. Statement 3 is always true. Therefore, none of the statements could be false. The answer is (E) None of the above. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
