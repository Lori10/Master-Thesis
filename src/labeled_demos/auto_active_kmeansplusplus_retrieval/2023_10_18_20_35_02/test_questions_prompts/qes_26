  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A and B invest in a business in the ratio 3 : 2. If 5% of the total profit goes to charity and A's share is Rs. 855, the total profit is: Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 1425 (B) Rs. 1500 (C) Rs. 1537.50 (D) Rs. 1576 (E) Rs. 1600\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the total profit be x. Since A and B invest in the ratio 3:2, their share of profit will also be in the ratio 3:2. Let A's share be 3y, and B's share be 2y. Now, we know that 5% of the total profit goes to charity. So, the remaining 95% will be divided between A and B in the ratio 3:2. Therefore, A's share will be (3/5) * 95% * x = 57% of x. We are given that A's share is Rs. 855. So, 57% of x = 855. Solving for x, we get x = Rs. 1500. Therefore, the total profit is Rs. 1500. Hence, the correct answer is option (B) Rs. 1500. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Three friends had dinner at a restaurant. When the bill was received, Akshitha paid 1/4 as much as Veena paid and Veena paid 1/2 as much as Lasya paid. What fraction of the bill did Veena pay ? Answer Choices: (A) 3/19 (B) 3/12 (C) 3/11 (D) 3/10 (E) 4/13\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that Lasya paid x amount for the dinner. According to the problem, Veena paid 1/2 as much as Lasya paid. So, Veena paid (1/2)x amount for the dinner. And, Akshitha paid 1/4 as much as Veena paid. So, Akshitha paid (1/4)(1/2)x = (1/8)x amount for the dinner. Now, the total bill is the sum of what all three friends paid. So, x + (1/2)x + (1/8)x = (13/8)x Therefore, Veena paid (1/2)x = (4/13)(13/8)x = (1/2) * (13/8)x = (13/16)x amount for the dinner. So, the answer is (E) 4/13. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A and B invests Rs.8000 and Rs.9000 in a business. After 4 months, A withdraws half of his capital and 2 months later, B withdraws one-third of his capital. In what ratio should they share the profits at the end of the year? Answer Choices: (A) 32:45 (B) 32:37 (C) 32:41 (D) 32:47 (E) 32:48\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. Let the total profit be x. A invests Rs.8000 and B invests Rs.9000. After 4 months, A withdraws half of his capital, which means he withdraws Rs.4000. So, A's investment for the remaining 8 months is Rs.4000. B does not withdraw any amount after 4 months. After 6 months (2 months after A's withdrawal), B withdraws one-third of his capital, which means he withdraws Rs.3000. So, B's investment for the remaining 6 months is Rs.6000. Now, let's calculate the ratio of their investments for the entire year. A's investment for the year = (4/12)*8000 + (8/12)*4000 = 2667 + 2667 = 5334 B's investment for the year = (6/12)*9000 + (6/12)*6000 = 4500 + 3000 = 7500 Therefore, the ratio of their investments for the entire year is 5334:7500, which simplifies to 32:45. Hence, the answer is (A) 32:45. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A and B together invested Rs. 9,000 in a business. At the end of the year, out of total profit is Rs. 3,000 B's share was Rs. 1500. A's investment was Answer Choices: (A) s. 4,500 (B) s. 8,250 (C) s. 10,500 (D) s. 11,250 (E) s. 12,250\nA: Let's think step by step. Let A's investment be x. Then, B's investment will be (9000-x). Now, we know that out of the total profit of Rs. 3000, B's share was Rs. 1500. So, A's share will be (3000-1500) = Rs. 1500. We can set up the following equation: (B's share of profit) / (A's share of profit) = (B's investment) / (A's investment) 1500 / 1500 = (9000-x) / x Simplifying this equation, we get: 1 = (9000-x) / x x = Rs. 4500 Therefore, A's investment was Rs. 4500. The correct answer is (A) Rs. 4,500. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
