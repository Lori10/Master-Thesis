  "test_question": "Q: Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes. If they start rotating now from the same point, when will they be at the same starting point again? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes (B) 2 hour and 31 minutes (C) 3 hour and 31 minutes (D) 4 hour and 31 minutes (E) 5 hour and 31 minutes",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: At what time between 7 and 8 o\u2019clock will the hands of a clock be in the same straight line but, not together? Answer Choices: (A) 5 min. past 7 (B) 5 2\u204411 min. past 7 (C) 5 3\u204411 min. past 7 (D) 5 5\u204411 min. past 7 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. The hour hand moves 30 degrees in one hour (360 degrees divided by 12 hours) and 0.5 degrees in one minute (30 degrees divided by 60 minutes). The minute hand moves 6 degrees in one minute (360 degrees divided by 60 minutes). Let's assume that x minutes have passed since 7 o'clock. The angle between the hour and minute hand is given by: |0.5x - 30h|, where h is the hour hand position in degrees. At 7 o'clock, the hour hand is at 210 degrees (7 hours times 30 degrees). Substituting this value, we get: |0.5x - 210| - 6x = 0 Solving for x, we get: 0.5x - 210 = 6x or 0.5x - 210 = -6x Solving for x in both cases, we get: x = 252/11 or x = 210/11 The first solution corresponds to 5 7/11 minutes past 7 and the second solution corresponds to 5 2/11 minutes past 7. Therefore, the answer is (B) 5 2/11 min. past 7. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: At 30 minutes past 4 O'clock, what is the angle between the two hands? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) I8 (C) 99 (D) 17 (E) 181\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, which is 30 degrees per hour. At 4:30, the hour hand has moved 4.5 hours * 30 degrees per hour = 135 degrees. The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, which is 6 degrees per minute. At 30 minutes past the hour, the minute hand has moved 30 minutes * 6 degrees per minute = 180 degrees. The angle between the two hands is the absolute difference between their positions. In this case, it is |135 - 180| = 45 degrees. None of the answer choices given match 45 degrees, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: What would happen in the previous question if both A and B had started at point P. Answer Choices: (A) 800 Km (B) 600 Km (C) 1000 Km (D) 350 Km (E) 250 Km\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that A travels at a speed of 50 km/h and B travels at a speed of 40 km/h. If they both started at point P, they would be moving in opposite directions. Let's say they meet after x hours. In that time, A would have traveled 50x km and B would have traveled 40x km. We also know that the distance between A and B is 600 km. So, we can set up the equation: 50x + 40x = 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 90x = 600 x = 6.67 hours Now that we know they meet after 6.67 hours, we can find out how far each of them has traveled: A: 50 km/h x 6.67 h = 333.33 km B: 40 km/h x 6.67 h = 266.67 km The total distance they have traveled is: 333.33 km + 266.67 km = 600 km Therefore, the answer is (B) 600 km. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: At 6'o clock clock ticks 6 times. The time between first and\nlast ticks was 30sec. How much time it takes at 12'o clock. Answer Choices: (A) 60sec (B) 62sec (C) 66sec (D) 64sec (E) 76sec\nA: Let's think step by step. At 6'o clock, the clock ticks 6 times, which means that each tick is 1/6th of a full rotation. The time between the first and last ticks is 30 seconds, and there are 5 intervals between the 6 ticks. Therefore, each interval is 30/5 = 6 seconds. At 12'o clock, the clock ticks 12 times, which means that each tick is 1/12th of a full rotation. Using the same logic as before, the time between the first and last ticks at 12'o clock would be 11 intervals of 1/12th of a rotation, which is 11/12ths of a full rotation. So, the time it takes between the first and last ticks at 12'o clock would be (11/12) * 60 seconds = 55 seconds. None of the answer choices match this result, so the answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
