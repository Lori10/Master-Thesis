  "test_question": "Q: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point. Answer Choices: (A) 238 (B) 289 (C) 200 (D) 287 (E) 187",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: What would happen in the previous question if both A and B had started at point P. Answer Choices: (A) 800 Km (B) 600 Km (C) 1000 Km (D) 350 Km (E) 250 Km\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that A travels at a speed of 50 km/h and B travels at a speed of 40 km/h. If they both started at point P, they would be moving in opposite directions. Let's say they meet after x hours. In that time, A would have traveled 50x km and B would have traveled 40x km. We also know that the distance between A and B is 600 km. So, we can set up the equation: 50x + 40x = 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 90x = 600 x = 6.67 hours Now that we know they meet after 6.67 hours, we can find out how far each of them has traveled: A: 50 km/h x 6.67 h = 333.33 km B: 40 km/h x 6.67 h = 266.67 km The total distance they have traveled is: 333.33 km + 266.67 km = 600 km Therefore, the answer is (B) 600 km. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A man traveled a total distance of 1800 km. He traveled one-third of the whole trip by plane and the distance traveled by train is three-fifth of the distance traveled by bus. If he traveled by train, plane and bus, then find the distance traveled by bus? Answer Choices: (A) 450 km (B) 850 km (C) 1200 km (D) 750 km (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the distance traveled by plane be x km. Then, the distance traveled by train is (3/5)(2/3)(1800-x) km (since he traveled one-third of the whole trip by plane). The distance traveled by bus is the remaining distance, which is 1800 - x - (3/5)(2/3)(1800-x) km. Simplifying this expression, we get: 1800 - x - (3/5)(2/3)(1800-x) = 1800 - x - (2/5)(1800-x) = 1800 - x - (3600/5 - 2x/5) = (3x/5) + 720 We want to find the value of this expression that is equal to the distance traveled by bus. Looking at the answer choices, we see that (A) 450 km is too small, (B) 850 km is too large, and (C) 1200 km is too large. So, we try (D) 750 km: (3x/5) + 720 = 750 3x/5 = 30 x = 50 Therefore, the distance traveled by plane is 50 km, the distance traveled by train is (3/5)(2/3)(1800-50) = 480 km, and the distance traveled by bus is 1800 - 50 - 480 = 1270 km. None of the answer choices match this value, so the correct answer is (E) None of these. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Two trains of equal lengths take 10 sec and 15 sec respectively to cross a telegraph post. If the length of each train be 120 m, in what time will they cross other travelling in opposite direction? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 12 (C) 13 (D) 14 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. The total distance covered by both trains when they cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is 240 meters. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds, since they are travelling in opposite directions. Let's call this speed \"v\". We know that the first train takes 10 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/10 = 12 m/s. Similarly, the second train takes 15 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/15 = 8 m/s. Therefore, the relative speed of the two trains is v = 12 + 8 = 20 m/s. To find the time it takes for the two trains to cross each other, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed Plugging in the values we know, we get: time = 240 / 20 = 12 seconds Therefore, the answer is (B) 12. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A man complete a journey in 10 hours. He travels first half of the journey at the rate of 20 km/hr and second half at the rate of 20 km/hr. Find the total journey in km. Answer Choices: (A) 220 km (B) 224 km (C) 230 km (D) 232 km (E) 200 km\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the total distance be 'd' km. The man travels the first half of the journey at a speed of 20 km/hr. Therefore, he covers the first half of the distance in d/2 * 20 = 10d/2 = 5d hours. Similarly, he covers the second half of the journey at a speed of 20 km/hr. Therefore, he covers the second half of the distance in d/2 * 20 = 10d/2 = 5d hours. Since the total time taken for the journey is 10 hours, we can write the equation: 5d/20 + 5d/20 = 10 Simplifying this equation, we get: d = 200 km Therefore, the total journey is 200 km. Hence, the correct answer is (E) 200 km. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
