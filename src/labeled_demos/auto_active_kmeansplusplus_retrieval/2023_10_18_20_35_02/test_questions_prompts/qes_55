  "test_question": "Q: If Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back and Raj is 17 years old now, How old is Rahim now? Answer Choices: (A) 37 (B) 41 (C) 40 (D) 42 (E) 43",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Current ages of Rahim and Thomas are in the ratio of 5 : 4 correspondingly. 0.7 decades hence, the ratio of their ages will become 11 : 9 correspondingly, What is Thomas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current age in years? Answer Choices: (A) 24 years (B) 44 years (C) 34 years (D) 64 years (E) 84 years\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that Rahim's current age is 5x and Thomas's current age is 4x. 0.7 decades hence means 7 years. So, after 7 years, Rahim's age will be 5x + 7 and Thomas's age will be 4x + 7. According to the problem, the ratio of their ages after 7 years will be 11:9. Therefore, we can write the equation: (5x + 7)/(4x + 7) = 11/9 Cross-multiplying, we get: 99x + 77 = 44x + 77 55x = 0 x = 0 This is not possible, so there must be an error in the problem. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 99 (C) 88 (D) 77 (E) 23\nA: Let's think step by step. Let Q's age be x. Then, R's age will be (x + y) and T's age will be (x - y), where y is the age difference between Q and T. Given, (x + y) + (x - y) = 50 2x = 50 x = 25 Therefore, Q's age is 25. Also, R's age is (25 + y). Given, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, (25 + y) - 25 = 25 - (25 - y) y = 12.5 Therefore, R's age is (25 + 12.5) = 37.5 The difference between R and Q's age is (37.5 - 25) = 12.5 Hence, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Ayesha's father was 38 years of age when she was born while her mother was 36 years old when her brother six years younger to her was born. What is the difference between the ages of her parents? Answer Choices: (A) 2 years (B) 4 years (C) 6 years (D) 7 years (E) 8 years\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We know that Ayesha's father was 38 years old when she was born. Let's call his age F. We also know that Ayesha's mother was 36 years old when her brother, who is six years younger than Ayesha, was born. Let's call her mother's age M. So, Ayesha's brother's age would be (Ayesha's age - 6). Let's call his age B. Now, we can set up two equations: F = Ayesha's age + 38 M = (Ayesha's age - 6) + 36 Simplifying the second equation, we get: M = Ayesha's age + 30 Now, we can set the two equations equal to each other and solve for Ayesha's age: Ayesha's age + 38 = Ayesha's age + 30 8 = 0 This is not possible, so none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: Rajesh solved 80 per cent of the questions in an examination correctly. If out of 41 questions solved by Rajesh 37 questions are correct and of the remaining questions out of 8 questions 5 questions have been solved by Rajesh correctly then find the total number of questions asked in the examination. Answer Choices: (A) 75 (B) 65 (C) 60 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Rajesh solved 80% of the questions correctly. This means that he got 37 questions correct out of a total of x questions. We can write this as: 0.8x = 37 Solving for x, we get: x = 46.25 However, we know that the number of questions asked in the examination must be a whole number. Therefore, we can assume that the actual number of questions asked is either 46 or 47. Next, we know that Rajesh solved a total of 41 questions. Of these, 37 were correct and 4 were incorrect. This means that he attempted 8 - 4 = 4 questions in the remaining set of questions. We also know that he got 5 out of these 8 questions correct. Therefore, the total number of questions asked in the examination is: 37 + 4 + 5 = 46 So the answer is (A) 75. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
