  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A certain ski shop sells pairs of gloves in 10 different colors. If one pair of each color is dropped in a bag and a store clerk reaches in to draw two individual gloves simultaneously and at random, what is the probability that she draws two gloves of the same color? Answer Choices: (A) 1/144 (B) 1/143 (C) 1/24 (D) 1/23 (E) 1/19\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. There are 10 different colors of gloves, so there are 10 pairs of gloves in total. When the store clerk reaches in to draw two individual gloves simultaneously and at random, there are a total of 20 gloves in the bag. To calculate the probability of drawing two gloves of the same color, we need to first calculate the total number of possible outcomes. The total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to choose 2 gloves out of 20, which is: 20 choose 2 = (20 * 19) / (2 * 1) = 190 Next, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to choose 2 gloves of the same color. There are 10 different colors to choose from, so the number of ways to choose 2 gloves of the same color is: 10 choose 1 = 10 For each color, there are 2 gloves to choose from, so the total number of ways to choose 2 gloves of the same color is: 10 * (2 choose 2) = 10 Therefore, the probability of drawing two gloves of the same color is: 10 / 190 = 1/19 So the correct answer is (E) 1/19. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Six students are equally divided into 3 groups, then, the three groups were assigned to three different topics. How many different arrangements Q are possible? Answer Choices: (A)  30 (B)  60 (C)  90 (D)  180 (E)  540\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We need to find the number of ways to divide 6 students equally into 3 groups. This can be done using combinations. We need to choose 2 students from 6 for the first group, then 2 students from the remaining 4 for the second group, and the remaining 2 students will be in the third group. The number of ways to choose 2 students from 6 is 6C2 = 15. The number of ways to choose 2 students from 4 is 4C2 = 6. So the total number of ways to divide 6 students equally into 3 groups is 15 x 6 = 90. Step 2: We need to find the number of ways to assign the 3 groups to 3 different topics. This can be done in 3! = 6 ways. Step 3: We need to find the total number of arrangements Q by multiplying the results of step 1 and step 2. Q = 90 x 6 = 540. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 540. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In a game of billiards, A can give B 20 points in 60 and he can give C 30 points in 60. How many points can B give C in a game of 120? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 77 (C) 45 (D) 18 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many points A can give B in a game of 120. We can use the ratio of 20 points in 60 to find out how many points A can give B in 120. 20 points in 60 minutes is equivalent to (20/60) = 1/3 points per minute. Therefore, in 120 minutes, A can give B (1/3 x 120) = 40 points. Now, we need to find out how many points A can give C in a game of 120. Using the same method as above, we get: 30 points in 60 minutes is equivalent to (30/60) = 1/2 points per minute. Therefore, in 120 minutes, A can give C (1/2 x 120) = 60 points. Now, we need to find out how many points B can give C in a game of 120. Let's assume that B can give C x points in 120 minutes. In 120 minutes, A can give B 40 points and A can give C 60 points. Therefore, B can give C (60 - 40) = 20 points in 120 minutes. Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match our calculation. The correct answer is 20. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In how many ways can 6 apples (identical) be distributed among 5 children? (Some children may get no apples.) Answer Choices: (A) 124 (B) 210 (C) 128 (D) 130 (E) 132\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the stars and bars method to solve this problem. We need to distribute 6 identical apples among 5 children, which means we need to place 4 dividers (bars) among the 6 apples to separate them into 5 groups. For example, if we place the dividers like this: * | * * | * * * it means the first child gets 1 apple, the second child gets 2 apples, the third child gets 3 apples, the fourth child gets 0 apples, and the fifth child gets 0 apples. The number of ways to place 4 dividers among 6 apples is the same as the number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 10 (6 apples and 4 dividers). This can be calculated as: 10 choose 4 = 10! / (4! * 6!) = 210 Therefore, the answer is (B) 210. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
