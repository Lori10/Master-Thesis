  "test_question": "Q: A two digit number exceeds the sum of the digits of that number by 18. If the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, what is the number? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 24 (C) 42 (D) 48 (E) 49",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: How many 4-digit Q numbers (ABCD) can be formed such that |A \u2013 D| = 2? Answer Choices: (A) 2,000 (B) 1,900 (C) 1,800 (D) 1,600 (E) 1,500\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that |A \u2013 D| = 2. This means that A and D are either 2 digits apart or 2 digits away from each other in the number line. Case 1: A is 2 digits greater than D. In this case, we can choose any digit from 1 to 9 for D (since it's a 4-digit number, we can't have 0 as the first digit). Then, A can be any digit that is 2 greater than D, except for 9 (since we can't have a 5th digit). So, there are 8 choices for A. Case 2: D is 2 digits greater than A. This is the same as Case 1, but with A and D switched. So, there are also 8 choices for A in this case. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit Q numbers that can be formed is 8 + 8 = 16. The answer is (D) 1,600. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If you add all the numbers on your mobile phone except 9, what is the answer? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 28 (C) 65 (D) 36 (E) 42\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to identify all the numbers on a mobile phone except 9. These are the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Next, we need to add all these digits together. 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36 Therefore, the answer is (D) 36. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: One half of a two digit number exceeds its one third by 6. What is the sum of the digits of the number? Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 5 (C) 7 (D) 9 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the two-digit number to be 'xy', where x is the tens digit and y is the units digit. According to the problem, 1/2(xy) - 1/3(xy) = 6 Multiplying both sides by 6, we get: 3xy - 2xy = 36 xy = 36 Now we know that the two-digit number is 36. The sum of the digits of the number is 3 + 6 = 9. Therefore, the answer is (D) 9. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: How many three-digit whole numbers yield a remainder of 1 when divided by 10 and also yield a remainder of 1 when divided by 6? Answer Choices: (A) None (B) One (C) Two (D) Three (E) Four\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 10. These numbers are of the form 10a + 1, where a is an integer. Next, we need to find the numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 6. These numbers are of the form 6b + 1, where b is an integer. To find the numbers that satisfy both conditions, we need to find the values of a and b that make 10a + 1 and 6b + 1 equal. 10a + 1 = 6b + 1 Simplifying, we get: 10a = 6b Dividing both sides by 2, we get: 5a = 3b This means that a must be a multiple of 3 and b must be a multiple of 5. The smallest three-digit number that satisfies both conditions is 121 (10*12+1). The next number is 181 (10*18+1). Therefore, the answer is (C) Two. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
