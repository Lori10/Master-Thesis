  "formatted_prompt": "Q: James took a 3-hour bike ride. In the second hour he travlled 18 miles, which was 20 percent farther than he traveled the first hour. If he traveled 25 percent farther in the third hour than he did in the second hour, how many miles did jose travel during the entire ride? Answer Choices: (A) 54.0 (B) 54.9 (C) 55.5 (D) 57.0 (E) 63.0\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how far James traveled in the first hour. We know that in the second hour he traveled 20% farther than in the first hour, so we can set up the equation: 18 = 1.2x where x is the distance James traveled in the first hour. Solving for x, we get: x = 15 Next, we need to find out how far James traveled in the third hour. We know that in the third hour he traveled 25% farther than in the second hour, so we can set up the equation: d = 1.25(18) where d is the distance James traveled in the third hour. Solving for d, we get: d = 22.5 Finally, we can add up the distances traveled in each hour to find the total distance traveled: total distance = 15 + 18 + 22.5 = 55.5 Therefore, the answer is (C) 55.5. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: One hour after Yolanda started walking from X to Y, a distance of 24 miles, Bob started walking along the same road from Y to X. If Yolanda's walking rate was 3 miles per hour and Bob\u0442's was 4 miles per hour, how many miles had Bob walked when they met? Answer Choices: (A) 24 (B) 23 (C) 22 (D) 21 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it took Yolanda to reach the meeting point. We can use the formula distance = rate x time, where distance is 24 miles and rate is 3 miles per hour. So, time = distance / rate = 24 / 3 = 8 hours. Now, we can use the same formula to find out how far Bob walked in 8 hours at a rate of 4 miles per hour. distance = rate x time = 4 x 8 = 32 miles. However, we need to subtract the distance Yolanda walked in 8 hours to find out the distance Bob walked before they met. Yolanda walked 3 x 8 = 24 miles in 8 hours. So, Bob walked 32 - 24 = 8 miles before they met. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 8. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: The speed of a car increases by 2 kms after every one hour. If the distance travelling in the first one hour was 35 kms. what was the total distance travelled in 12 hours? Answer Choices: (A) 456 kms (B) 482 kms (C) 552 kms (D) 556 kms (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. After the first hour, the car would have travelled 35 + 2 = 37 kms. After the second hour, the car would have travelled 37 + 2 = 39 kms. Similarly, after the third hour, the car would have travelled 41 kms, after the fourth hour, it would have travelled 43 kms, and so on. So, after 12 hours, the car would have travelled a total distance of: 35 + 37 + 39 + ... + 47 + 49 = (12/2) * (35 + 49) = 12 * 42 = 504 kms Therefore, the correct answer is (E) None of these, as none of the given options match the calculated answer. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A student traveled 25 percent of the distance of the trip alone, continued another 40 miles with a friend, and then finished the last half of the trip alone. How many miles long was the trip? Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 140 (C) 160 (D) 180 (E) 200\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the total distance of the trip is \"x\" miles. The student traveled 25% of the distance alone, which is 0.25x miles. Then, the student traveled another 40 miles with a friend. So, the distance traveled by the student alone before meeting the friend is (0.25x - 40) miles. The remaining distance that the student traveled alone is (0.5x - 40) miles. Now, we can add up all the distances traveled by the student to get the total distance of the trip: 0.25x + (0.25x - 40) + 40 + (0.5x - 40) = x Simplifying this equation, we get: 1x = 200 Therefore, the total distance of the trip is 200 miles. The answer is (E) 200. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
