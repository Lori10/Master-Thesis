  "formatted_prompt": "Q: It takes 40 identical printing presses 15 hours to print 500,000 papers. How many hours would it take 30 of these printing presses to print 500,000 papers? Answer Choices: (A) 16 (B) 18 (C) 20 (D) 21 (E) 24\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 40 printing presses can print 500,000 papers in 15 hours. So, we can find the rate of printing of each press by dividing the total number of papers by the total number of hours and the number of presses: Rate of each press = 500,000 / (40 x 15) = 833.33 papers per hour Now, we need to find how many hours it would take 30 printing presses to print 500,000 papers at the same rate. Total time = Total number of papers / (Rate of each press x Number of presses) Total time = 500,000 / (833.33 x 30) Total time = 20 hours Therefore, the answer is (C) 20. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: 8 people decided to split the restaurant bill evenly. If the bill was $214.18 dollars, how much money did they 1 cent is the smallest unit? Answer Choices: (A) $214.16 (B) $214.17 (C) $214.18 (D) $214.19 (E) $214.24\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to divide the total bill by the number of people to find out how much each person should pay. $214.18 \u00f7 8 = $26.7725 Since we cannot have a fraction of a cent, we need to round up to the nearest cent. $26.77 rounds up to $26.78 Therefore, each person should pay $26.78. The closest answer choice is (B) $214.17, but that is not the correct answer. The correct answer is None of the above. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A bookseller sells his books at a 25% markup in price. If he sells a book for $12.5, how much did he pay for it? Answer Choices: (A) $14.40 (B) $14.00 (C) $11.00 (D) $9.60 (E) $10.00\nA: Let's think step by step. The bookseller sells his books at a 25% markup in price, which means he sells the book for 125% of its original price. Let's assume the original price of the book is x. Then, the selling price of the book is 1.25x. We know that the selling price of the book is $12.5. So, 1.25x = $12.5 Solving for x, we get x = $10. Therefore, the bookseller paid $10 for the book. The correct answer is (E) $10.00. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A man sells an article at a gain 15%. If he had bought it at 10% less and sold it for 6 less, he would have gained 25%. Find the cost price of the article. Answer Choices: (A) 150 (B) 160 (C) 170 (D) 180 (E) 240\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the cost price of the article be x. According to the question, he sells the article at a gain of 15%, so the selling price would be 1.15x. Now, if he had bought it at 10% less, the cost price would be 0.9x. And if he had sold it for 6 less, the selling price would be 1.15x - 6. According to the question, if he had done this, he would have gained 25%. So, we can write: 1.15x - (1.15x - 6) = 0.25(0.9x) Simplifying this equation, we get: 6 = 0.025x x = 240 Therefore, the cost price of the article is 240. The correct answer is (E) 240. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
