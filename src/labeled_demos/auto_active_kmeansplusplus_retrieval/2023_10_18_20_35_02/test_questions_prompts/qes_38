  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Ayush was born two years after his father's marriage. His mother is five years younger than his father but 22 years older than Ayush who is 10 years old. At what age did the father get married ? Answer Choices: (A) 22years (B) 23years (C) 24years (D) 25years (E) 26years\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the father got married at age x. According to the problem, Ayush is currently 10 years old. Therefore, his father's age would be (x + 10) years old. We also know that Ayush's mother is 5 years younger than his father. Therefore, her age would be (x + 10 - 5) = (x + 5) years old. Finally, we know that Ayush's mother is 22 years older than Ayush. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 5 = 10 + 22 Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 27 Therefore, the father got married at age 27 - 2 = 25 years old. The correct answer is (D) 25 years. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A man is 24 years older than his son. In two years, his age will be twice the age of his son. The present age of the son is? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 25 (C) 27 (D) 22 (E) 91\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the present age of the son be x. According to the problem, the man is 24 years older than his son, so his present age is x + 24. In two years, the man's age will be x + 24 + 2 = x + 26, and the son's age will be x + 2. The problem states that in two years, the man's age will be twice the age of his son: x + 26 = 2(x + 2) Simplifying the equation: x + 26 = 2x + 4 Subtracting x from both sides: 26 = x + 4 Subtracting 4 from both sides: 22 = x Therefore, the present age of the son is 22. The correct answer is (D) 22. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Ayesha's father was 38 years of age when she was born while her mother was 36 years old when her brother six years younger to her was born. What is the difference between the ages of her parents? Answer Choices: (A) 2 years (B) 4 years (C) 6 years (D) 7 years (E) 8 years\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We know that Ayesha's father was 38 years old when she was born. Let's call his age F. We also know that Ayesha's mother was 36 years old when her brother, who is six years younger than Ayesha, was born. Let's call her mother's age M. So, Ayesha's brother's age would be (Ayesha's age - 6). Let's call his age B. Now, we can set up two equations: F = Ayesha's age + 38 M = (Ayesha's age - 6) + 36 Simplifying the second equation, we get: M = Ayesha's age + 30 Now, we can set the two equations equal to each other and solve for Ayesha's age: Ayesha's age + 38 = Ayesha's age + 30 8 = 0 This is not possible, so none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: At the time of marriage, a man was 8 years elder to his wife. 15 years after their marriage, his age is 5/4 times the age of his wife. What was wife's age at the time of marriage ? Choose one answer. Answer Choices: (A) 15 years (B) 30 years (C) 18 years (D) 17 years (E) 26 years\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the man's age at the time of marriage to be M and his wife's age to be W. According to the problem, we know that: M = W + 8 (as the man was 8 years elder to his wife at the time of marriage) 15 years after their marriage, the man's age is 5/4 times the age of his wife. So, we can write: M + 15 = (5/4)(W + 15) Now, we can substitute the value of M from the first equation: W + 8 + 15 = (5/4)(W + 15) Simplifying this equation: W + 23 = (5/4)W + (75/4) Multiplying both sides by 4: 4W + 92 = 5W + 75 Subtracting 4W from both sides: W = 17 Therefore, the wife's age at the time of marriage was 17 years. Hence, the correct answer is option (D) 17 years. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
