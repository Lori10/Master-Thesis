  "test_question": "Q: A box contains a certain number of balls, marked successively from 1 to n. If there are 45 different ways that two balls can be selected from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, then what is the value of n? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 10 (C) 9 (D) 8 (E) 7",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A student must answer 7 out of 10 questions on an examination. If at least 3 of the first 5 questions must be answered, how many possible combinations of 7 questions are available to the student?\n. Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 80 (C) 110 (D) 220 (E) 360\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that the student must answer 7 out of 10 questions, so we need to find the number of ways to choose 7 questions out of 10. This can be calculated using the combination formula: 10C7 = 10! / (7! * 3!) = 120 So there are 120 possible combinations of 7 questions. Step 2: We also know that at least 3 of the first 5 questions must be answered. This means that the student can either answer 3, 4, or 5 questions from the first 5. Step 3: We need to find the number of ways to choose the remaining questions from the remaining 5. This can be calculated using the combination formula: 5C4 + 5C3 + 5C2 = 5! / (4! * 1!) + 5! / (3! * 2!) + 5! / (2! * 3!) = 5 + 10 + 10 = 25 So there are 25 ways to choose the remaining questions. Step 4: We can now find the total number of possible combinations by multiplying the results from step 2 and step 3: (3C3 * 5C4) + (4C3 * 5C3) + (5C3 * 5C2) = (1 * 5) + (4 * 10) + (10 * 10) = 5 + 40 + 100 = 145 Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the correct answer of 145. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The number of sequences in which 5 players can throw a ball, so that the youngest player may not be the last is ? Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 96 (C) 8 (D) 62 (E) 10\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of sequences in which 5 players can throw a ball. This can be calculated as 5! (5 factorial) which is equal to 120. Next, we need to find the number of sequences in which the youngest player is the last. In this case, we can fix the youngest player in the last position and arrange the remaining 4 players in 4! ways. So, the number of sequences in which the youngest player is the last is 4!. Therefore, the number of sequences in which the youngest player may not be the last is the difference between the total number of sequences and the number of sequences in which the youngest player is the last. This is equal to 120 - 4! = 120 - 24 = 96. Hence, the correct answer is (B) 96. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: There are 25 balls in a jar. You take out 5 blue balls without putting them back inside, and now the probability of pulling out a blue ball is 1/5. How many blue balls were there in the beginning? Answer Choices: (A) 12. (B) 9. (C) 8. (D) 7. (E) 6.\nA: Let's think step by step. If the probability of pulling out a blue ball is 1/5 after taking out 5 blue balls, then there must be a total of 6 blue balls in the jar. To see why, let's use the formula for probability: P(event) = number of favorable outcomes / total number of outcomes Before taking out any balls, the probability of pulling out a blue ball was: P(blue) = number of blue balls / total number of balls After taking out 5 blue balls, there are now 20 balls left in the jar. The probability of pulling out a blue ball is now 1/5: P(blue) = number of blue balls left / total number of balls left We know that the total number of balls left is 20, so we can write: 1/5 = number of blue balls left / 20 Solving for the number of blue balls left, we get: number of blue balls left = 20 / 5 = 4 But we took out 5 blue balls, so the total number of blue balls in the jar must have been: total number of blue balls = number of blue balls left + number of blue balls taken out total number of blue balls = 4 + 5 = 9 Therefore, the answer is (B) 9. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: We have 4 people and 1 chairs. In how many ways chairs can be occupy? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 86 (C) 24 (D) 14 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. If we have 4 people and only 1 chair, then only one person can sit on the chair at a time. So, we need to find the number of ways in which we can choose one person out of 4 to sit on the chair. The number of ways to choose one person out of 4 is 4. Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. None of the other options are correct as they are either too high or too low for the given scenario. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
