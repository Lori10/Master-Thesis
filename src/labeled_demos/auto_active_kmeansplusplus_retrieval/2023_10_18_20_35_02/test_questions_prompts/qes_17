If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers? Answer Choices: (A) (zy \u2013 2x) /z (B) (zy \u2013 2) /z (C) (zx \u2013 y) /(z \u2013 2)  (D) (zy \u2013 2x) /(z -2)  (E) (zy \u2013 x) /(z + 2) ",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In a class of 25 students in an examination in maths 3 students scored 95 marks each, 5 get zero each and the average of the rest was 45. What is the average of the whole class? Answer Choices: (A) A) 47 (B) B) 45.6 (C) C) 42 (D) D) 48 (E) E) 49\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total marks obtained by the class. Total marks obtained by the class = (3 students * 95 marks each) + (5 students * 0 marks each) + (17 students * 45 marks each) = 285 + 0 + 765 = 1050 Now, we can find the average of the whole class by dividing the total marks obtained by the number of students. Average of the whole class = Total marks obtained by the class / Number of students = 1050 / 25 = 42 Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 42. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If the average (arithmetic mean) of x + 1, x + 3, and x + 5 is 0, then x = Answer Choices: (A) \u20134 (B) \u20133 (C) \u20132 (D) \u20131 (E) 0\nA: Let's think step by step. The average of x + 1, x + 3, and x + 5 is (x + 1 + x + 3 + x + 5)/3 = (3x + 9)/3 = x + 3. We know that the average is 0, so x + 3 = 0. Solving for x, we get x = -3. Therefore, the answer is (B) -3. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A pupil's marks were wrongly entered as 85 instead of 45. Due to that the average marks for the class got increased by half. The number of pupils in the class is : Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 80 (C) 20 (D) 25 (E) 26\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume there were 'n' pupils in the class before the wrong entry was made. The total marks of all the pupils before the correction = n * average marks After the correction, the total marks of all the pupils = (n-1) * average marks + 85 We know that the average marks increased by half, which means: (n-1) * average marks + 85 = (n * average marks) + (0.5 * n * average marks) Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.5 * n * average marks = 85 - average marks 0.5 * n * average marks = 40 n * average marks = 80 We know that the average marks of the class is (85 + 45)/2 = 65 So, n * 65 = 80 n = 80/65 = 1.23 Since the number of pupils cannot be a decimal, we can round it up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the number of pupils in the class is 25. Hence, the answer is (D) 25. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: The average of 6 observations is 16. A new observation is included and the new average is decreased by 1. The seventh observation is? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 3 (C) 9 (D) 6 (E) 7\nA: Let's think step by step. The average of 6 observations is 16, so the sum of those 6 observations is 6 x 16 = 96. Let the seventh observation be x. When the seventh observation is included, the total number of observations becomes 7, so the new average is (96 + x)/7. We know that the new average is decreased by 1, so we can set up the equation: (96 + x)/7 = 16 - 1 Simplifying this equation, we get: (96 + x)/7 = 15 Multiplying both sides by 7, we get: 96 + x = 105 Subtracting 96 from both sides, we get: x = 9 Therefore, the seventh observation is 9. The answer is (C) 9. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
