  "test_question": "Q: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are : Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 25 (D) 26 (E) 27",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A club with a total membership of 25 has formed 3 committees, M, S and R, which have 8, 12 and 5 members respectively. If no members of committee M is on either of the other 2 committees, what is the greatest possible number of members in the club who are on none of the committees? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 7 (C) 8 (D) 10 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of members who are on the committees. M has 8 members, S has 12 members, and R has 5 members. Since no members of M are on either of the other 2 committees, we can subtract the 8 members of M from the total number of committee members: Total committee members = 8 + 12 + 5 - 8 = 17 So, there are 17 members on the committees. To find the greatest possible number of members who are on none of the committees, we need to subtract this number from the total membership of the club: Greatest possible number of members not on committees = 25 - 17 = 8 Therefore, the answer is (C) 8. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The average age of A, B and C is 28 years. If the average age of A and C is 29 years, what is the age of B in years ? Answer Choices: (A) 19 (B) 26 (C) 20 (D) 32 (E) 21\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the age of A be a, the age of B be b, and the age of C be c. We know that the average age of A, B, and C is 28, so we can write: (a + b + c)/3 = 28 Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: a + b + c = 84 We also know that the average age of A and C is 29, so we can write: (a + c)/2 = 29 Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: a + c = 58 Now we can substitute this value into the first equation to solve for b: a + b + c = 84 b = 84 - a - c b = 84 - 58 b = 26 Therefore, the age of B is 26 years. The correct answer is (B) 26. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 99 (C) 88 (D) 77 (E) 23\nA: Let's think step by step. Let Q's age be x. Then, R's age will be (x + y) and T's age will be (x - y), where y is the age difference between Q and T. Given, (x + y) + (x - y) = 50 2x = 50 x = 25 Therefore, Q's age is 25. Also, R's age is (25 + y). Given, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, (25 + y) - 25 = 25 - (25 - y) y = 12.5 Therefore, R's age is (25 + 12.5) = 37.5 The difference between R and Q's age is (37.5 - 25) = 12.5 Hence, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A person was asked to state his age in years. His reply was, \"Take my age three years hence, multiply it by 3 and then subtract three times my age three years ago and you will know how old I am.\" What was the age of the person? Answer Choices: (A) 18 years (B) 20 years (C) 24 years (D) 32 years (E) 35 years\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the person's current age be x. According to the problem, 3(x+3) - 3(x-3) = x Simplifying this equation, 3x + 9 - 3x + 9 = x 6x + 18 = x 5x = -18 x = -3.6 This is not a possible age for a person, so none of the answer choices are correct. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is No answer.\n\n\n"
