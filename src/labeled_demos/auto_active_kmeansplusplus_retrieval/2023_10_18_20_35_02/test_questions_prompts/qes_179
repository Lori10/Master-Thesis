  "test_question": "Q: An astronaut weighing 211 pounds on Earth would weigh 182 pounds on Venus. The weight of the astronaut on Venus would be approximately what percent of the astronaut\u2019s weight on Earth? Answer Choices: (A) 50% (B) 60% (C) 70% (D) 86% (E) 90%",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: From a group of 14 astronauts that includes 5 people with previous experience in space flight, a 3-person crew is to be selected so that exactly 1 person in the crew has previous experience in space flight. How many different crews of this type are possible? Answer Choices: (A) 175 (B) 190 (C) 165 (D) 180 (E) 200\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We need to choose 1 person with previous experience in space flight from the 5 available options. This can be done in 5 ways. Step 2: We need to choose 2 people without previous experience in space flight from the remaining 9 options. This can be done in 9 choose 2 ways, which is equal to (9!)/(2!7!) = 36 ways. Step 3: The total number of possible crews of this type is the product of the number of ways to perform each step. Therefore, the answer is 5 x 36 = 180. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 180. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: What percent of 9.6 kg is 28 gms ? Answer Choices: (A) 25 (B) 66 (C) 288 (D) 29 (E) 17\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 9.6 kg to grams: 9.6 kg = 9.6 x 1000 g = 9600 g Now we can set up the proportion: 28 g / 9600 g = x / 100 Solving for x: x = (28 x 100) / 9600 x = 0.29 So the answer is approximately 29%. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 29. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: In a weight-lifting competition, the total weight of Joe's two lifts was 450 pounds. If twice the weight of his first lift was 300 pounds more than the weight of his second lift, what was the weight, in pounds, of his first lift? Answer Choices: (A) 250 (B) 275 (C) 325 (D) 350 (E) 400\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the weight of Joe's first lift as 'x' pounds. According to the problem, the total weight of Joe's two lifts was 450 pounds. So, the weight of his second lift can be represented as (450 - x) pounds. Now, the problem also states that twice the weight of his first lift was 300 pounds more than the weight of his second lift. Mathematically, we can represent this as: 2x = (450 - x) + 300 Simplifying this equation, we get: 3x = 750 x = 250 Therefore, the weight of Joe's first lift was 250 pounds. Hence, the answer is (A) 250. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A boat having a length 3 m and breadth 2 m is floating on a lake. The boat sinks by 1.2 cm when a man gets on it. The mass of man is Answer Choices: (A) 72 kg (B) 60 kg (C) 72 kg (D) 96 kg (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the volume of water displaced by the boat before the man gets on it. Volume of water displaced = length x breadth x height of displacement = 3m x 2m x 0.012m (1.2 cm converted to meters) = 0.072 cubic meters Now, when the man gets on the boat, the boat sinks by 1.2 cm more. So, the new height of displacement is 0.024m (0.012m + 0.012m). Let's assume the density of water is 1000 kg/m^3. The weight of water displaced by the boat before the man gets on it = volume of water displaced x density of water = 0.072m^3 x 1000 kg/m^3 = 72 kg The weight of water displaced by the boat after the man gets on it = (volume of water displaced + additional displacement due to the man) x density of water = (3m x 2m x 0.024m) x 1000 kg/m^3 = 1.44 kg Therefore, the weight of the man = weight of water displaced before the man gets on the boat - weight of water displaced after the man gets on the boat = 72 kg - 1.44 kg = 70.56 kg So, the answer is (E) None of the above. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
