  "test_question": "Q: A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Two stations A and B are 110 km apart on a straight line. One train starts from A at 7 a.m. and travels towards B at 20 kmph. Another train starts from B at 8 a.m. and travels towards A at a speed of 25 kmph. At what time will they meet? Answer Choices: (A) 39 (B) 10 (C) 88 (D) 12 (E) 18\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much distance the first train covers before the second train starts. The first train starts at 7 a.m. and the second train starts at 8 a.m., which means the first train has a one-hour head start. In one hour, the first train covers a distance of 20 km. Now, let's assume that the two trains meet after t hours. In that case, the second train would have traveled for t - 1 hours. Let's use the formula: distance = speed x time Distance covered by the first train + Distance covered by the second train = Total distance between the two stations 20t + 25(t-1) = 110 Simplifying the equation, we get: 45t = 135 t = 3 Therefore, the two trains will meet after 3 hours. The first train started at 7 a.m., so it will meet the second train at 10 a.m. Hence, the correct answer is (B) 10. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Two goods trains each 1250 m long are running in opposite directions on parallel tracks. Their speeds are 45 km/hr and 30 km/hr respectively. Find the time taken by the slower train to pass the driver of the faster one? Answer Choices: (A) 228 (B) 278 (C) 48 (D) 27 (E) 120\nA: Let's think step by step. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds, which is 45 + 30 = 75 km/hr. We need to convert this to meters per second, so we divide by 3.6: 75 km/hr \u00f7 3.6 = 20.83 m/s Now we can find the time taken by the slower train to pass the driver of the faster one. The total distance that the slower train needs to cover is the sum of the lengths of the two trains, which is 2 \u00d7 1250 = 2500 m. Using the formula distance = speed \u00d7 time, we can find the time taken: time = distance \u00f7 speed time = 2500 m \u00f7 20.83 m/s time \u2248 120 seconds Therefore, the answer is (E) 120. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Two trains of equal lengths take 10 sec and 15 sec respectively to cross a telegraph post. If the length of each train be 120 m, in what time will they cross other travelling in opposite direction? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 12 (C) 13 (D) 14 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. The total distance covered by both trains when they cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is 240 meters. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds, since they are travelling in opposite directions. Let's call this speed \"v\". We know that the first train takes 10 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/10 = 12 m/s. Similarly, the second train takes 15 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/15 = 8 m/s. Therefore, the relative speed of the two trains is v = 12 + 8 = 20 m/s. To find the time it takes for the two trains to cross each other, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed Plugging in the values we know, we get: time = 240 / 20 = 12 seconds Therefore, the answer is (B) 12. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Calculate the time it will take for a train that is 120 meter long to pass a bridge of 160 meter length, if the speed of the train is 40 km/hour ? Answer Choices: (A) 21.2 seconds (B) 25.2 seconds (C) 29.2 seconds (D) 35.2 seconds (E) 11.2 seconds\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/hour to m/s. 40 km/hour = (40 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 11.11 m/s (approx) Now, we need to find the total distance that the train will cover while passing the bridge. Total distance = length of train + length of bridge = 120 + 160 = 280 meters Next, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed time = 280 / 11.11 = 25.21 seconds (approx) Therefore, the answer is (B) 25.2 seconds. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
