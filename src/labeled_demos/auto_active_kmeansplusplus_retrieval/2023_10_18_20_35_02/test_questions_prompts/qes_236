  "test_question": "Q: If a man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph, then the man's rate along the current is: Answer Choices: (A) 15 kmph (B) 6 kmph (C) 12 kmph (D) 14 kmph (E) 6 kmph",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A man can row his boat with the stream at 18 km/h and against the stream in 8 km/h. The man's rate is? Answer Choices: (A) 5 kmph (B) 2 kmph (C) 7 kmph (D) 8 kmph (E) 3 kmph\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the speed of the stream be x km/h and the speed of the man be y km/h. When the man rows with the stream, his effective speed is (y + x) km/h. When the man rows against the stream, his effective speed is (y - x) km/h. We are given that: (y + x) = 18 km/h (y - x) = 8 km/h Adding the two equations, we get: 2y = 26 km/h y = 13 km/h Therefore, the man's rate is 13 km/h. The answer is not in the given options. Hence, the answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A person can swim in still water at 8 km/h. If the speed of water 4 km/h, how many hours will the man take to swim back against the current for 8km? Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 6 (E) 7\nA: Let's think step by step. The speed of the person in still water is 8 km/h. The speed of the water is 4 km/h. When the person swims with the current, their effective speed is the sum of their speed in still water and the speed of the water. So, their effective speed is 8 + 4 = 12 km/h. When the person swims against the current, their effective speed is the difference between their speed in still water and the speed of the water. So, their effective speed is 8 - 4 = 4 km/h. We know that the person needs to swim 8 km against the current. To find how long it will take, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed In this case, the distance is 8 km and the speed is 4 km/h. So: time = 8 / 4 = 2 Therefore, the person will take 2 hours to swim back against the current for 8 km. The correct answer is (A) 2. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A man whose speed is 3.5 kmph in still water rows to a certain upstream point and back to the starting point in a river which flows at 1.5 kmph, find his average speed for the total journey? Answer Choices: (A) 2.0 (B) 2.5 (C) 3.0 (D) 2.1 (E) 4.0\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. Let the distance between the starting point and the upstream point be 'd' km. Speed of the man in upstream = (3.5 - 1.5) kmph = 2 kmph (as the river flows at 1.5 kmph in the opposite direction) Time taken by the man to row to the upstream point = d/2 kmph Speed of the man in downstream = (3.5 + 1.5) kmph = 5 kmph (as the river flows at 1.5 kmph in the same direction) Time taken by the man to row back to the starting point = d/5 kmph Total time taken by the man for the entire journey = (d/2) + (d/5) = (5d + 2d)/10 = (7d/10) hours Total distance covered by the man in the entire journey = 2d km (as he rows to the upstream point and back to the starting point) Average speed for the entire journey = Total distance covered / Total time taken = 2d / (7d/10) = (20/7) kmph = 2.86 kmph (approx.) Therefore, the correct answer is (None of the above). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The speed of a boat in still water is 60kmph and the speed of the current is 30kmph. Find the speed downstream and upstream? Answer Choices: (A) 40, 68 kmph (B) 40, 30 kmph (C) 90, 60 kmph (D) 40, 60 kmph (E) 90, 30 kmph\nA: Let's think step by step. The speed downstream is the speed of the boat in still water plus the speed of the current, which is 60 + 30 = 90 kmph. The speed upstream is the speed of the boat in still water minus the speed of the current, which is 60 - 30 = 30 kmph. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 90, 30 kmph. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
