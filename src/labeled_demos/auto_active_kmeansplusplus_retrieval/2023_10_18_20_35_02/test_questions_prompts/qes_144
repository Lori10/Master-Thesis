  "formatted_prompt": "Q: How many ways can 3 friends be arranged around a circular dinner table? Answer Choices: (A) A) 16 (B) B) 2 (C) C) 96 (D) D) 120 (E) E) 720\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We have 3 friends who need to be arranged around a circular dinner table. Step 1: Choose one friend to sit at the \"top\" of the table. This can be done in 3 ways. Step 2: Arrange the remaining 2 friends in the remaining 2 seats. This can be done in 2 ways. Step 3: Since the table is circular, we need to divide by the number of rotations. In other words, we need to divide by 3 because there are 3 ways to rotate the table and get the same arrangement. So the total number of arrangements is (3 x 2) / 3 = 2. Therefore, the answer is (B) 2. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Six students are equally divided into 3 groups, then, the three groups were assigned to three different topics. How many different arrangements Q are possible? Answer Choices: (A)  30 (B)  60 (C)  90 (D)  180 (E)  540\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We need to find the number of ways to divide 6 students equally into 3 groups. This can be done using combinations. We need to choose 2 students from 6 for the first group, then 2 students from the remaining 4 for the second group, and the remaining 2 students will be in the third group. The number of ways to choose 2 students from 6 is 6C2 = 15. The number of ways to choose 2 students from 4 is 4C2 = 6. So the total number of ways to divide 6 students equally into 3 groups is 15 x 6 = 90. Step 2: We need to find the number of ways to assign the 3 groups to 3 different topics. This can be done in 3! = 6 ways. Step 3: We need to find the total number of arrangements Q by multiplying the results of step 1 and step 2. Q = 90 x 6 = 540. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 540. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A student must answer 7 out of 10 questions on an examination. If at least 3 of the first 5 questions must be answered, how many possible combinations of 7 questions are available to the student?\n. Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 80 (C) 110 (D) 220 (E) 360\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that the student must answer 7 out of 10 questions, so we need to find the number of ways to choose 7 questions out of 10. This can be calculated using the combination formula: 10C7 = 10! / (7! * 3!) = 120 So there are 120 possible combinations of 7 questions. Step 2: We also know that at least 3 of the first 5 questions must be answered. This means that the student can either answer 3, 4, or 5 questions from the first 5. Step 3: We need to find the number of ways to choose the remaining questions from the remaining 5. This can be calculated using the combination formula: 5C4 + 5C3 + 5C2 = 5! / (4! * 1!) + 5! / (3! * 2!) + 5! / (2! * 3!) = 5 + 10 + 10 = 25 So there are 25 ways to choose the remaining questions. Step 4: We can now find the total number of possible combinations by multiplying the results from step 2 and step 3: (3C3 * 5C4) + (4C3 * 5C3) + (5C3 * 5C2) = (1 * 5) + (4 * 10) + (10 * 10) = 5 + 40 + 100 = 145 Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the correct answer of 145. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A certain football coach allows his quarterback to call three plays in a row. If the quarterback can choose from 3 passing plays, 4 running plays, and 2 trick plays, how many different N arrangements of plays can be run, if the same play can\u2019t be run more than once? Answer Choices: (A) 24 (B) 125 (C) 243 (D) 504 (E) 729\nA: Let's think step by step. First, the quarterback can choose from 3 passing plays, then 4 running plays, and finally 2 trick plays. Using the multiplication principle, we can find the total number of arrangements by multiplying the number of choices for each step: 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 Therefore, the answer is (A) 24. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
