  "test_question": "Q: A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 240 (C) 30 (D) 60 (E) 120",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: James took a 3-hour bike ride. In the second hour he travlled 18 miles, which was 20 percent farther than he traveled the first hour. If he traveled 25 percent farther in the third hour than he did in the second hour, how many miles did jose travel during the entire ride? Answer Choices: (A) 54.0 (B) 54.9 (C) 55.5 (D) 57.0 (E) 63.0\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how far James traveled in the first hour. We know that in the second hour he traveled 20% farther than in the first hour, so we can set up the equation: 18 = 1.2x where x is the distance James traveled in the first hour. Solving for x, we get: x = 15 Next, we need to find out how far James traveled in the third hour. We know that in the third hour he traveled 25% farther than in the second hour, so we can set up the equation: d = 1.25(18) where d is the distance James traveled in the third hour. Solving for d, we get: d = 22.5 Finally, we can add up the distances traveled in each hour to find the total distance traveled: total distance = 15 + 18 + 22.5 = 55.5 Therefore, the answer is (C) 55.5. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If a truck is traveling at a constant rate of 54 kilometers per hour, how many seconds will it take the truck to travel a distance of 600 meters? (1 kilometer = 1000 meters) Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 24 (C) 30 (D) 36 (E) 40\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the truck from kilometers per hour to meters per second since the distance given is in meters. 54 kilometers per hour = 54,000 meters per hour (since 1 kilometer = 1000 meters) = 15 meters per second (since 1 hour = 3600 seconds) Now, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time Plugging in the values we have: 600 meters = 15 meters per second x time Solving for time: time = 600 meters / 15 meters per second time = 40 seconds Therefore, the answer is (E) 40. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: The diameter of the driving wheel of a bus is 120 m. How many revolution, per minute must the wheel make in order to keep a speed of 60 kmph approximately Answer Choices: (A) 245 (B) 257 (C) 262 (D) 265 (E) 275\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed from km/h to m/min. 60 km/h = 60,000 m/h = 1,000 m/min Next, we need to find the circumference of the wheel using the formula: Circumference = \u03c0 \u00d7 diameter Circumference = \u03c0 \u00d7 120 m Circumference \u2248 376.99 m Finally, we can use the formula: Speed = circumference \u00d7 revolutions per minute 1,000 m/min = 376.99 m \u00d7 revolutions per minute Revolutions per minute \u2248 2.65 Therefore, the answer is (D) 265. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Dylan is on a road trip. He planned on arriving at his destination, 2150 miles away, in 6 days. In the first day, he traveled 310 miles. In the next three days, he travels 1140 miles. How many miles, on average, does Dylan need to travel in the next two days to reach his destination? Answer Choices: (A) 330 (B) 340 (C) 350 (D) 360 (E) 370\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many miles Dylan has left to travel after the first four days: 2150 miles - 310 miles (day 1) - 1140 miles (days 2-4) = 700 miles Now we need to find out how many miles Dylan needs to travel on average in the next two days to cover the remaining 700 miles. We can use the formula: average speed = total distance / total time We know the total distance (700 miles) and the total time (2 days), so we can plug those values in: average speed = 700 miles / 2 days = 350 miles per day Therefore, the answer is (C) 350. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
