  "test_question": "Q: A rope 20 meters long is cut into two pieces. If the length of one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the other, what is the length, in meters, of the longer piece of rope? Answer Choices: (A) 7.5 (B) 8.9 (C) 9.9 (D) 11.5 (E) 11.7",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A rectangular plot measuring 90 metres by 50 metres is to be enclosed by wire fencing. If the poles of the fence are kept 5 metres apart, how many poles will be needed ? Answer Choices: (A) 55 (B) 56 (C) 57 (D) 58 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular plot. Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 2(90 + 50) = 280 meters Next, we need to find the number of poles required if they are kept 5 meters apart. We can divide the perimeter by the distance between two poles: Number of poles = Perimeter / Distance between two poles Number of poles = 280 / 5 = 56 Therefore, the answer is (B) 56. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: The greatest possible length which can be used to measure exactly the length 8m ,2m 15cm, 8m 90 cm is? Answer Choices: (A) 25cm (B) 101cm (C) 56cm (D) 42cm (E) 5cm\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the given lengths. 8m = 800cm 2m 15cm = 215cm 8m 90cm = 890cm Now, we need to find the GCF of 800, 215, and 890. The prime factorization of 800 is 2^5 x 5^2. The prime factorization of 215 is 5 x 43. The prime factorization of 890 is 2 x 5 x 89. The GCF of these three numbers is 5, since it is the only factor they have in common. Therefore, the greatest possible length that can be used to measure exactly 8m, 2m 15cm, and 8m 90cm is 5cm. The answer is (E) 5cm. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A man walking at a rate of 5km/hr crosses a bridge in 15 minutes. The length of the bridge is? Answer Choices: (A) 1250m (B) 1310m (C) 1500m (D) 1000m (E) 1195m\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the man's speed from km/hr to m/min since the answer choices are in meters. 5 km/hr = 5000 m/hr (since 1 km = 1000 m) 5000 m/hr = 83.33 m/min (since 1 hr = 60 min) Next, we need to use the formula: distance = speed x time We know the speed is 83.33 m/min and the time is 15 minutes. Let's plug those values in: distance = 83.33 m/min x 15 min distance = 1250 m Therefore, the length of the bridge is 1250m. The correct answer is (A) 1250m. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A man traveled a total distance of 1800 km. He traveled one-third of the whole trip by plane and the distance traveled by train is three-fifth of the distance traveled by bus. If he traveled by train, plane and bus, then find the distance traveled by bus? Answer Choices: (A) 450 km (B) 850 km (C) 1200 km (D) 750 km (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the distance traveled by plane be x km. Then, the distance traveled by train is (3/5)(2/3)(1800-x) km (since he traveled one-third of the whole trip by plane). The distance traveled by bus is the remaining distance, which is 1800 - x - (3/5)(2/3)(1800-x) km. Simplifying this expression, we get: 1800 - x - (3/5)(2/3)(1800-x) = 1800 - x - (2/5)(1800-x) = 1800 - x - (3600/5 - 2x/5) = (3x/5) + 720 We want to find the value of this expression that is equal to the distance traveled by bus. Looking at the answer choices, we see that (A) 450 km is too small, (B) 850 km is too large, and (C) 1200 km is too large. So, we try (D) 750 km: (3x/5) + 720 = 750 3x/5 = 30 x = 50 Therefore, the distance traveled by plane is 50 km, the distance traveled by train is (3/5)(2/3)(1800-50) = 480 km, and the distance traveled by bus is 1800 - 50 - 480 = 1270 km. None of the answer choices match this value, so the correct answer is (E) None of these. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
