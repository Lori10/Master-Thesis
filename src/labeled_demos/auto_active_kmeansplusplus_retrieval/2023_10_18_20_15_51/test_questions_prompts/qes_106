  "test_question": "Q: If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent? Answer Choices: (A) 30% (B) 40% (C) 20% (D) 10% (E) 5%",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The output of a factory was increased by 10% to keep up with rising demand. To handle the holiday rush, this new output was increased by 25%. By approximately what percent would the output now have to be decreased in order to restore the original output? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 24% (C) 30% (D) 27% (E) 79%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the original output was 100 units. After the first increase of 10%, the new output became 110 units. After the second increase of 25%, the new output became 137.5 units (110 + 0.25*110). To restore the original output of 100 units, we need to decrease the current output of 137.5 units by a certain percentage. The percentage decrease can be calculated as follows: Percentage decrease = ((New value - Original value) / New value) * 100 = ((137.5 - 100) / 137.5) * 100 = 27.27% Therefore, the output now has to be decreased by approximately 27% to restore the original output. The closest answer choice is (D) 27%. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Which of the following values is the greatest Answer Choices: (A) a)  30% of 89 (B) b)  22% of 78 (C) c)  33% of 67 (D) d)  44% of 56 (E) e)  55% of 45\nA: Let's think step by step. A) 30% of 89 = 0.3 x 89 = 26.7 B) 22% of 78 = 0.22 x 78 = 17.16 C) 33% of 67 = 0.33 x 67 = 22.11 D) 44% of 56 = 0.44 x 56 = 24.64 E) 55% of 45 = 0.55 x 45 = 24.75 Therefore, the greatest value is option (E) 55% of 45. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In a game of billiards, A can give B 20 points in 60 and he can give C 30 points in 60. How many points can B give C in a game of 120? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 77 (C) 45 (D) 18 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many points A can give B in a game of 120. We can use the ratio of 20 points in 60 to find out how many points A can give B in 120. 20 points in 60 minutes is equivalent to (20/60) = 1/3 points per minute. Therefore, in 120 minutes, A can give B (1/3 x 120) = 40 points. Now, we need to find out how many points A can give C in a game of 120. Using the same method as above, we get: 30 points in 60 minutes is equivalent to (30/60) = 1/2 points per minute. Therefore, in 120 minutes, A can give C (1/2 x 120) = 60 points. Now, we need to find out how many points B can give C in a game of 120. Let's assume that B can give C x points in 120 minutes. In 120 minutes, A can give B 40 points and A can give C 60 points. Therefore, B can give C (60 - 40) = 20 points in 120 minutes. Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match our calculation. The correct answer is 20. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: When 1/10 percent of 2,000 is subtracted from 1/10 of 2,000, the difference is Answer Choices: (A)  0 (B)  198 (C)  450 (D)  495 (E)  500\nA: Let's think step by step. 1/10 percent of 2,000 is equal to (1/10)*(1/100)*2,000 = 2. 1/10 of 2,000 is equal to 200. So, when we subtract 2 from 200, we get 198. Therefore, the answer is (B) 198. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
