  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If 288 is divided into four parts proportional to 5, 7, 4, 8 then the smallest part is : Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 44 (C) 20 (D) 48 (E) 42\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total proportion: 5 + 7 + 4 + 8 = 24 Next, we need to find the proportion of each part: 5/24, 7/24, 4/24, 8/24 Simplifying these fractions, we get: 5/24, 7/24, 1/6, 1/3 Now, we can find the value of each part by multiplying its proportion by the total value: 5/24 x 288 = 60 7/24 x 288 = 84 1/6 x 288 = 48 1/3 x 288 = 96 Therefore, the smallest part is 48, which corresponds to the proportion of 1/6. The correct answer is (D) 48. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: 54.327 \u00d7 357.2 \u00d7 0.0057 is the same as : Answer Choices: (A) 5.4327 \u00d7 3.572 \u00d7 5.7 (B) 5.4327 \u00d7 3.572 \u00d7 0.57 (C) 5.4327 \u00d7 3.572 \u00d7 0.0000057 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can multiply 54.327 and 357.2 to get 19416.8104. Then, we can multiply that result by 0.0057 to get 110.8345248. Therefore, the answer is (C) 5.4327 \u00d7 3.572 \u00d7 0.0000057. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: What is the tenth digit to the right of the decimal point, in the decimal expansion of (1/5)^10 Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 2 (C) 4 (D) 6 (E) 8\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step. First, we need to find the decimal expansion of (1/5)^10. We can do this by repeatedly dividing 1 by 5, 10 times: (1/5)^1 = 0.2 (1/5)^2 = 0.04 (1/5)^3 = 0.008 (1/5)^4 = 0.0016 (1/5)^5 = 0.00032 (1/5)^6 = 0.000064 (1/5)^7 = 0.0000128 (1/5)^8 = 0.00000256 (1/5)^9 = 0.000000512 (1/5)^10 = 0.0000001024 Next, we need to find the tenth digit to the right of the decimal point in this decimal expansion. To do this, we count 10 digits to the right of the decimal point: 0.0000001024 ^ The digit we land on is 4, so the answer is (C) 4. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The value of (0.2\u00d70.2+0.01) (0.1\u00d70.1+0.02)-1 is equal to Answer Choices: (A) 5/3 (B) 9/5 (C) 41/4 (D) 41/12 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can simplify the expression inside the parentheses: (0.2\u00d70.2+0.01) = 0.041 (0.1\u00d70.1+0.02) = 0.012 So now we have: 0.041 \u00d7 0.012 - 1 Simplifying further: 0.000492 - 1 -0.999508 None of the answer choices match this result, so the answer is: (E) None The answer is E.\n\n\n"
