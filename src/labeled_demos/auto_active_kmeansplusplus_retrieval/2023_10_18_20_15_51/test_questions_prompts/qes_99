  "formatted_prompt": "Q: 12+6=792\n10+2=110\n1+9=9\n2+7=16\n11+4=??\nSolve it? Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 190 (D) 160 (E) 154\nA: Let's think step by step. In the first equation, 12+6=18. In the second equation, 10+2=12. In the third equation, 1+9=10. In the fourth equation, 2+7=9. To solve the fifth equation, we need to find a pattern in the given equations. We can see that the sum of the two numbers in each equation is multiplied by the second number to get the answer. For example, in the first equation, (12+6) x 6 = 108, which is the answer. Using the same pattern, we can solve the fifth equation: (11+4) x 4 = 60. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: 5 persons A,B,C,D and E occupy seats in a row at random. What is the probability that A and B sit next to each other ? Answer Choices: (A) 3/5 (B) 2/5 (C) 1/5 (D) 8/5 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 5 people, so there are 5! = 120 ways to arrange them in a row. Now, let's consider A and B as a single entity, AB. Then, there are 4! = 24 ways to arrange the entities AB, C, D, and E in a row. However, within the entity AB, there are 2! = 2 ways to arrange A and B. So, there are 2 x 4! = 48 ways for A and B to sit next to each other. Therefore, the probability of A and B sitting next to each other is 48/120 = 2/5. The correct answer is (B) 2/5. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In how many different orders can the people Alice, Benjamin, Charlene, David, Elaine, Frederick, Gale, and Harold be standing on line if each of Alice, Benjamin, Charlene must be on the line before each of Frederick, Gale, and Harold? Answer Choices: (A) 1,008 (B) 1,296 (C) 1,512 (D) 2,016 (E) 2,268\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to arrange Alice, Benjamin, and Charlene in a line. This can be done in 3! = 6 ways. Next, we need to arrange Frederick, Gale, and Harold in a line. This can also be done in 3! = 6 ways. Now, we have 5 people left to arrange: David, Elaine, and the 3 groups of 3 people (ABC, FGH). We can think of these 5 people as 5 slots that need to be filled. The first slot can be filled by any of the 8 people. The second slot can be filled by any of the remaining 7 people. The third slot can be filled by any of the remaining 6 people. The fourth slot can be filled by any of the remaining 5 people. The fifth slot can be filled by any of the remaining 4 people. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange all 8 people is: 6 x 6 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 = 1,296 So the answer is (B) 1,296. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: We have 4 people and 1 chairs. In how many ways chairs can be occupy? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 86 (C) 24 (D) 14 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. If we have 4 people and only 1 chair, then only one person can sit on the chair at a time. So, we need to find the number of ways in which we can choose one person out of 4 to sit on the chair. The number of ways to choose one person out of 4 is 4. Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. None of the other options are correct as they are either too high or too low for the given scenario. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
