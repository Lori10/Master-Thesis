  "formatted_prompt": "Q: We have 4 people and 1 chairs. In how many ways chairs can be occupy? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 86 (C) 24 (D) 14 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. If we have 4 people and only 1 chair, then only one person can sit on the chair at a time. So, we need to find the number of ways in which we can choose one person out of 4 to sit on the chair. The number of ways to choose one person out of 4 is 4. Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. None of the other options are correct as they are either too high or too low for the given scenario. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A man traveled a total distance of 1800 km. He traveled one-third of the whole trip by plane and the distance traveled by train is three-fifth of the distance traveled by bus. If he traveled by train, plane and bus, then find the distance traveled by bus? Answer Choices: (A) 450 km (B) 850 km (C) 1200 km (D) 750 km (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the distance traveled by plane be x km. Then, the distance traveled by train is (3/5)(2/3)(1800-x) km (since he traveled one-third of the whole trip by plane). The distance traveled by bus is the remaining distance, which is 1800 - x - (3/5)(2/3)(1800-x) km. Simplifying this expression, we get: 1800 - x - (3/5)(2/3)(1800-x) = 1800 - x - (2/5)(1800-x) = 1800 - x - (3600/5 - 2x/5) = (3x/5) + 720 We want to find the value of this expression that is equal to the distance traveled by bus. Looking at the answer choices, we see that (A) 450 km is too small, (B) 850 km is too large, and (C) 1200 km is too large. So, we try (D) 750 km: (3x/5) + 720 = 750 3x/5 = 30 x = 50 Therefore, the distance traveled by plane is 50 km, the distance traveled by train is (3/5)(2/3)(1800-50) = 480 km, and the distance traveled by bus is 1800 - 50 - 480 = 1270 km. None of the answer choices match this value, so the correct answer is (E) None of these. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A certain football coach allows his quarterback to call three plays in a row. If the quarterback can choose from 3 passing plays, 4 running plays, and 2 trick plays, how many different N arrangements of plays can be run, if the same play can\u2019t be run more than once? Answer Choices: (A) 24 (B) 125 (C) 243 (D) 504 (E) 729\nA: Let's think step by step. First, the quarterback can choose from 3 passing plays, then 4 running plays, and finally 2 trick plays. Using the multiplication principle, we can find the total number of arrangements by multiplying the number of choices for each step: 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 Therefore, the answer is (A) 24. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Using all the letters of the word \"NOKIA\", how many words can be formed, which begin with N and end with A? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 24 (C) 62 (D) 78 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to choose the first letter as N, which leaves us with four letters: O, K, I, and A. Next, we need to arrange these four letters in different ways to form words. This can be done in 4! = 24 ways. Finally, we need to ensure that each word ends with A. Out of the four remaining letters, only one is A. Therefore, there is only one way to choose the last letter. So, the total number of words that can be formed is 24 x 1 = 24. Therefore, the answer is (B) 24. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
