  "test_question": "Q: Two cars start at the same time from opposite ends of a highway that is 50 miles long. One car is riding at 12 mph and the second car is riding at 13 mph. How long after they begin will they meet? Answer Choices: (A)  1 (B)  1.25 (C)  1.50 (D)  1.75 (E)  2",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: What would happen in the previous question if both A and B had started at point P. Answer Choices: (A) 800 Km (B) 600 Km (C) 1000 Km (D) 350 Km (E) 250 Km\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that A travels at a speed of 50 km/h and B travels at a speed of 40 km/h. If they both started at point P, they would be moving in opposite directions. Let's say they meet after x hours. In that time, A would have traveled 50x km and B would have traveled 40x km. We also know that the distance between A and B is 600 km. So, we can set up the equation: 50x + 40x = 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 90x = 600 x = 6.67 hours Now that we know they meet after 6.67 hours, we can find out how far each of them has traveled: A: 50 km/h x 6.67 h = 333.33 km B: 40 km/h x 6.67 h = 266.67 km The total distance they have traveled is: 333.33 km + 266.67 km = 600 km Therefore, the answer is (B) 600 km. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Two trains of equal lengths take 10 sec and 15 sec respectively to cross a telegraph post. If the length of each train be 120 m, in what time will they cross other travelling in opposite direction? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 12 (C) 13 (D) 14 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. The total distance covered by both trains when they cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is 240 meters. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds, since they are travelling in opposite directions. Let's call this speed \"v\". We know that the first train takes 10 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/10 = 12 m/s. Similarly, the second train takes 15 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/15 = 8 m/s. Therefore, the relative speed of the two trains is v = 12 + 8 = 20 m/s. To find the time it takes for the two trains to cross each other, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed Plugging in the values we know, we get: time = 240 / 20 = 12 seconds Therefore, the answer is (B) 12. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A car covers a distance of 624 km in 2 2/5 hours. Find its speed? Answer Choices: (A) 104 kmph (B) 194 kmph (C) 109 kmph (D) 260 kmph (E) 271 kmph\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that speed = distance/time. Here, the distance covered by the car is 624 km and the time taken is 2 2/5 hours. To convert the mixed fraction to an improper fraction, we can multiply the whole number (2) by the denominator (5) and add the numerator (2) to get 12/5. So, time taken = 12/5 hours. Now, we can substitute these values in the formula: Speed = distance/time Speed = 624/(12/5) Speed = 624 * 5/12 Speed = 260 kmph Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 260 kmph. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A thief steals at a car at 4.30 p.m. and drives it at 60 km/hr. The theft is discovered at 3 p.m. and the owner sets off in another car at 75 km/hr. When will he overtake the thief? Answer Choices: (A) 1 p.m (B) 3 p.m (C) 4 p.m (D) 5 p.m (E) 7 p.m\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much time the thief has been driving before the owner sets off. The theft was discovered at 3 p.m. and the thief stole the car at 4.30 p.m., so the thief has been driving for 1.5 hours. Next, we need to find out how far the thief has traveled in 1.5 hours at 60 km/hr. Distance = Speed x Time, so distance = 60 km/hr x 1.5 hr = 90 km. Now, we can set up an equation to find out when the owner will overtake the thief. Let t be the time it takes for the owner to catch up to the thief. The distance the owner travels is the same as the distance the thief travels plus the 90 km the thief traveled before the owner set off. So: 75t = 90 + 60t Simplifying this equation, we get: 15t = 90 t = 6 So it will take the owner 6 hours to catch up to the thief. If the theft was discovered at 3 p.m., then the owner will catch up to the thief at 9 p.m. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
