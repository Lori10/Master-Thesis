  "test_question": "Q: An electric pole, 14 metres high, casts a shadow of 10 metres. Find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions. Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 22 (C) 20 (D) 23 (E) 24",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A rectangular plot measuring 90 metres by 50 metres is to be enclosed by wire fencing. If the poles of the fence are kept 5 metres apart, how many poles will be needed ? Answer Choices: (A) 55 (B) 56 (C) 57 (D) 58 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular plot. Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 2(90 + 50) = 280 meters Next, we need to find the number of poles required if they are kept 5 meters apart. We can divide the perimeter by the distance between two poles: Number of poles = Perimeter / Distance between two poles Number of poles = 280 / 5 = 56 Therefore, the answer is (B) 56. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: An object thrown directly upward is at a height of h feet after t seconds, where h = -15 (t-2)^2 + 150. At what height, in feet, is the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 90 (C) 124 (D) 132 (E) 140\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the maximum height of the object. We can do this by finding the vertex of the quadratic equation h = -15(t-2)^2 + 150. The vertex of a quadratic equation in the form of h = a(t-b)^2 + c is (b, c). In this case, the vertex is (2, 150). This means that the object reaches its maximum height of 150 feet after 2 seconds. Next, we need to find the height of the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height. We can do this by plugging in t = 4 (2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height) into the equation h = -15(t-2)^2 + 150. h = -15(4-2)^2 + 150 h = -15(2)^2 + 150 h = -60 + 150 h = 90 Therefore, the height of the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height is 90 feet. The correct answer is (B) 90. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A 25 cm wide path is to be made around a circular garden having a diameter of 4 meters. Approximate area of the path is square meters is? Answer Choices: (A) 3.34 sq m (B) 2.98 sq m (C) 9.98 sq m (D) 1.98 sq m (E) 3.78 sq m\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the radius of the circular garden. We know that the diameter is 4 meters, so the radius is half of that, which is 2 meters. Next, we need to find the radius of the garden plus the width of the path. The width of the path is given as 25 cm, which is 0.25 meters. So, the radius of the garden plus the width of the path is 2 + 0.25 = 2.25 meters. Now, we can find the area of the path by subtracting the area of the garden from the area of the larger circle with radius 2.25 meters. The area of the garden is \u03c0r^2 = \u03c0(2)^2 = 4\u03c0 square meters. The area of the larger circle is \u03c0(2.25)^2 = 5.06\u03c0 square meters. So, the area of the path is 5.06\u03c0 - 4\u03c0 = 1.06\u03c0 square meters. Finally, we can approximate this value using 3.14 as an approximation for \u03c0. So, the area of the path is approximately 1.06 x 3.14 = 3.3244 square meters, which is closest to answer choice (A) 3.34 sq m. Therefore, the answer is (A) 3.34 sq m. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Two trains of equal lengths take 10 sec and 15 sec respectively to cross a telegraph post. If the length of each train be 120 m, in what time will they cross other travelling in opposite direction? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 12 (C) 13 (D) 14 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. The total distance covered by both trains when they cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is 240 meters. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds, since they are travelling in opposite directions. Let's call this speed \"v\". We know that the first train takes 10 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/10 = 12 m/s. Similarly, the second train takes 15 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/15 = 8 m/s. Therefore, the relative speed of the two trains is v = 12 + 8 = 20 m/s. To find the time it takes for the two trains to cross each other, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed Plugging in the values we know, we get: time = 240 / 20 = 12 seconds Therefore, the answer is (B) 12. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
