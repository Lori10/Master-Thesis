  "test_question": "Q: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? Answer Choices: (A) 277 (B) 288 (C) 200 (D) 277 (E) 168",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The average age of students of a class is 15.8 years. The average age of boys in the class is 16.4 years and that of the girls is 15.4 years. The ration of the number of boys to the number of girls in the class is: Answer Choices: (A) 2:5 (B) 2:3 (C) 2:4 (D) 2:1 (E) 2:9\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the number of boys in the class be 'b' and the number of girls be 'g'. We know that the average age of the class is 15.8 years. So, the total age of all the students in the class = 15.8 x (b+g) We also know that the average age of boys in the class is 16.4 years. So, the total age of all the boys in the class = 16.4 x b Similarly, the total age of all the girls in the class = 15.4 x g Now, we can form an equation using the above information: (16.4 x b + 15.4 x g) / (b+g) = 15.8 Simplifying this equation, we get: 16.4b + 15.4g = 15.8b + 15.8g 0.6b = 0.4g b/g = 2/3 Therefore, the ratio of the number of boys to the number of girls in the class is 2:3. Hence, the correct answer is option (B) 2:3. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: From a group of boys and girls, 15 girls leave. They are then left 2 boys for each girl. After this, 54 boys leave. There are then 5 girls for each boy. Find the number of girls in the beginning Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 10 (C) 30 (D) 50 (E) 45\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Let's assume the number of girls in the beginning is 'g' and the number of boys is 'b'. Step 2: \"From a group of boys and girls, 15 girls leave.\" This means there are now 'g-15' girls and 'b' boys. Step 3: \"They are then left 2 boys for each girl.\" This means the number of boys is twice the number of girls. So, we can write an equation: b = 2(g-15). Step 4: \"After this, 54 boys leave.\" This means there are now 'g-15' girls and 'b-54' boys. Step 5: \"There are then 5 girls for each boy.\" This means the number of girls is five times the number of boys. So, we can write another equation: g-15 = 5(b-54). Step 6: Now we have two equations with two variables. We can solve for 'g'. b = 2(g-15) --> b = 2g - 30 g-15 = 5(b-54) --> g-15 = 5(2g-84) --> g-15 = 10g - 420 --> 9g = 405 --> g = 45 Step 7: The number of girls in the beginning is 45. Therefore, the answer is (E) 45. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: We have 4 people and 1 chairs. In how many ways chairs can be occupy? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 86 (C) 24 (D) 14 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. If we have 4 people and only 1 chair, then only one person can sit on the chair at a time. So, we need to find the number of ways in which we can choose one person out of 4 to sit on the chair. The number of ways to choose one person out of 4 is 4. Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. None of the other options are correct as they are either too high or too low for the given scenario. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: If there are 9 pairs of twins, and a committee will be formed with 3 members. In how many ways this committee formed in a way that no siblings in a group? Answer Choices: (A) 632 (B) 672 (C) 756 (D) 744 (E) 740\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We have 18 individuals (9 pairs of twins). Step 2: We need to choose 3 individuals for the committee. Step 3: We cannot choose any siblings in the same group. Step 4: To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Step 5: First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 individuals from 18, which is 18C3 = 816. Step 6: Next, we calculate the number of ways to choose 3 individuals with at least one pair of siblings in the same group. Step 7: There are 9 ways to choose one pair of siblings and one additional individual from the remaining 16 individuals (9*16 = 144). Step 8: There are 36 ways to choose two pairs of siblings (9C2) and one additional individual from the remaining 15 individuals (15 = 15). Step 9: However, we have counted the case where all three individuals are siblings twice, so we need to subtract this case once. Step 10: There are 9 ways to choose three siblings from the 9 pairs of twins (9C3). Step 11: Therefore, the number of ways to choose 3 individuals with at least one pair of siblings in the same group is 144 + 36 - 9 = 171. Step 12: Finally, we subtract this number from the total number of ways to choose 3 individuals to get the number of ways to choose 3 individuals with no siblings in the same group: 816 - 171 = 645. Step 13: None of the answer choices match our answer, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
