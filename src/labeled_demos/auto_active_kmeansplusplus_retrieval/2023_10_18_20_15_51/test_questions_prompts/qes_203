  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If doubling a number and adding 20 to the result gives the same answer as multiplying the number by 8 and taking away 4 from the product, the number is Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 4 (D) 5 (E) 6\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the number is x. According to the problem, we can create the following equation: 2x + 20 = 8x - 4 Now we can solve for x: 2x + 20 = 8x - 4 Add 4 to both sides: 2x + 24 = 8x Subtract 2x from both sides: 24 = 6x Divide both sides by 6: x = 4 Therefore, the answer is (C) 4. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If (x^2 + 1)y=8, which of the following is not a possible value for y? Answer Choices: (A) 8/2 (B) 2/5 (C) 18/3 (D) 3 (E) 17/2\nA: Let's think step by step. We are given the equation (x^2 + 1)y = 8. To find the possible values of y, we need to solve for y. Dividing both sides by (x^2 + 1), we get: y = 8/(x^2 + 1) So, any value of y that makes the denominator (x^2 + 1) equal to zero is not possible, as division by zero is undefined. The denominator (x^2 + 1) is always positive, so it can never be zero. Therefore, all the given answer choices are possible values of y. Hence, the answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: x + y = 19 , and x + 3y = 1. Find the value of x + 2y Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 18 (C) 11 (D) 10 (E) 5\nA: Let's think step by step. We have two equations: x + y = 19 (equation 1) x + 3y = 1 (equation 2) We need to find the value of x + 2y. We can solve for x in equation 1: x = 19 - y Substitute this value of x in equation 2: (19 - y) + 3y = 1 Simplifying this equation, we get: 2y = -18 y = -9 Now, substitute this value of y in equation 1 to find x: x + (-9) = 19 x = 28 Therefore, x + 2y = 28 + 2(-9) = 10 Hence, the answer is (D) 10. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Divide 71 into 2 parts such that 1 part exceeds the other by 8. What are the 2 no.'s in that part? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 29 (C) 30 (D) 31 (E) 33\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that one part is x and the other part is y. According to the problem, we know that: x + y = 71 (because the two parts add up to 71) and x - y = 8 (because one part exceeds the other by 8) Now we have two equations with two variables. We can solve for x and y by adding the two equations: x + y = 71 x - y = 8 2x = 79 x = 39.5 Now we can substitute x back into one of the equations to solve for y: 39.5 + y = 71 y = 31.5 So the two parts are 39.5 and 31.5. None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
