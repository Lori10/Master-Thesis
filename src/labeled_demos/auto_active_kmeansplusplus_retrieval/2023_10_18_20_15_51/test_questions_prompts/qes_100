  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In the third grade of Windblown School there are 96 students, one third of them failed the math test and 1/6 failed that literature test. At least how many students failed both tests? Answer Choices: (A) 0. (B) 6. (C) 8. (D) 10. (E) 12.\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of students who failed the math test. One third of the 96 students failed the math test, so: 1/3 x 96 = 32 Therefore, 32 students failed the math test. Step 2: Find the number of students who failed the literature test. 1/6 of the 96 students failed the literature test, so: 1/6 x 96 = 16 Therefore, 16 students failed the literature test. Step 3: Find the number of students who failed both tests. We don't know the exact number of students who failed both tests, but we do know that it must be less than or equal to the smaller of the two numbers we just found (i.e. 16). Therefore, the answer is (B) 6, because that is the only option that is less than or equal to 16. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A student has to obtain 33% of the total marks to pass. He got 59 marks and failed by 40 marks. The maximum marks are? Answer Choices: (A) 450 (B) 300 (C) 500 (D) 610 (E) 175\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the maximum marks be x. The student got 59 marks and failed by 40 marks, which means he needed 33% of the total marks to pass. 33% of x can be written as 0.33x. So, we can set up the equation: 0.33x = 59 + 40 0.33x = 99 x = 99/0.33 x = 300 Therefore, the maximum marks are 300. The correct answer is (B) 300. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A pupil's marks were wrongly entered as 85 instead of 45. Due to that the average marks for the class got increased by half. The number of pupils in the class is : Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 80 (C) 20 (D) 25 (E) 26\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume there were 'n' pupils in the class before the wrong entry was made. The total marks of all the pupils before the correction = n * average marks After the correction, the total marks of all the pupils = (n-1) * average marks + 85 We know that the average marks increased by half, which means: (n-1) * average marks + 85 = (n * average marks) + (0.5 * n * average marks) Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.5 * n * average marks = 85 - average marks 0.5 * n * average marks = 40 n * average marks = 80 We know that the average marks of the class is (85 + 45)/2 = 65 So, n * 65 = 80 n = 80/65 = 1.23 Since the number of pupils cannot be a decimal, we can round it up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the number of pupils in the class is 25. Hence, the answer is (D) 25. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Which of the following values is the greatest Answer Choices: (A) a)  30% of 89 (B) b)  22% of 78 (C) c)  33% of 67 (D) d)  44% of 56 (E) e)  55% of 45\nA: Let's think step by step. A) 30% of 89 = 0.3 x 89 = 26.7 B) 22% of 78 = 0.22 x 78 = 17.16 C) 33% of 67 = 0.33 x 67 = 22.11 D) 44% of 56 = 0.44 x 56 = 24.64 E) 55% of 45 = 0.55 x 45 = 24.75 Therefore, the greatest value is option (E) 55% of 45. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
