  "test_question": "Q: Machine A puts out a yo-yo every 6 minutes. Machine B puts out a yo-yo every 9 minutes. After how many minutes will they have produced 10 yo-yos? Answer Choices: (A) 24 minutes (B) 32 minutes (C) 36 minutes (D) 64 minutes (E) 72 minutes",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 25 copies per minute. A second copy machine, working at a constant rate, makes 55 copies per minute. Working together at their respective rates, how many copies do the two machines make in half an hour ? Answer Choices: (A) 90 (B) 2,400 (C) 4,500 (D) 5,400 (E) 324,000\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the combined rate of the two machines. To do this, we add their individual rates: 25 copies/minute + 55 copies/minute = 80 copies/minute Next, we need to convert half an hour to minutes: 30 minutes Now we can use the formula: rate x time = amount Plugging in the values we have: 80 copies/minute x 30 minutes = 2400 copies Therefore, the answer is (B) 2,400. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Machine E can produce x units in 3/4 of the time it takes machine N to produce x units. Machine N can produce x units in 2/3 the time it takes machine O to produce x units. If all three machines are working simultaneously, what fraction of the total output is produced by machine N? Answer Choices: (A)  1/2 (B)  1/3 (C)  4/13 (D)  8/29 (E)  6/33\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that machine O takes t time to produce x units. Then, machine N will take 2t/3 time to produce x units and machine E will take 3t/4 time to produce x units. Now, let's find the rate of production of each machine. Machine O produces x/t units per unit time. Machine N produces x/(2t/3) = 3x/(2t) units per unit time. Machine E produces x/(3t/4) = 4x/(3t) units per unit time. If all three machines are working simultaneously, then the total rate of production is the sum of the individual rates of production. So, the total rate of production is: x/t + 3x/(2t) + 4x/(3t) = (13x/6t) Therefore, machine N's contribution to the total output is: (3x/(2t)) / (13x/6t) = 9/26 So, the answer is (D) 8/29. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: It takes 40 identical printing presses 15 hours to print 500,000 papers. How many hours would it take 30 of these printing presses to print 500,000 papers? Answer Choices: (A) 16 (B) 18 (C) 20 (D) 21 (E) 24\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 40 printing presses can print 500,000 papers in 15 hours. So, we can find the rate of printing of each press by dividing the total number of papers by the total number of hours and the number of presses: Rate of each press = 500,000 / (40 x 15) = 833.33 papers per hour Now, we need to find how many hours it would take 30 printing presses to print 500,000 papers at the same rate. Total time = Total number of papers / (Rate of each press x Number of presses) Total time = 500,000 / (833.33 x 30) Total time = 20 hours Therefore, the answer is (C) 20. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A tyre has two punctures. The first puncture alone would have made the tyre flat in 9 minutes and the second alone would have done it in 4 minutes. If air leaks out at a constant rate, how long does it take both the punctures together to make it flat ? Answer Choices: (A) 3 1/5min (B) 2 10/13min (C) 3 3/5min (D) 3 4/5min (E) 3 min\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the tyre has a capacity of 36 units of air (LCM of 4 and 9). The first puncture can make the tyre flat in 9 minutes, which means it can make the tyre lose 4 units of air per minute (36/9). Similarly, the second puncture can make the tyre flat in 4 minutes, which means it can make the tyre lose 9 units of air per minute (36/4). Now, let's assume that both punctures are working together. Let's say the time taken for both punctures to make the tyre flat is 't' minutes. So, in 't' minutes, the first puncture would have made the tyre lose 4t units of air and the second puncture would have made the tyre lose 9t units of air. Since both punctures are working together, the total air lost in 't' minutes would be 4t + 9t = 13t. We know that the tyre has a capacity of 36 units of air. So, 13t = 36 t = 36/13 t = 2 10/13 minutes Therefore, the answer is option (B) 2 10/13 minutes. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
