We can see that the sequence is decreasing by 3, then by 2, then by 3, then by 2, and so on. So, the next number in the sequence should decrease by 3 again. Starting from 32, if we subtract 3, we get 29. Therefore, the answer is (C) 29. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The sum of the first 50 positive even integers is 2550. What is the sum of the even integers from 302 to 400 inclusive? Answer Choices: (A) 11,550 (B) 14,550 (C) 17,550 (D) 20,550 (E) 23,550\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the sum of the first 50 positive even integers. We know that the first even integer is 2, the second is 4, the third is 6, and so on. So, we can write the sum as: 2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 98 + 100 = 2550 Next, we need to find the sum of the even integers from 302 to 400 inclusive. We can start by finding the sum of all even integers from 2 to 400, and then subtracting the sum of all even integers from 2 to 300. This will give us the sum of even integers from 302 to 400. The sum of all even integers from 2 to 400 can be found using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = (n/2)(a + l) where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term. In this case, a = 2, l = 400, and n = (400 - 2)/2 + 1 = 200. So, we have: S1 = (200/2)(2 + 400) = 40200 Next, we need to find the sum of all even integers from 2 to 300. Using the same formula, we have: S2 = (150/2)(2 + 300) = 22650 Finally, we can find the sum of even integers from 302 to 400 by subtracting S2 from S1: S3 = S1 - S2 = 40200 - 22650 = 17550 Therefore, the answer is (C) 17,550. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: What Should come in place of the question mark in the following number series ?\nQ. 5 8 10 12 16 (?) Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 18 (C) 17 (D) 21 (E) 23\nA: Let's think step by step. The difference between 5 and 8 is 3, between 8 and 10 is 2, between 10 and 12 is 2, and between 12 and 16 is 4. So, it seems like the differences are not following a specific pattern. To find the missing number, we can try to look for other patterns. One possible pattern is that the numbers are increasing by 1, then 2, then 2, then 4, and so on. Following this pattern, the next number should increase by 4, making it 16 + 4 = 20. However, this number is not among the answer choices. The closest answer choice is (D) 21, which is an increase of 5 from the previous number. This pattern is also possible, as it would be an increase of 1, then 2, then 2, then 5. Therefore, the answer is (D) 21. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: The average of 20 numbers is zero. Of them, at the most, how many may be greater than zero? Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 10 (D) 19 (E) None of the above\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. Let's assume that there are 'n' numbers greater than zero. If the average of 20 numbers is zero, then the sum of all 20 numbers must be zero. Let's say the sum of the 'n' positive numbers is 'x' and the sum of the remaining (20-n) negative numbers is '-x'. So, we can write an equation as: x - (20-n)x/n = 0 Simplifying this equation, we get: n >= 10 Therefore, the maximum number of positive numbers can be 10. Hence, the answer is (C) 10. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
