  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Mohit sold an article for Rs. 18000. Had he offered a discount of 10% on the selling price, he would have earned a profit of 8%. What is the cost price of the article? Answer Choices: (A) 15000 (B) 15002 (C) 26879 (D) 26992 (E) 12681\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the cost price of the article be x. If Mohit had offered a discount of 10%, the selling price would have been 90% of the original selling price, which is 0.9 * 18000 = 16200. If he had earned a profit of 8%, the cost price would have been (16200/1.08) = 15000. Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 15000. The correct answer is (A) 15000.

If the tax rate was 5%. then what was the cost of the tax free items? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 99.50 (B) Rs. 70.50 (C) Rs. 89.50 (D) Rs. 69.50 (E) Rs. 80.50\nA: Let's think step by step. The total cost of the items including tax is Rs. 100. Out of this, 50 paise (or Rs. 0.50) went on sales tax. We know that the tax rate is 5%. So, we can set up an equation: 5% of the taxable purchases = Rs. 0.50 To find the cost of tax-free items, we need to subtract the tax amount from the total cost: Cost of tax-free items = Total cost - Tax amount Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 100 - Rs. 0.50 Cost of tax-free items = Rs. 99.50 Therefore, the answer is (A) Rs. 99.50. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The price of an item is discounted 10 percent on day 1 of a sale. On day 2, the item is discounted another 10 percent, and on day 3, it is discounted an additional 20 percent. The price of the item on day 3 is what percentage of the sale price on day 1? Answer Choices: (A) 28% (B) 40% (C) 64.8% (D) 70% (E) 72%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the original price of the item is $100. On day 1, the item is discounted by 10%, so the sale price on day 1 is: $100 - (10% of $100) = $90 On day 2, the item is discounted by another 10%, so the sale price on day 2 is: $90 - (10% of $90) = $81 On day 3, the item is discounted by 20%, so the sale price on day 3 is: $81 - (20% of $81) = $64.8 Therefore, the price of the item on day 3 is $64.8, which is 64.8% of the sale price on day 1 ($90). So, the answer is (C) 64.8%. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A shopkeeper sells 20% of his stock at 10% profit ans sells the remaining at a loss of 5%. He incurred an overall loss of Rs. 450. Find the total worth of the stock? Answer Choices: (A) 20029 (B) 22500 (C) 20289 (D) 20027 (E) 20026\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the total worth of the stock be x. He sells 20% of his stock at a 10% profit, which means he sells the remaining 80% at a loss of 5%. Profit earned on 20% of the stock = 20/100 * x * 10/100 = 0.02x Loss incurred on 80% of the stock = 80/100 * x * 5/100 = 0.04x Overall loss = 0.04x - 0.02x = 0.02x = Rs. 450 Therefore, x = Rs. 22,500 Hence, the correct answer is option (B) 22500. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
