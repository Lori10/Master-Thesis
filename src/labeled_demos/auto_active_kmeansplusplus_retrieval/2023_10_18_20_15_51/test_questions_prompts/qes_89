  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A certain manufacturer increased its gross profit on a product from 10 percent of the cost of the product to 15 percent of the cost by changing the selling price. If the new selling price was $92.00 and the cost of the product remained the same, what was the old selling price? Answer Choices: (A) $77.40 (B) $80.00 (C) $83.64 (D) $87.40 (E) $88.00\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the cost of the product. Let's assume the cost is x. The manufacturer increased its gross profit from 10% to 15%, which means the profit increased by 5% of the cost. So, the new profit is 0.15x and the old profit is 0.10x. We know that the new selling price is $92.00, so we can set up an equation: x + 0.15x = cost + new profit = $92.00 Simplifying the equation: 1.15x = $92.00 x = $80.00 Therefore, the cost of the product is $80.00. To find the old selling price, we need to use the old profit: 0.10x = 0.10($80.00) = $8.00 The old selling price is the cost plus the old profit: $80.00 + $8.00 = $88.00 So, the answer is (E) $88.00. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: By selling 300 apples a seller gains the selling price of 60 apples. The gain percent of the seller is Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 88 (C) 25 (D) 27 (E) 19\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the selling price of one apple is $1. Therefore, the selling price of 300 apples is $300 and the selling price of 60 apples is $60. The seller gains the selling price of 60 apples, which is $60. Profit percent = (Profit/Cost Price) x 100 Here, the profit is $60 and the cost price is the selling price of 240 apples (300-60), which is $240. Profit percent = (60/240) x 100 = 25% Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 25. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The value of a machine depreciates at 23% per annum. If its present value is $1,50,000, at what price should it be sold after two years such that a profit of $24,000 is made? Answer Choices: (A) $252935 (B) $432935 (C) $122935 (D) $112935 (E) $152935\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the depreciated value of the machine after two years. The value of the machine depreciates at 23% per annum, which means that after one year, its value will be 77% of its original value (100% - 23% = 77%). So, after two years, its value will be 77% of 77% of its original value: = 0.77 x 0.77 x $1,50,000 = $84,297.50 Now, we need to add the profit of $24,000 to this value to get the selling price: = $84,297.50 + $24,000 = $1,08,297.50 Therefore, the correct answer is (D) $112935. None of the given options match the calculated value exactly, but option (D) is the closest. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Mohit sold an article for Rs. 18000. Had he offered a discount of 10% on the selling price, he would have earned a profit of 8%. What is the cost price of the article? Answer Choices: (A) 15000 (B) 15002 (C) 26879 (D) 26992 (E) 12681\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the cost price of the article be x. If Mohit had offered a discount of 10%, the selling price would have been 90% of the original selling price, which is 0.9 * 18000 = 16200. If he had earned a profit of 8%, the cost price would have been (16200/1.08) = 15000. Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 15000. The correct answer is (A) 15000. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
