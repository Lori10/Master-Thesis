  "test_question": "Q: A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Two trains of equal lengths take 10 sec and 15 sec respectively to cross a telegraph post. If the length of each train be 120 m, in what time will they cross other travelling in opposite direction? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 12 (C) 13 (D) 14 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. The total distance covered by both trains when they cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is 240 meters. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds, since they are travelling in opposite directions. Let's call this speed \"v\". We know that the first train takes 10 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/10 = 12 m/s. Similarly, the second train takes 15 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/15 = 8 m/s. Therefore, the relative speed of the two trains is v = 12 + 8 = 20 m/s. To find the time it takes for the two trains to cross each other, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed Plugging in the values we know, we get: time = 240 / 20 = 12 seconds Therefore, the answer is (B) 12. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: What would happen in the previous question if both A and B had started at point P. Answer Choices: (A) 800 Km (B) 600 Km (C) 1000 Km (D) 350 Km (E) 250 Km\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that A travels at a speed of 50 km/h and B travels at a speed of 40 km/h. If they both started at point P, they would be moving in opposite directions. Let's say they meet after x hours. In that time, A would have traveled 50x km and B would have traveled 40x km. We also know that the distance between A and B is 600 km. So, we can set up the equation: 50x + 40x = 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 90x = 600 x = 6.67 hours Now that we know they meet after 6.67 hours, we can find out how far each of them has traveled: A: 50 km/h x 6.67 h = 333.33 km B: 40 km/h x 6.67 h = 266.67 km The total distance they have traveled is: 333.33 km + 266.67 km = 600 km Therefore, the answer is (B) 600 km. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: James took a 3-hour bike ride. In the second hour he travlled 18 miles, which was 20 percent farther than he traveled the first hour. If he traveled 25 percent farther in the third hour than he did in the second hour, how many miles did jose travel during the entire ride? Answer Choices: (A) 54.0 (B) 54.9 (C) 55.5 (D) 57.0 (E) 63.0\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how far James traveled in the first hour. We know that in the second hour he traveled 20% farther than in the first hour, so we can set up the equation: 18 = 1.2x where x is the distance James traveled in the first hour. Solving for x, we get: x = 15 Next, we need to find out how far James traveled in the third hour. We know that in the third hour he traveled 25% farther than in the second hour, so we can set up the equation: d = 1.25(18) where d is the distance James traveled in the third hour. Solving for d, we get: d = 22.5 Finally, we can add up the distances traveled in each hour to find the total distance traveled: total distance = 15 + 18 + 22.5 = 55.5 Therefore, the answer is (C) 55.5. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A passenger sitting near the window in a train moving at 40 km/h, noticed that it took 3 sec. for the oncoming train to pass by. What was the speed of the oncoming train if the length of the oncoming train was 69 metres? Answer Choices: (A) a) 50km/h (B) b) 42.8km/h (C) c) 56km/h (D) d) 60km/h (E) e) 70km/h\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/h to m/s, since the length of the oncoming train is given in meters and the time taken to pass by is given in seconds. 40 km/h = (40 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 11.11 m/s Next, we can use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time to find the speed of the oncoming train. Distance = length of oncoming train = 69 m Time = 3 sec Speed = 69 / 3 = 23 m/s Finally, we need to convert the speed of the oncoming train from m/s to km/h. 23 m/s = (23 x 60 x 60) / 1000 km/h = 82.8 km/h Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
