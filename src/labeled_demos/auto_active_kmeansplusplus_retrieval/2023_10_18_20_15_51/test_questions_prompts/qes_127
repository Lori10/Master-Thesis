  "test_question": "Q: In how many ways can the letters of the word \"PROBLEC\" be rearranged to make 7 letter words such that none of the letters repeat? Answer Choices: (A) 2! (B) 3! (C) 7! (D) 8! (E) 9!",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Using all the letters of the word \"NOKIA\", how many words can be formed, which begin with N and end with A? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 24 (C) 62 (D) 78 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to choose the first letter as N, which leaves us with four letters: O, K, I, and A. Next, we need to arrange these four letters in different ways to form words. This can be done in 4! = 24 ways. Finally, we need to ensure that each word ends with A. Out of the four remaining letters, only one is A. Therefore, there is only one way to choose the last letter. So, the total number of words that can be formed is 24 x 1 = 24. Therefore, the answer is (B) 24. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In how many ways can the letters of word CAREER be arranged such that all the vowels as well as all the Consonants always appear together? Answer Choices: (A) 3!*3!*2! (B) 5!*4! (C) 5!*5! (D) 5!*4!*2! (E) 6!*4!\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we have to arrange the vowels AEE in 3! ways. Then, we have to arrange the consonants CRRR in 4! ways. Finally, we have to arrange the group of vowels and the group of consonants in 2! ways. Therefore, the total number of ways is 3! * 4! * 2! = 6 * 24 * 2 = 288. So, the correct answer is (A) 3!*3!*2!. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Using all the letters of the word \"THURSDAY\", how many different words can be formed? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 8! (C) 5 (D) 7 (E) 3\nA: Let's think step by step. We have 7 letters in the word \"THURSDAY\". To find the number of different words that can be formed using all the letters, we need to find the number of permutations of these 7 letters. The formula for finding the number of permutations of n objects taken r at a time is nPr = n!/(n-r)!. In this case, we want to find the number of permutations of all 7 letters, so we have n=7 and r=7. Therefore, the number of different words that can be formed using all the letters of \"THURSDAY\" is 7!/(7-7)! = 7!/0! = 7! = 5040. The correct answer is (B) 8!. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Number of ways in which the letters of word PARDENS can be arranged with vowels in alphabetical order, is Answer Choices: (A) 360 (B) 240 (C) 2520 (D) 480 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to identify the vowels in the word PARDENS, which are A and E. Next, we need to arrange these vowels in alphabetical order, which can be done in only one way, i.e., AE. Now, we need to arrange the remaining consonants, i.e., P, R, D, N, and S. There are 5 consonants, so they can be arranged in 5! ways. Therefore, the total number of ways in which the letters of the word PARDENS can be arranged with vowels in alphabetical order is 1 x 5! = 120. None of the answer choices match this answer, so the correct answer is None of these. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
