  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 99 (C) 88 (D) 77 (E) 23\nA: Let's think step by step. Let Q's age be x. Then, R's age will be (x + y) and T's age will be (x - y), where y is the age difference between Q and T. Given, (x + y) + (x - y) = 50 2x = 50 x = 25 Therefore, Q's age is 25. Also, R's age is (25 + y). Given, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, (25 + y) - 25 = 25 - (25 - y) y = 12.5 Therefore, R's age is (25 + 12.5) = 37.5 The difference between R and Q's age is (37.5 - 25) = 12.5 Hence, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Rose is two years older than Bruce who is twice as old as Chris. If the total of the age of Rose, B and Chris be 47 years, then how old is Bruce ? Answer Choices: (A) 18 years (B) 10 years (C) 12 years (D) 13 years (E) 14 years\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's start by assigning variables to the ages of Bruce and Chris. Let's say Bruce's age is B and Chris's age is C. According to the problem, Rose is two years older than Bruce, so her age can be represented as B + 2. We also know that Bruce is twice as old as Chris, so we can write: B = 2C Now we can substitute B = 2C into the equation for the total of their ages: (B + 2) + B + C = 47 Simplifying this equation: 2B + C = 45 Substituting B = 2C: 4C + C = 45 5C = 45 C = 9 Now we can find Bruce's age: B = 2C = 2(9) = 18 So the answer is (A) 18 years. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Current ages of Rahim and Thomas are in the ratio of 5 : 4 correspondingly. 0.7 decades hence, the ratio of their ages will become 11 : 9 correspondingly, What is Thomas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current age in years? Answer Choices: (A) 24 years (B) 44 years (C) 34 years (D) 64 years (E) 84 years\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that Rahim's current age is 5x and Thomas's current age is 4x. 0.7 decades hence means 7 years. So, after 7 years, Rahim's age will be 5x + 7 and Thomas's age will be 4x + 7. According to the problem, the ratio of their ages after 7 years will be 11:9. Therefore, we can write the equation: (5x + 7)/(4x + 7) = 11/9 Cross-multiplying, we get: 99x + 77 = 44x + 77 55x = 0 x = 0 This is not possible, so there must be an error in the problem. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: At the time of marriage, a man was 8 years elder to his wife. 15 years after their marriage, his age is 5/4 times the age of his wife. What was wife's age at the time of marriage ? Choose one answer. Answer Choices: (A) 15 years (B) 30 years (C) 18 years (D) 17 years (E) 26 years\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the man's age at the time of marriage to be M and his wife's age to be W. According to the problem, we know that: M = W + 8 (as the man was 8 years elder to his wife at the time of marriage) 15 years after their marriage, the man's age is 5/4 times the age of his wife. So, we can write: M + 15 = (5/4)(W + 15) Now, we can substitute the value of M from the first equation: W + 8 + 15 = (5/4)(W + 15) Simplifying this equation: W + 23 = (5/4)W + (75/4) Multiplying both sides by 4: 4W + 92 = 5W + 75 Subtracting 4W from both sides: W = 17 Therefore, the wife's age at the time of marriage was 17 years. Hence, the correct answer is option (D) 17 years. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
