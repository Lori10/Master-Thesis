  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A work which could be finished in 10 days was finished 3 days earlier after 10 more men joined. The number of men employed was? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 20 (C) 88 (D) 71 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the number of men initially employed be x. Then, the work done in 1 day by x men is 1/10 and the work done in 1 day by (x+10) men is 1/(10-3) = 1/7 (since the work was finished 3 days earlier). Now, we can set up an equation based on the work done by x men and (x+10) men: x/10 + (x+10)/7 = 1 Multiplying both sides by 70 (the least common multiple of 10 and 7) gives: 7x + 10(x+10) = 70 Simplifying and solving for x gives: 17x = 60 x = 60/17 Since x is not a whole number, none of the answer choices are correct. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: A can do a work in 7 days B in 12 days and C in 5 days. If they work on it together then in how many days required to complete the work? Answer Choices: (A) 420/177 (B) 420/179 (C) 410/87 (D) 90/14 (E) 77/56\nA: Let's think step by step. We can start by finding the individual rates of work for each person. A can do the work in 7 days, so their rate of work is 1/7. B can do the work in 12 days, so their rate of work is 1/12. C can do the work in 5 days, so their rate of work is 1/5. To find the combined rate of work when they work together, we add up their individual rates of work: 1/7 + 1/12 + 1/5 = 60/420 + 35/420 + 84/420 = 179/420 So when they work together, their combined rate of work is 179/420. To find how long it will take them to complete the work, we can use the formula: time = work / rate The work they need to do is 1 (the whole job), and their combined rate of work is 179/420. time = 1 / (179/420) = 420/179 Therefore, the answer is (B) 420/179. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Machine E can produce x units in 3/4 of the time it takes machine N to produce x units. Machine N can produce x units in 2/3 the time it takes machine O to produce x units. If all three machines are working simultaneously, what fraction of the total output is produced by machine N? Answer Choices: (A)  1/2 (B)  1/3 (C)  4/13 (D)  8/29 (E)  6/33\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that machine O takes t time to produce x units. Then, machine N will take 2t/3 time to produce x units and machine E will take 3t/4 time to produce x units. Now, let's find the rate of production of each machine. Machine O produces x/t units per unit time. Machine N produces x/(2t/3) = 3x/(2t) units per unit time. Machine E produces x/(3t/4) = 4x/(3t) units per unit time. If all three machines are working simultaneously, then the total rate of production is the sum of the individual rates of production. So, the total rate of production is: x/t + 3x/(2t) + 4x/(3t) = (13x/6t) Therefore, machine N's contribution to the total output is: (3x/(2t)) / (13x/6t) = 9/26 So, the answer is (D) 8/29. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If Jane takes 12 seconds to run y yards, how many minutes will it take her to run x yards at the same rate? Answer Choices: (A) xy/12 (B) 12x/(60y)  (C) 60xy/12 (D) xy/720 (E) 720x/y\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find Jane's speed in yards per second. We can do this by dividing the distance she runs by the time it takes her to run it: Speed = y/12 yards per second Next, we need to find how long it will take her to run x yards at this speed. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Plugging in the values we know: Time = x / (y/12) seconds To convert this to minutes, we need to divide by 60: Time = (x / (y/12)) / 60 minutes Simplifying: Time = (x * 12) / (y * 60) minutes Therefore, the answer is (B) 12x/(60y). The answer is B.\n\n\n"
