  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Rahim bought 65 books for Rs.1150 from one shop and 50 books for Rs.920 from another. What is the average price he paid per book ? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 18 (C) 99 (D) 787 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total cost of all the books Rahim bought. Total cost = Rs.1150 + Rs.920 = Rs.2070 Next, we need to find the total number of books Rahim bought. Total number of books = 65 + 50 = 115 Finally, we can find the average price per book by dividing the total cost by the total number of books. Average price per book = Total cost / Total number of books Average price per book = Rs.2070 / 115 Average price per book = Rs.18 Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 18. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Mohit sold an article for Rs. 18000. Had he offered a discount of 10% on the selling price, he would have earned a profit of 8%. What is the cost price of the article? Answer Choices: (A) 15000 (B) 15002 (C) 26879 (D) 26992 (E) 12681\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the cost price of the article be x. If Mohit had offered a discount of 10%, the selling price would have been 90% of the original selling price, which is 0.9 * 18000 = 16200. If he had earned a profit of 8%, the cost price would have been (16200/1.08) = 15000. Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 15000. The correct answer is (A) 15000. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A camera lens filter kit containing 5 filters sells for $52.50. If the filters are purchased individually, 2 of them are priced at $6.45 each, 2 at $11.05 each, 1 at $15.50. The amount saved by purchasing the kit is what percent of the total price of the 5 filters purchased individually? Answer Choices: (A) 3.76% (B) 4.76% (C) 5.76% (D) 6.76% (E) 7.76%\nA: Let's think step by step. The total cost of purchasing the filters individually is: 2 x $6.45 + 2 x $11.05 + $15.50 = $31.50 The cost of purchasing the kit is $52.50. The amount saved by purchasing the kit is: $31.50 - $52.50 = -$21.00 This means that purchasing the kit costs $21.00 more than purchasing the filters individually. To find the percentage of the total price saved by purchasing the kit, we need to divide the amount saved by the total cost of purchasing the filters individually and then multiply by 100: (-$21.00 / $31.50) x 100 = -66.67% This means that purchasing the kit costs 66.67% more than purchasing the filters individually. However, the question asks for the percentage of the total price saved, not the percentage of the total price increased. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: 8 people decided to split the restaurant bill evenly. If the bill was $214.18 dollars, how much money did they 1 cent is the smallest unit?

First, we need to divide the total bill by the number of people to find out how much each person should pay. $214.18 \u00f7 8 = $26.7725 Since we cannot have a fraction of a cent, we need to round up to the nearest cent. $26.77 rounds up to $26.78 Therefore, each person should pay $26.78. The closest answer choice is (B) $214.17, but that is not the correct answer. The correct answer is None of the above. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
