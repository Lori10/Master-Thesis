  "test_question": "Q: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are : Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 25 (D) 26 (E) 27",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A club with a total membership of 25 has formed 3 committees, M, S and R, which have 8, 12 and 5 members respectively. If no members of committee M is on either of the other 2 committees, what is the greatest possible number of members in the club who are on none of the committees? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 7 (C) 8 (D) 10 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of members who are on the committees. M has 8 members, S has 12 members, and R has 5 members. Since no members of M are on either of the other 2 committees, we can subtract the 8 members of M from the total number of committee members: Total committee members = 8 + 12 + 5 - 8 = 17 So, there are 17 members on the committees. To find the greatest possible number of members who are on none of the committees, we need to subtract this number from the total membership of the club: Greatest possible number of members not on committees = 25 - 17 = 8 Therefore, the answer is (C) 8. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 99 (C) 88 (D) 77 (E) 23\nA: Let's think step by step. Let Q's age be x. Then, R's age will be (x + y) and T's age will be (x - y), where y is the age difference between Q and T. Given, (x + y) + (x - y) = 50 2x = 50 x = 25 Therefore, Q's age is 25. Also, R's age is (25 + y). Given, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, (25 + y) - 25 = 25 - (25 - y) y = 12.5 Therefore, R's age is (25 + 12.5) = 37.5 The difference between R and Q's age is (37.5 - 25) = 12.5 Hence, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The 30 members of a club decided to play a badminton singles tournament. Every time a member loses a game he is out of the tournament. There are no ties. What is the minimum number of matches that must be played to determine the winner ? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 29 (C) 64 (D) 39 (E) 35\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine how many rounds of matches will be played. Since each match eliminates one player, there will be 29 matches in the first round (30 players divided into 15 matches). After the first round, there will be 15 players left, so there will be 7 matches in the second round (8 players divided into 4 matches) and 4 matches in the third round (4 players divided into 2 matches). Finally, there will be one match in the fourth round to determine the winner. Therefore, the total number of matches played will be 29 + 7 + 4 + 1 = 41. None of the answer choices match our calculation, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: In a club with 310 peopl, 138 play tennis, 255 play baseball, and 94 people play both sports. How many people do not pla a sport? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 8 (C) 4 (D) 10 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 138 people play tennis, 255 people play baseball, and 94 people play both sports. To find the number of people who play only tennis, we can subtract the number of people who play both sports from the number of people who play tennis: 138 - 94 = 44 Similarly, to find the number of people who play only baseball, we can subtract the number of people who play both sports from the number of people who play baseball: 255 - 94 = 161 Now, to find the number of people who do not play a sport, we need to subtract the total number of people who play a sport from the total number of people in the club: 310 - (44 + 161 + 94) = 11 Therefore, the answer is (E) 11. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
