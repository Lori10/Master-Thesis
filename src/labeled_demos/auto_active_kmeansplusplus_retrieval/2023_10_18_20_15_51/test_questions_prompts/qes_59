  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Kiran has 85 currency notes in all, some of which were of Rs. 100 denomination and the\nremaining of Rs. 50 denomination. The total amount of all these currency notes was Rs.\n5000. How much amount did she have in the denomination of Rs. 50?\nA. B. C. None of these D.\nAnswer: Option B\nExplanation: Answer Choices: (A) 1900 (B) 3500 (C) 4000 (D) 2000 (E) 2500\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the number of Rs. 100 notes be x and the number of Rs. 50 notes be y. We know that x + y = 85 (total number of notes) and 100x + 50y = 5000 (total amount). Simplifying the second equation, we get 2x + y = 100. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get x = 25 and y = 60. Therefore, the amount in the denomination of Rs. 50 is 50 * 60 = 3000. So, the correct answer is option B. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If a quarter kg of potato costs 60 paise, how many paise does 200 gm cost? Answer Choices: (A) 65 paise (B) 70 paise (C) 52 paise (D) 48 paise (E) 75 paise\nA: Let's think step by step. Given, 1/4 kg of potato costs 60 paise. We need to find the cost of 200 gm of potato. 1/4 kg = 250 gm So, 250 gm of potato costs 60 paise. Now, we need to find the cost of 200 gm of potato. We can use the unitary method to solve this problem. 250 gm costs 60 paise 1 gm costs (60/250) paise 200 gm costs (60/250) x 200 = 48 paise Therefore, the answer is (D) 48 paise. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A girl has exactly 6 quarters, 6 dimes, and 10 nickels in her pocket. If she withdraws a number of these coins at random, how many coins would she have to withdraw to ensure that she has at least a 50 percent chance of withdrawing at least one quarter? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) 5\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We know that the girl has 6 quarters, 6 dimes, and 10 nickels in her pocket. To find the probability of withdrawing at least one quarter, we need to find the total number of possible outcomes and the number of outcomes that include at least one quarter. The total number of possible outcomes is the sum of the number of ways she can withdraw 1 coin, 2 coins, 3 coins, and so on, up to 22 coins (the total number of coins she has). The number of outcomes that include at least one quarter is the sum of the number of ways she can withdraw 1 quarter and any combination of the remaining coins, 2 quarters and any combination of the remaining coins, and so on, up to all 6 quarters. We want to find the minimum number of coins she needs to withdraw to have at least a 50% chance of getting at least one quarter. Let's look at the answer choices: (A) 1 - If she withdraws only one coin, there is no guarantee that it will be a quarter. (B) 2 - If she withdraws two coins, there are three possible outcomes: quarter-dime, quarter-nickel, and dime-nickel. Only one of these outcomes includes a quarter, so the probability of getting at least one quarter is less than 50%. (C) 3 - If she withdraws three coins, there are ten possible outcomes: quarter-dime-nickel, quarter-nickel-nickel, dime-quarter-nickel, dime-dime-nickel, dime-nickel-nickel, quarter-quarter-dime, quarter-quarter-nickel, quarter-dime-dime, quarter-nickel-dime, and quarter-nickel-nickel. Six of these outcomes include at least one quarter, so the probability of getting at least one quarter is greater than 50%. (D) 4 - If she withdraws four coins, there are 35 possible outcomes. We can calculate the number of outcomes that include at least one quarter by subtracting the number of outcomes that include no quarters from the total number of outcomes. The number of outcomes that include no quarters is the number of ways she can withdraw 4 dimes and 1 nickel, 3 dimes and 2 nickels, 2 dimes and 3 nickels, or 1 dime and 4 nickels, which is 4+10+10+4=28. Therefore, the number of outcomes that include at least one quarter is 35-28=7. The probability of getting at least one quarter is 7/35, which is less than 50%. (E) 5 - If she withdraws five coins, there are 56 possible outcomes. We can calculate the number of outcomes that include at least one quarter by subtracting the number of outcomes that include no quarters or only one quarter from the total number of outcomes. The number of outcomes that include no quarters is the number of ways she can withdraw 5 dimes and no nickels, which is 1. The number of outcomes that include only one quarter is the number of ways she can withdraw 1 quarter and any combination of the remaining coins, which is 5+10+10=25. Therefore, the number of outcomes that include at least two quarters is 56-1-25=30. The probability of getting at least one quarter is 30/56, which is greater than 50%. Therefore, the answer is (C) 3. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Rahim bought 65 books for Rs.1150 from one shop and 50 books for Rs.920 from another. What is the average price he paid per book ? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 18 (C) 99 (D) 787 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total cost of all the books Rahim bought. Total cost = Rs.1150 + Rs.920 = Rs.2070 Next, we need to find the total number of books Rahim bought. Total number of books = 65 + 50 = 115 Finally, we can find the average price per book by dividing the total cost by the total number of books. Average price per book = Total cost / Total number of books Average price per book = Rs.2070 / 115 Average price per book = Rs.18 Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 18. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
