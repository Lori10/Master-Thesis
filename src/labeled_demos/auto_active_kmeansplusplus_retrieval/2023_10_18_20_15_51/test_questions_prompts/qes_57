  "test_question": "Q: What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729. Answer Choices: (A) 37 (B) 38 (C) 36 (D) 30 (E) 39",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: what is the smallest number should be added to 5377 so that the sum is completely divisible by 7? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 4 (C) 6 (D) 2 (E) 1\nA: Let's think step by step. To make a number completely divisible by 7, we need to add the smallest number that will make the sum a multiple of 7. We can find this number by taking the remainder of the original number when divided by 7 and subtracting it from 7. So, let's find the remainder of 5377 when divided by 7: 5377 \u00f7 7 = 768 R 1 So, the remainder is 1. To make the sum completely divisible by 7, we need to add: 7 - 1 = 6 Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 6. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Find a 8 digit number that if multiplied by the number 9 or any of its multiplications products (18, 27, 36, 45,..) will result in the multiplication factor repeated (n) number of times. Answer Choices: (A) 12435687 (B) 12345679 (C) 10000000 (D) 99999999 (E) 11111111\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find a number that has 8 digits. Let's start with the number 12345678. Next, we need to check if this number satisfies the given condition. If we multiply it by 9, we get 111111102. This doesn't satisfy the condition because the multiplication factor (1) is not repeated any number of times. Let's try the next number, 12345679. If we multiply it by 9, we get 111111111. This satisfies the condition because the multiplication factor (1) is repeated 8 times. Therefore, the answer is (B) 12345679. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If the number 52,1n9, where n represents the tens digit, is a multiple of 3, then the value of n could be which of the following? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 5 (C) 3 (D) 1 (E) 0\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine if a number is a multiple of 3, we need to add up its digits and see if the sum is a multiple of 3. So, 52,1n9 = 5 + 2 + 1 + n + 9 = 17 + n. For 17 + n to be a multiple of 3, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3. The only answer choice that works is (A) 6, because 17 + 6 = 23, which is a multiple of 3 (since 2 + 3 = 5, which is not a multiple of 3). Therefore, the value of n could be 6. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: How Many 7\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are there in the following sequence which are immediately preceded by 6 but not immediately followed by 4?\n6 7 4 2 7 4 9 3 6 7 1 9 4 7 2 9 6 7 1 3 6 7 4 3 6 Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Identify all the 7's in the sequence: 6 7 4 2 7 4 9 3 6 7 1 9 4 7 2 9 6 7 1 3 6 7 4 3 6 Step 2: Check if each 7 is immediately preceded by 6 and not immediately followed by 4. Step 3: We find that there are only two 7's that meet this condition: 6 7 1 3 6 and 6 7 4 3 6. Therefore, the answer is (B) 2. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
