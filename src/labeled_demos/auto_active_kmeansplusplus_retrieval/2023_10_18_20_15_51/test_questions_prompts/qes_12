  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If P and Q are positive integers related by the equation P = 10Q - 5, what is the remainder when P is divided by 5? Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 2 (D) 3 (E) 4\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that P = 10Q - 5. To find the remainder when P is divided by 5, we can simplify the equation by taking the remainder of each term when divided by 5. 10Q has a remainder of 0 when divided by 5, since it is a multiple of 5. -5 has a remainder of 0 when divided by 5, since -5 = (-1) x 5. Therefore, P has a remainder of 0 - 0 = 0 when divided by 5. So the answer is (A) 0. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The value of (0.2\u00d70.2+0.01) (0.1\u00d70.1+0.02)-1 is equal to Answer Choices: (A) 5/3 (B) 9/5 (C) 41/4 (D) 41/12 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can simplify the expression inside the parentheses: (0.2\u00d70.2+0.01) = 0.041 (0.1\u00d70.1+0.02) = 0.012 So now we have: 0.041 \u00d7 0.012 - 1 Simplifying further: 0.000492 - 1 -0.999508 None of the answer choices match this result, so the answer is: (E) None The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: If 288 is divided into four parts proportional to 5, 7, 4, 8 then the smallest part is : Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 44 (C) 20 (D) 48 (E) 42\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total proportion: 5 + 7 + 4 + 8 = 24 Next, we need to find the proportion of each part: 5/24, 7/24, 4/24, 8/24 Simplifying these fractions, we get: 5/24, 7/24, 1/6, 1/3 Now, we can find the value of each part by multiplying its proportion by the total value: 5/24 x 288 = 60 7/24 x 288 = 84 1/6 x 288 = 48 1/3 x 288 = 96 Therefore, the smallest part is 48, which corresponds to the proportion of 1/6. The correct answer is (D) 48. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Find large number from given question. The difference of 2 numbers is 1365. On dividing the larger number by the smaller, we get 6 as quotient and the 15 as remainder Answer Choices: (A) 1345 (B) 1450 (C) 1440 (D) 1546 (E) 1635\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the smaller number to be x. According to the question, the larger number will be x + 1365. Also, we know that on dividing the larger number by the smaller, we get 6 as quotient and 15 as remainder. So, we can write the equation as: x + 1365 = 6x + 15 Simplifying this equation, we get: 5x = 1350 x = 270 Therefore, the smaller number is 270 and the larger number is 270 + 1365 = 1635. Hence, the answer is (E) 1635. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
