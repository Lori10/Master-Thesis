  "test_question": "Q: A number is as much greater than 36 as is less than 86. Find the Number. Answer Choices: (A) 60 (B) 56 (C) 51 (D) 61 (E) 41",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: 56, 63, 59, 11, 57, 6, 11\nWhich of the following numbers is lower than the median but greater than the mean of the set of the numbers in the list? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 32 (C) 49 (D) 56 (E) 58\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the median of the set of numbers. To do this, we need to arrange the numbers in order from least to greatest: 6, 11, 11, 56, 57, 59, 63 The median is the middle number, which is 56. Next, we need to find the mean of the set of numbers: (6 + 11 + 11 + 56 + 57 + 59 + 63) / 7 = 38 So, we are looking for a number that is lower than 56 but greater than 38. Option (B) 32 is lower than both the median and the mean, so it is not the answer. Option (A) 21 is lower than both the median and the mean, so it is not the answer. Option (C) 49 is greater than the mean but also greater than the median, so it is not the answer. Option (D) 56 is equal to the median, so it is not the answer. Option (E) 58 is greater than the median, so it is not the answer. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Which of the following values is the greatest Answer Choices: (A) a)  30% of 89 (B) b)  22% of 78 (C) c)  33% of 67 (D) d)  44% of 56 (E) e)  55% of 45\nA: Let's think step by step. A) 30% of 89 = 0.3 x 89 = 26.7 B) 22% of 78 = 0.22 x 78 = 17.16 C) 33% of 67 = 0.33 x 67 = 22.11 D) 44% of 56 = 0.44 x 56 = 24.64 E) 55% of 45 = 0.55 x 45 = 24.75 Therefore, the greatest value is option (E) 55% of 45. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: How many 4-digit Q numbers (ABCD) can be formed such that |A \u2013 D| = 2? Answer Choices: (A) 2,000 (B) 1,900 (C) 1,800 (D) 1,600 (E) 1,500\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that |A \u2013 D| = 2. This means that A and D are either 2 digits apart or 2 digits away from each other in the number line. Case 1: A is 2 digits greater than D. In this case, we can choose any digit from 1 to 9 for D (since it's a 4-digit number, we can't have 0 as the first digit). Then, A can be any digit that is 2 greater than D, except for 9 (since we can't have a 5th digit). So, there are 8 choices for A. Case 2: D is 2 digits greater than A. This is the same as Case 1, but with A and D switched. So, there are also 8 choices for A in this case. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit Q numbers that can be formed is 8 + 8 = 16. The answer is (D) 1,600. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: 50, 47, 45, 42, 40, 37, 35, 32, ? Answer Choices: (A) 31 (B) 30 (C) 29 (D) 28 (E) 27\nA: Let's think step by step. We can see that the sequence is decreasing by 3, then by 2, then by 3, then by 2, and so on. So, the next number in the sequence should decrease by 3 again. Starting from 32, if we subtract 3, we get 29. Therefore, the answer is (C) 29. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
