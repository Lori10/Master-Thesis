  "formatted_prompt": "Q: What is the ratio G of the surface area of a cube to the surface area of a rectangular solid identical to the cube in all ways except that its length has been doubled? Answer Choices: (A) 1/4 (B) 3/8 (C) 1/2 (D) 3/5 (E) 2\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. Let's assume that the cube has a side length of \"x\". Therefore, its surface area would be 6x^2 (since there are 6 faces, each with an area of x^2). Now, let's consider the rectangular solid that is identical to the cube in all ways except that its length has been doubled. This means that its dimensions are 2x, x, and x (since the width and height are the same as the cube). Therefore, its surface area would be: 2(2x)(x) + 2(2x)(x) + 2(x)(x) = 4x^2 + 4x^2 + 2x^2 = 10x^2 Now, we can find the ratio G of the surface area of the cube to the surface area of the rectangular solid by dividing the surface area of the cube by the surface area of the rectangular solid: G = (surface area of cube) / (surface area of rectangular solid) G = (6x^2) / (10x^2) G = 3/5 Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 3/5. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: In the formula V = 1/(2r)^2, if r is halved, then V is multiplied by Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 8 (C) 1 (D) 1/8 (E) 1/64\nA: Let's think step by step. The formula is V = 1/(2r)^2. If r is halved, then the new radius becomes r/2. Substituting this new value of r in the formula, we get: V = 1/(2(r/2))^2 V = 1/(r^2/2^2) V = 1/(r^2/4) V = 4/r^2 So, the new volume is 4/r^2 times the original volume. Therefore, if r is halved, V is multiplied by 4. The correct answer is (A) 2. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A circular mat with diameter 3.5 inches is placed on a square tabletop, each of whose sides is 6 inches long. Which of the following is closest to the fraction of the tabletop covered by the mat? Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 1 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) 5\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the area of the circular mat. The formula for the area of a circle is A = \u03c0r^2, where r is the radius. The diameter of the mat is 3.5 inches, so the radius is half of that, which is 1.75 inches. Therefore, the area of the mat is: A = \u03c0(1.75)^2 A \u2248 9.62 square inches Next, we need to find the area of the tabletop. The formula for the area of a square is A = s^2, where s is the length of a side. The sides of the tabletop are 6 inches long, so the area of the tabletop is: A = 6^2 A = 36 square inches To find the fraction of the tabletop covered by the mat, we need to divide the area of the mat by the area of the tabletop: 9.62 / 36 \u2248 0.267 This means that the mat covers approximately 26.7% of the tabletop. None of the answer choices given match this result, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: If p/7 = r/2 and r = 0.75s, what is the ratio of p to r to s? Answer Choices: (A) 2 : 3 : 4 (B) 8 : 12 : 9 (C) 21 : 6 : 8 (D) 6 : 4 : 3 (E) 12 : 8 : 3\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can simplify the given equation by cross-multiplying: 2p = 7r. Next, we can substitute the given value of r in terms of s: 2p = 7(0.75s) = 21s/4. Solving for p, we get: p = (21s/4) / 2 = 21s/8. So the ratio of p to r to s is: p : r : s = 21s/8 : 0.75s : s = 21 : 6 : 8. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 21 : 6 : 8. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
