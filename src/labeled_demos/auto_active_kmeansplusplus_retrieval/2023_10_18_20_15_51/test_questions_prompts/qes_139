  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The difference between a positive proper fraction and its reciprocal is 9/20. The fraction is? Answer Choices: (A) 4/5 (B) 4/7 (C) 5 (D) 5/7 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the fraction be x/y. According to the problem, x/y - y/x = 9/20 Multiplying both sides by xy, we get x^2 - y^2 = 9xy/20 Simplifying, 20x^2 - 20y^2 = 9xy 20x^2 - 9xy - 20y^2 = 0 We can factor this as (4x - 5y)(5x + 4y) = 0 So either 4x - 5y = 0 or 5x + 4y = 0. If 4x - 5y = 0, then x/y = 5/4. If 5x + 4y = 0, then x/y = -4/5, but this is not a positive proper fraction. Therefore, the answer is (A) 4/5. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A numberais squared and then multiplied by negative 3. The result of this operation T is equal to three times the sum of three timesaand two. What is one possible value ofa? Answer Choices: (A) -3 (B) -2 (C) 1 (D) 2 (E) 3\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's translate the given information into an equation. a^2 * (-3) = 3(3a + 2) Simplifying the right side of the equation: a^2 * (-3) = 9a + 6 Multiplying both sides by -1 to get rid of the negative coefficient: a^2 * 3 = -9a - 6 Bringing all terms to one side: a^2 * 3 + 9a + 6 = 0 Now we can solve for a using the quadratic formula: a = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a a = (-9 \u00b1 sqrt(9^2 - 4(3)(6))) / 2(3) a = (-9 \u00b1 sqrt(57)) / 6 a \u2248 -2.07 or a \u2248 -1.26 Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: If (x^2 + 1)y=8, which of the following is not a possible value for y? Answer Choices: (A) 8/2 (B) 2/5 (C) 18/3 (D) 3 (E) 17/2\nA: Let's think step by step. We are given the equation (x^2 + 1)y = 8. To find the possible values of y, we need to solve for y. Dividing both sides by (x^2 + 1), we get: y = 8/(x^2 + 1) So, any value of y that makes the denominator (x^2 + 1) equal to zero is not possible, as division by zero is undefined. The denominator (x^2 + 1) is always positive, so it can never be zero. Therefore, all the given answer choices are possible values of y. Hence, the answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A HEXAGON IS FORMED ABCDEF WHICH PERIMETER 36cm. A POLYGON IS FORMED BY JOINING THE POINTS AE &BD . FIND THE AREA OF THE POLYGON ABDE? Answer Choices: (A) 34\u221a3 cm2 (B) 35\u221a3 cm2 (C) 36\u221a3 cm2 (D) 37\u221a3 cm2 (E) 38\u221a3 cm2\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length of each side of the hexagon. Since the perimeter is 36cm and there are six sides, each side has a length of 6cm. Next, we need to find the area of triangle ABE. We can use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is 1/2 * base * height. The base is AB, which has a length of 6cm. To find the height, we need to draw a perpendicular line from E to AB. Let's call the point where the perpendicular line intersects AB point G. Triangle AEG is a 30-60-90 triangle, so the height EG is 3\u221a3 cm. Therefore, the area of triangle ABE is 1/2 * 6cm * 3\u221a3 cm = 9\u221a3 cm2. We can use the same method to find the area of triangle BDE. The base is BD, which also has a length of 6cm. To find the height, we need to draw a perpendicular line from D to BD. Let's call the point where the perpendicular line intersects BD point H. Triangle BDH is also a 30-60-90 triangle, so the height DH is 3\u221a3 cm. Therefore, the area of triangle BDE is 1/2 * 6cm * 3\u221a3 cm = 9\u221a3 cm2. Finally, we can find the area of the polygon ABDE by adding the areas of triangles ABE and BDE. 9\u221a3 cm2 + 9\u221a3 cm2 = 18\u221a3 cm2. Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) since none of the given answer choices match our calculated answer of 18\u221a3 cm2. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
