  "test_question": "Q: John would make the 3-letter codes with diffenrent 5 vowels and 20 consonants with the condition that the middle letter must be vowel and the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant. How many different codes can be made? Answer Choices: (A) 1,980 (B) 2,020 (C) 2,100 (D) 2,200 (E) 1,900",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In how many ways can the letters of word CAREER be arranged such that all the vowels as well as all the Consonants always appear together? Answer Choices: (A) 3!*3!*2! (B) 5!*4! (C) 5!*5! (D) 5!*4!*2! (E) 6!*4!\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we have to arrange the vowels AEE in 3! ways. Then, we have to arrange the consonants CRRR in 4! ways. Finally, we have to arrange the group of vowels and the group of consonants in 2! ways. Therefore, the total number of ways is 3! * 4! * 2! = 6 * 24 * 2 = 288. So, the correct answer is (A) 3!*3!*2!. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Using all the letters of the word \"NOKIA\", how many words can be formed, which begin with N and end with A? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 24 (C) 62 (D) 78 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to choose the first letter as N, which leaves us with four letters: O, K, I, and A. Next, we need to arrange these four letters in different ways to form words. This can be done in 4! = 24 ways. Finally, we need to ensure that each word ends with A. Out of the four remaining letters, only one is A. Therefore, there is only one way to choose the last letter. So, the total number of words that can be formed is 24 x 1 = 24. Therefore, the answer is (B) 24. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Number of ways in which the letters of word PARDENS can be arranged with vowels in alphabetical order, is Answer Choices: (A) 360 (B) 240 (C) 2520 (D) 480 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to identify the vowels in the word PARDENS, which are A and E. Next, we need to arrange these vowels in alphabetical order, which can be done in only one way, i.e., AE. Now, we need to arrange the remaining consonants, i.e., P, R, D, N, and S. There are 5 consonants, so they can be arranged in 5! ways. Therefore, the total number of ways in which the letters of the word PARDENS can be arranged with vowels in alphabetical order is 1 x 5! = 120. None of the answer choices match this answer, so the correct answer is None of these. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: How many words can be formed by using all the letters of the word \u201cDAUGHTER\u201d so that vowels always come together & vowels are never together? Answer Choices: (A) 5120 (B) 1240 (C) 4320 (D) 6512 (E) 1204\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of arrangements of the letters in the word \"DAUGHTER\". This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is nPr = n!/(n-r)!. Here, we have 8 letters, so n = 8. nPr = 8!/(8-8)! = 8! = 40,320 Next, we need to find the number of arrangements where the vowels always come together. We can treat the group of vowels (AUE) as a single object and find the number of arrangements of the resulting 6 objects (D, G, H, T, R, AUE). This can be done using the same formula as before. nPr = 6!/(6-6)! = 6! = 720 However, we need to multiply this by the number of ways the vowels can be arranged within the group (AUE). This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is nPr = n!/(n-r)!. Here, we have 3 vowels, so n = 3. nPr = 3!/(3-3)! = 3! = 6 So, the total number of arrangements where the vowels always come together is: 720 x 6 = 4,320 Finally, we need to subtract the number of arrangements where the vowels are together from the total number of arrangements to get the number of arrangements where the vowels are never together. 40,320 - 4,320 = 36,000 Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the correct answer of 36,000. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
