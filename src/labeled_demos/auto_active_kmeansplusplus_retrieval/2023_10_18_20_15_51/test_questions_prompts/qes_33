  "test_question": "Q: An express electric train takes exact three seconds to enter tunnel which is 1 mile long.\nIf train is traveling at 120 mile an hour, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel ? Answer Choices: (A) 43 seconds (B) 39 seconds (C) 20 seconds (D) 33 seconds (E) 55 seconds",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A train 700 m long is running at a speed of 78 km/hr. If it crosses a tunnel in 1 min, then the length of the tunnel is? Answer Choices: (A) 298 m (B) 468 m (C) 600 m (D) 667 m (E) 781 m\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s. 78 km/hr = (78 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 21.67 m/s Next, we need to find the time taken by the train to cross the tunnel. We know that the length of the train is 700 m and it crosses the tunnel in 1 min (60 seconds). Therefore, the speed of the train relative to the tunnel is: Speed = Distance / Time Speed = (700 + Length of tunnel) / 60 Speed = (700 + Length of tunnel) / 60 Multiplying both sides by 60: Speed x 60 = 700 + Length of tunnel 21.67 x 60 = 700 + Length of tunnel 1300.2 - 700 = Length of tunnel Length of tunnel = 600.2 m Therefore, the length of the tunnel is approximately 600 m. The closest answer choice is (C) 600 m. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Two trains of equal lengths take 10 sec and 15 sec respectively to cross a telegraph post. If the length of each train be 120 m, in what time will they cross other travelling in opposite direction? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 12 (C) 13 (D) 14 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. The total distance covered by both trains when they cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is 240 meters. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds, since they are travelling in opposite directions. Let's call this speed \"v\". We know that the first train takes 10 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/10 = 12 m/s. Similarly, the second train takes 15 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/15 = 8 m/s. Therefore, the relative speed of the two trains is v = 12 + 8 = 20 m/s. To find the time it takes for the two trains to cross each other, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed Plugging in the values we know, we get: time = 240 / 20 = 12 seconds Therefore, the answer is (B) 12. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A passenger sitting near the window in a train moving at 40 km/h, noticed that it took 3 sec. for the oncoming train to pass by. What was the speed of the oncoming train if the length of the oncoming train was 69 metres? Answer Choices: (A) a) 50km/h (B) b) 42.8km/h (C) c) 56km/h (D) d) 60km/h (E) e) 70km/h\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/h to m/s, since the length of the oncoming train is given in meters and the time taken to pass by is given in seconds. 40 km/h = (40 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 11.11 m/s Next, we can use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time to find the speed of the oncoming train. Distance = length of oncoming train = 69 m Time = 3 sec Speed = 69 / 3 = 23 m/s Finally, we need to convert the speed of the oncoming train from m/s to km/h. 23 m/s = (23 x 60 x 60) / 1000 km/h = 82.8 km/h Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If a truck is traveling at a constant rate of 54 kilometers per hour, how many seconds will it take the truck to travel a distance of 600 meters? (1 kilometer = 1000 meters) Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 24 (C) 30 (D) 36 (E) 40\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the truck from kilometers per hour to meters per second since the distance given is in meters. 54 kilometers per hour = 54,000 meters per hour (since 1 kilometer = 1000 meters) = 15 meters per second (since 1 hour = 3600 seconds) Now, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time Plugging in the values we have: 600 meters = 15 meters per second x time Solving for time: time = 600 meters / 15 meters per second time = 40 seconds Therefore, the answer is (E) 40. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
