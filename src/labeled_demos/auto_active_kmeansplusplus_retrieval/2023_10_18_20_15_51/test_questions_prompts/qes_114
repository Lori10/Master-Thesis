  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The average age of students of a class is 15.8 years. The average age of boys in the class is 16.4 years and that of the girls is 15.4 years. The ration of the number of boys to the number of girls in the class is: Answer Choices: (A) 2:5 (B) 2:3 (C) 2:4 (D) 2:1 (E) 2:9\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the number of boys in the class be 'b' and the number of girls be 'g'. We know that the average age of the class is 15.8 years. So, the total age of all the students in the class = 15.8 x (b+g) We also know that the average age of boys in the class is 16.4 years. So, the total age of all the boys in the class = 16.4 x b Similarly, the total age of all the girls in the class = 15.4 x g Now, we can form an equation using the above information: (16.4 x b + 15.4 x g) / (b+g) = 15.8 Simplifying this equation, we get: 16.4b + 15.4g = 15.8b + 15.8g 0.6b = 0.4g b/g = 2/3 Therefore, the ratio of the number of boys to the number of girls in the class is 2:3. Hence, the correct answer is option (B) 2:3. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: At a contest with 2,500 participants, 1/2 of the people are aged 10 to 12. Next year, the number of people aged 10 to 12 will increase by 1/5. After this change, what percentage of the total 2,500 people will the 10- to 12-year-olds represent? Answer Choices: (A) 55% (B) 60% (C) 50% (D) 45% (E) 66%\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 at the contest. 1/2 of 2,500 = 1,250 people aged 10 to 12. Step 2: Find the number of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1/5 of 1,250 = 250 people increase. 1,250 + 250 = 1,500 people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. Step 3: Find the percentage of people aged 10 to 12 after the increase. 1,500/2,500 x 100% = 60% Therefore, the answer is (B) 60%. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: From a group of boys and girls, 15 girls leave. They are then left 2 boys for each girl. After this, 54 boys leave. There are then 5 girls for each boy. Find the number of girls in the beginning Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 10 (C) 30 (D) 50 (E) 45\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Let's assume the number of girls in the beginning is 'g' and the number of boys is 'b'. Step 2: \"From a group of boys and girls, 15 girls leave.\" This means there are now 'g-15' girls and 'b' boys. Step 3: \"They are then left 2 boys for each girl.\" This means the number of boys is twice the number of girls. So, we can write an equation: b = 2(g-15). Step 4: \"After this, 54 boys leave.\" This means there are now 'g-15' girls and 'b-54' boys. Step 5: \"There are then 5 girls for each boy.\" This means the number of girls is five times the number of boys. So, we can write another equation: g-15 = 5(b-54). Step 6: Now we have two equations with two variables. We can solve for 'g'. b = 2(g-15) --> b = 2g - 30 g-15 = 5(b-54) --> g-15 = 5(2g-84) --> g-15 = 10g - 420 --> 9g = 405 --> g = 45 Step 7: The number of girls in the beginning is 45. Therefore, the answer is (E) 45. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: There are 600 boys in a hostel. Each plays either hockey or football or both. If 75% play hockey and 45% play football, how many play both? Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 150 (C) 200 (D) 180 (E) 160\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 75% of the boys play hockey, which means 0.75 x 600 = 450 boys play hockey. Similarly, 45% of the boys play football, which means 0.45 x 600 = 270 boys play football. Now, we need to find out how many boys play both hockey and football. Let's assume that x boys play both. We know that the total number of boys who play either hockey or football is 600. So, we can write an equation: Number of boys who play hockey + Number of boys who play football - Number of boys who play both = Total number of boys 450 + 270 - x = 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 720 - x = 600 x = 120 Therefore, 120 boys play both hockey and football. The correct answer is (A) 120. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
