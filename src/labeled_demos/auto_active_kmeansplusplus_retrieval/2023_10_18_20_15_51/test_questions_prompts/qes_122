  "test_question": "Q: A shopkeeper in order to promote his new shop put a discount of 20% on all the items for one day. Now he must sell the items at original price the other day. By what percentage must he increase the price to original? Answer Choices: (A) 21% (B) 20% (C) 25% (D) 33% (E) 18%",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The price of an item is discounted 10 percent on day 1 of a sale. On day 2, the item is discounted another 10 percent, and on day 3, it is discounted an additional 20 percent. The price of the item on day 3 is what percentage of the sale price on day 1? Answer Choices: (A) 28% (B) 40% (C) 64.8% (D) 70% (E) 72%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the original price of the item is $100. On day 1, the item is discounted by 10%, so the sale price on day 1 is: $100 - (10% of $100) = $90 On day 2, the item is discounted by another 10%, so the sale price on day 2 is: $90 - (10% of $90) = $81 On day 3, the item is discounted by 20%, so the sale price on day 3 is: $81 - (20% of $81) = $64.8 Therefore, the price of the item on day 3 is $64.8, which is 64.8% of the sale price on day 1 ($90). So, the answer is (C) 64.8%. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The Shopkeeper increased the price of a product by 25% so that customer finds it difficult to purchase the required amount. But somehow the customer managed to purchase only 70% of the required amount. What is the net difference in the expenditure on that product? Answer Choices: (A) 12.5% (B) 13% (C) 15% (D) 17% (E) 19%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the original price of the product was $100. After increasing the price by 25%, the new price becomes $125. Now, the customer only purchases 70% of the required amount. This means the customer only spends 70% of the amount they would have spent if they had purchased the required amount. So, the customer spends 70% of $125, which is $87.50. The net difference in expenditure can be calculated by finding the percentage decrease in expenditure. The original expenditure would have been 100% of $125, which is $125. The actual expenditure is $87.50. So, the percentage decrease in expenditure is: ((125 - 87.5)/125) x 100% = 30/125 x 100% = 24% Therefore, the net difference in expenditure is 24%. None of the answer choices match the calculated answer, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: When sold at a 60% discount, a sweater nets the merchant a 20% profit on the wholesale cost at which he initially purchased the item. By what % is the sweater marked up from wholesale at its normal retail price? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 66.67% (D) 80% (E) 100%\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that the wholesale cost of the sweater is $100. If the merchant sells the sweater at a 60% discount, he sells it for 40% of the original price, which is $40. Now, we know that the merchant makes a 20% profit on the wholesale cost at which he initially purchased the item. So, the cost price for the merchant is $100, and he makes a profit of 20%, which is $20. Therefore, the selling price for the merchant is $120. We can now calculate the markup percentage from the wholesale price to the normal retail price. Markup percentage = (Selling price - Wholesale price) / Wholesale price x 100% Markup percentage = ($120 - $100) / $100 x 100% Markup percentage = 20% Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 20%. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: If the selling price is quadrupled,the profit is pentadruple, what is the percentage of profit?? Answer Choices: (A) 50% (B) 100% (C) 150% (D) 200% (E) 250%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the cost price of the item is $100. If the selling price is quadrupled, the new selling price would be $400. Let's say the profit made at the original selling price was $x. If the profit is pentadrupled, the new profit would be $5x. Profit = Selling price - Cost price So, x = Selling price - $100 $5x = $400 - $100 $5x = $300 x = $60 Therefore, the original profit was $60 and the new profit is $300. Percentage increase in profit = (New profit - Original profit) / Original profit * 100 = (300 - 60) / 60 * 100 = 400% So, the answer is (D) 200%. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
