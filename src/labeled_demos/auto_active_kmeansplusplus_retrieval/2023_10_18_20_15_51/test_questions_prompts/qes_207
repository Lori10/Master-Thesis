  "test_question": "Q: A can construct a wall in 40 min and B can construct the wall in 45 min. How many hours is needed to contruct a wall if both the person working together. Answer Choices: (A) 20 min (B) 22 min (C) 23 min (D) 21 min (E) 20 min",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A can do a work in 7 days B in 12 days and C in 5 days. If they work on it together then in how many days required to complete the work? Answer Choices: (A) 420/177 (B) 420/179 (C) 410/87 (D) 90/14 (E) 77/56\nA: Let's think step by step. We can start by finding the individual rates of work for each person. A can do the work in 7 days, so their rate of work is 1/7. B can do the work in 12 days, so their rate of work is 1/12. C can do the work in 5 days, so their rate of work is 1/5. To find the combined rate of work when they work together, we add up their individual rates of work: 1/7 + 1/12 + 1/5 = 60/420 + 35/420 + 84/420 = 179/420 So when they work together, their combined rate of work is 179/420. To find how long it will take them to complete the work, we can use the formula: time = work / rate The work they need to do is 1 (the whole job), and their combined rate of work is 179/420. time = 1 / (179/420) = 420/179 Therefore, the answer is (B) 420/179. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: One fill pipe A is 3 times faster than second fill pipe B and takes 10 minutes less time to fill a cistern than B takes. Find when the cistern will be full if fill pipe B is only opened. Answer Choices: (A) 20 min (B) 18 min (C) 15 min (D) 10 min (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the time taken by fill pipe B to fill the cistern is x minutes. According to the problem, fill pipe A is 3 times faster than fill pipe B. Therefore, the time taken by fill pipe A to fill the cistern will be x/3 minutes. Also, it is given that fill pipe A takes 10 minutes less time than fill pipe B to fill the cistern. Therefore, we can write the equation: x - 10 = x/3 Solving this equation, we get: 2x/3 = 10 x = 15 Therefore, fill pipe B takes 15 minutes to fill the cistern. Hence, the answer is (C) 15 min. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In a game of billiards, A can give B 20 points in 60 and he can give C 30 points in 60. How many points can B give C in a game of 120? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 77 (C) 45 (D) 18 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many points A can give B in a game of 120. We can use the ratio of 20 points in 60 to find out how many points A can give B in 120. 20 points in 60 minutes is equivalent to (20/60) = 1/3 points per minute. Therefore, in 120 minutes, A can give B (1/3 x 120) = 40 points. Now, we need to find out how many points A can give C in a game of 120. Using the same method as above, we get: 30 points in 60 minutes is equivalent to (30/60) = 1/2 points per minute. Therefore, in 120 minutes, A can give C (1/2 x 120) = 60 points. Now, we need to find out how many points B can give C in a game of 120. Let's assume that B can give C x points in 120 minutes. In 120 minutes, A can give B 40 points and A can give C 60 points. Therefore, B can give C (60 - 40) = 20 points in 120 minutes. Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match our calculation. The correct answer is 20. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: It takes 40 identical printing presses 15 hours to print 500,000 papers. How many hours would it take 30 of these printing presses to print 500,000 papers? Answer Choices: (A) 16 (B) 18 (C) 20 (D) 21 (E) 24\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 40 printing presses can print 500,000 papers in 15 hours. So, we can find the rate of printing of each press by dividing the total number of papers by the total number of hours and the number of presses: Rate of each press = 500,000 / (40 x 15) = 833.33 papers per hour Now, we need to find how many hours it would take 30 printing presses to print 500,000 papers at the same rate. Total time = Total number of papers / (Rate of each press x Number of presses) Total time = 500,000 / (833.33 x 30) Total time = 20 hours Therefore, the answer is (C) 20. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
