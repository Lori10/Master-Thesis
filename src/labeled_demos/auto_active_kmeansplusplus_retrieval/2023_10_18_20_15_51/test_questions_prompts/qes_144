  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A student must answer 7 out of 10 questions on an examination. If at least 3 of the first 5 questions must be answered, how many possible combinations of 7 questions are available to the student?\n. Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 80 (C) 110 (D) 220 (E) 360\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that the student must answer 7 out of 10 questions, so we need to find the number of ways to choose 7 questions out of 10. This can be calculated using the combination formula: 10C7 = 10! / (7! * 3!) = 120 So there are 120 possible combinations of 7 questions. Step 2: We also know that at least 3 of the first 5 questions must be answered. This means that the student can either answer 3, 4, or 5 questions from the first 5. Step 3: We need to find the number of ways to choose the remaining questions from the remaining 5. This can be calculated using the combination formula: 5C4 + 5C3 + 5C2 = 5! / (4! * 1!) + 5! / (3! * 2!) + 5! / (2! * 3!) = 5 + 10 + 10 = 25 So there are 25 ways to choose the remaining questions. Step 4: We can now find the total number of possible combinations by multiplying the results from step 2 and step 3: (3C3 * 5C4) + (4C3 * 5C3) + (5C3 * 5C2) = (1 * 5) + (4 * 10) + (10 * 10) = 5 + 40 + 100 = 145 Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the correct answer of 145. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A certain football coach allows his quarterback to call three plays in a row. If the quarterback can choose from 3 passing plays, 4 running plays, and 2 trick plays, how many different N arrangements of plays can be run, if the same play can\u2019t be run more than once? Answer Choices: (A) 24 (B) 125 (C) 243 (D) 504 (E) 729\nA: Let's think step by step. First, the quarterback can choose from 3 passing plays, then 4 running plays, and finally 2 trick plays. Using the multiplication principle, we can find the total number of arrangements by multiplying the number of choices for each step: 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 Therefore, the answer is (A) 24. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: We have 4 people and 1 chairs. In how many ways chairs can be occupy? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 86 (C) 24 (D) 14 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. If we have 4 people and only 1 chair, then only one person can sit on the chair at a time. So, we need to find the number of ways in which we can choose one person out of 4 to sit on the chair. The number of ways to choose one person out of 4 is 4. Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. None of the other options are correct as they are either too high or too low for the given scenario. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A certain restaurant offers 7 kinds of cheese and 2 kinds of fruit for its dessert platter. If each dessert platter contains an equal number of kinds of cheese and kinds of fruit, how many different dessert platters could the restaurant offer? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 12 (C) 15 (D) 21 (E) 35\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 7 kinds of cheese and 2 kinds of fruit. To have an equal number of kinds of cheese and fruit, we need to find the common factors of 7 and 2. The only common factor is 1. Therefore, each dessert platter can have only 1 kind of cheese and 1 kind of fruit. To find the total number of different dessert platters, we need to multiply the number of options for cheese and fruit. There are 7 options for cheese and 2 options for fruit. Therefore, the total number of different dessert platters is 7 x 2 = 14. However, we need to divide this number by 2 because the order of cheese and fruit does not matter. Therefore, the final answer is 14/2 = 7. So, the correct answer is (A) 8. None of the given options match the correct answer. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
