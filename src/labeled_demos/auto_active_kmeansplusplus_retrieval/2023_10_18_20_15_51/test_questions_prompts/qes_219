  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Reena took a loan of Rs. 1200 with simple interest for as many years as the rate of interest. If she paid Rs. 588 as interest at the end of the loan period, what was the rate of interest? Answer Choices: (A) 3.6 (B) 7 (C) 18 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve the problem step by step. Let the rate of interest be x% per year. Then, the time period will also be x years. Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100 Given, Principal = Rs. 1200 and Simple Interest = Rs. 588 Therefore, 588 = (1200 * x * x) / 100 Simplifying the above equation, we get: x^2 = 49 Taking the square root on both sides, we get: x = 7 Hence, the rate of interest is 7% per year. Therefore, the correct answer is option (B) 7. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: How much time will it take for an amount of Rs. 450 to yield Rs. 81 as interest at 4.5 % per annum of simple interest ? Answer Choices: (A) 3.5 years (B) 4 years (C) 4.5 years (D) 5 years (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that Simple Interest (SI) = (P * R * T) / 100, where P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest and T is the time period. Here, P = Rs. 450, SI = Rs. 81 and R = 4.5% Substituting the values in the formula, we get: 81 = (450 * 4.5 * T) / 100 Simplifying this equation, we get: T = (81 * 100) / (450 * 4.5) T = 4 years Therefore, the answer is (B) 4 years. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Mike invested Rs. 3750 in a scheme for 3 years at compound interest rate 6.5% p.a. How much amount will Mike get on maturity of the fixed deposit? Answer Choices: (A) s.4581.29 (B) s.4450 (C) s.4500 (D) s.4500.25 (E) s.4529.81\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the formula for compound interest to solve this problem: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) Where: A = the amount at the end of the investment P = the principal amount (initial investment) r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal) n = the number of times the interest is compounded per year t = the time period of the investment (in years) Plugging in the given values, we get: A = 3750(1 + 0.065/1)^(1*3) A = 3750(1.065)^3 A = 3750(1.207) A = 4522.50 Therefore, the closest answer choice is (E) s.4529.81. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Find the sum The difference between the compound and S.I. on a certain sum of money for 5 years at 20% per annum is Rs.75 of money? Answer Choices: (A) 1489 (B) 6845 (C) 2598 (D) 1875 (E) 2600\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the principal be P. Compound Interest (CI) for 5 years at 20% per annum = P(1 + 20/100)^5 - P = P(1.20)^5 - P Simple Interest (SI) for 5 years at 20% per annum = P x 20/100 x 5 = P Difference between CI and SI = P(1.20)^5 - P - P = P[(1.20)^5 - 2] Given that this difference is Rs. 75. Therefore, P[(1.20)^5 - 2] = 75 P = 75 / [(1.20)^5 - 2] Now, we need to find the sum of the difference between CI and SI for 5 years at 20% per annum. Sum = 5P[(1.20)^5 - 2] = 5 x 75 = 375 Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the calculated sum. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
