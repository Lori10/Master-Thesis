  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The price of an item is discounted 10 percent on day 1 of a sale. On day 2, the item is discounted another 10 percent, and on day 3, it is discounted an additional 20 percent. The price of the item on day 3 is what percentage of the sale price on day 1? Answer Choices: (A) 28% (B) 40% (C) 64.8% (D) 70% (E) 72%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the original price of the item is $100. On day 1, the item is discounted by 10%, so the sale price on day 1 is: $100 - (10% of $100) = $90 On day 2, the item is discounted by another 10%, so the sale price on day 2 is: $90 - (10% of $90) = $81 On day 3, the item is discounted by 20%, so the sale price on day 3 is: $81 - (20% of $81) = $64.8 Therefore, the price of the item on day 3 is $64.8, which is 64.8% of the sale price on day 1 ($90). So, the answer is (C) 64.8%. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Mohit sold an article for Rs. 18000. Had he offered a discount of 10% on the selling price, he would have earned a profit of 8%. What is the cost price of the article? Answer Choices: (A) 15000 (B) 15002 (C) 26879 (D) 26992 (E) 12681\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the cost price of the article be x. If Mohit had offered a discount of 10%, the selling price would have been 90% of the original selling price, which is 0.9 * 18000 = 16200. If he had earned a profit of 8%, the cost price would have been (16200/1.08) = 15000. Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 15000. The correct answer is (A) 15000. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A certain manufacturer increased its gross profit on a product from 10 percent of the cost of the product to 15 percent of the cost by changing the selling price. If the new selling price was $92.00 and the cost of the product remained the same, what was the old selling price? Answer Choices: (A) $77.40 (B) $80.00 (C) $83.64 (D) $87.40 (E) $88.00\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the cost of the product. Let's assume the cost is x. The manufacturer increased its gross profit from 10% to 15%, which means the profit increased by 5% of the cost. So, the new profit is 0.15x and the old profit is 0.10x. We know that the new selling price is $92.00, so we can set up an equation: x + 0.15x = cost + new profit = $92.00 Simplifying the equation: 1.15x = $92.00 x = $80.00 Therefore, the cost of the product is $80.00. To find the old selling price, we need to use the old profit: 0.10x = 0.10($80.00) = $8.00 The old selling price is the cost plus the old profit: $80.00 + $8.00 = $88.00 So, the answer is (E) $88.00. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: The Shopkeeper increased the price of a product by 25% so that customer finds it difficult to purchase the required amount. But somehow the customer managed to purchase only 70% of the required amount. What is the net difference in the expenditure on that product? Answer Choices: (A) 12.5% (B) 13% (C) 15% (D) 17% (E) 19%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the original price of the product was $100. After increasing the price by 25%, the new price becomes $125. Now, the customer only purchases 70% of the required amount. This means the customer only spends 70% of the amount they would have spent if they had purchased the required amount. So, the customer spends 70% of $125, which is $87.50. The net difference in expenditure can be calculated by finding the percentage decrease in expenditure. The original expenditure would have been 100% of $125, which is $125. The actual expenditure is $87.50. So, the percentage decrease in expenditure is: ((125 - 87.5)/125) x 100% = 30/125 x 100% = 24% Therefore, the net difference in expenditure is 24%. None of the answer choices match the calculated answer, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
