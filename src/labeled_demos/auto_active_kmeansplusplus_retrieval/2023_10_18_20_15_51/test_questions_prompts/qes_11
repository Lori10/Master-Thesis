  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Mohit sold an article for Rs. 18000. Had he offered a discount of 10% on the selling price, he would have earned a profit of 8%. What is the cost price of the article? Answer Choices: (A) 15000 (B) 15002 (C) 26879 (D) 26992 (E) 12681\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the cost price of the article be x. If Mohit had offered a discount of 10%, the selling price would have been 90% of the original selling price, which is 0.9 * 18000 = 16200. If he had earned a profit of 8%, the cost price would have been (16200/1.08) = 15000. Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 15000. The correct answer is (A) 15000. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The price of an item is discounted 10 percent on day 1 of a sale. On day 2, the item is discounted another 10 percent, and on day 3, it is discounted an additional 20 percent. The price of the item on day 3 is what percentage of the sale price on day 1? Answer Choices: (A) 28% (B) 40% (C) 64.8% (D) 70% (E) 72%\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the original price of the item is $100. On day 1, the item is discounted by 10%, so the sale price on day 1 is: $100 - (10% of $100) = $90 On day 2, the item is discounted by another 10%, so the sale price on day 2 is: $90 - (10% of $90) = $81 On day 3, the item is discounted by 20%, so the sale price on day 3 is: $81 - (20% of $81) = $64.8 Therefore, the price of the item on day 3 is $64.8, which is 64.8% of the sale price on day 1 ($90). So, the answer is (C) 64.8%. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A certain manufacturer increased its gross profit on a product from 10 percent of the cost of the product to 15 percent of the cost by changing the selling price. If the new selling price was $92.00 and the cost of the product remained the same, what was the old selling price? Answer Choices: (A) $77.40 (B) $80.00 (C) $83.64 (D) $87.40 (E) $88.00\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the cost of the product. Let's assume the cost is x. The manufacturer increased its gross profit from 10% to 15%, which means the profit increased by 5% of the cost. So, the new profit is 0.15x and the old profit is 0.10x. We know that the new selling price is $92.00, so we can set up an equation: x + 0.15x = cost + new profit = $92.00 Simplifying the equation: 1.15x = $92.00 x = $80.00 Therefore, the cost of the product is $80.00. To find the old selling price, we need to use the old profit: 0.10x = 0.10($80.00) = $8.00 The old selling price is the cost plus the old profit: $80.00 + $8.00 = $88.00 So, the answer is (E) $88.00. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A woman sold 300 oranges at $12.10, some at the rate of 3 for 35 cents and the rest at 7 for 85 cents. How many were sold at the first rate? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 21 (C) 9 (D) 15 (E) 13\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. Let the number of oranges sold at the rate of 3 for 35 cents be x. Then, the number of oranges sold at the rate of 7 for 85 cents would be 300 - x. The total amount earned from selling x oranges at the rate of 3 for 35 cents would be (x/3) * 0.35 dollars. Similarly, the total amount earned from selling (300 - x) oranges at the rate of 7 for 85 cents would be (7/85) * (300 - x) dollars. The total amount earned from selling all 300 oranges would be $12.10. So, we can write the equation: (x/3) * 0.35 + (7/85) * (300 - x) = 12.10 Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 45 Therefore, the number of oranges sold at the rate of 3 for 35 cents is 45. Hence, the answer is (A) 45. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
