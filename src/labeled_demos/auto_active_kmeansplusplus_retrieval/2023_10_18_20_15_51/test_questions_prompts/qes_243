  "test_question": "Q: At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle? Answer Choices: (A) 50 m (B) 75 m (C) 100 m (D) 125 m (E) 150 m",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A train 700 m long is running at a speed of 78 km/hr. If it crosses a tunnel in 1 min, then the length of the tunnel is? Answer Choices: (A) 298 m (B) 468 m (C) 600 m (D) 667 m (E) 781 m\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s. 78 km/hr = (78 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 21.67 m/s Next, we need to find the time taken by the train to cross the tunnel. We know that the length of the train is 700 m and it crosses the tunnel in 1 min (60 seconds). Therefore, the speed of the train relative to the tunnel is: Speed = Distance / Time Speed = (700 + Length of tunnel) / 60 Speed = (700 + Length of tunnel) / 60 Multiplying both sides by 60: Speed x 60 = 700 + Length of tunnel 21.67 x 60 = 700 + Length of tunnel 1300.2 - 700 = Length of tunnel Length of tunnel = 600.2 m Therefore, the length of the tunnel is approximately 600 m. The closest answer choice is (C) 600 m. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A man walking at a rate of 5km/hr crosses a bridge in 15 minutes. The length of the bridge is? Answer Choices: (A) 1250m (B) 1310m (C) 1500m (D) 1000m (E) 1195m\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the man's speed from km/hr to m/min since the answer choices are in meters. 5 km/hr = 5000 m/hr (since 1 km = 1000 m) 5000 m/hr = 83.33 m/min (since 1 hr = 60 min) Next, we need to use the formula: distance = speed x time We know the speed is 83.33 m/min and the time is 15 minutes. Let's plug those values in: distance = 83.33 m/min x 15 min distance = 1250 m Therefore, the length of the bridge is 1250m. The correct answer is (A) 1250m. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: If a truck is traveling at a constant rate of 54 kilometers per hour, how many seconds will it take the truck to travel a distance of 600 meters? (1 kilometer = 1000 meters) Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 24 (C) 30 (D) 36 (E) 40\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the truck from kilometers per hour to meters per second since the distance given is in meters. 54 kilometers per hour = 54,000 meters per hour (since 1 kilometer = 1000 meters) = 15 meters per second (since 1 hour = 3600 seconds) Now, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time Plugging in the values we have: 600 meters = 15 meters per second x time Solving for time: time = 600 meters / 15 meters per second time = 40 seconds Therefore, the answer is (E) 40. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A passenger sitting near the window in a train moving at 40 km/h, noticed that it took 3 sec. for the oncoming train to pass by. What was the speed of the oncoming train if the length of the oncoming train was 69 metres? Answer Choices: (A) a) 50km/h (B) b) 42.8km/h (C) c) 56km/h (D) d) 60km/h (E) e) 70km/h\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/h to m/s, since the length of the oncoming train is given in meters and the time taken to pass by is given in seconds. 40 km/h = (40 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 11.11 m/s Next, we can use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time to find the speed of the oncoming train. Distance = length of oncoming train = 69 m Time = 3 sec Speed = 69 / 3 = 23 m/s Finally, we need to convert the speed of the oncoming train from m/s to km/h. 23 m/s = (23 x 60 x 60) / 1000 km/h = 82.8 km/h Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
