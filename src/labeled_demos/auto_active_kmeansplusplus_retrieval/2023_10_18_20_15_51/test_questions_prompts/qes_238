  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A student must answer 7 out of 10 questions on an examination. If at least 3 of the first 5 questions must be answered, how many possible combinations of 7 questions are available to the student?\n. Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 80 (C) 110 (D) 220 (E) 360\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that the student must answer 7 out of 10 questions, so we need to find the number of ways to choose 7 questions out of 10. This can be calculated using the combination formula: 10C7 = 10! / (7! * 3!) = 120 So there are 120 possible combinations of 7 questions. Step 2: We also know that at least 3 of the first 5 questions must be answered. This means that the student can either answer 3, 4, or 5 questions from the first 5. Step 3: We need to find the number of ways to choose the remaining questions from the remaining 5. This can be calculated using the combination formula: 5C4 + 5C3 + 5C2 = 5! / (4! * 1!) + 5! / (3! * 2!) + 5! / (2! * 3!) = 5 + 10 + 10 = 25 So there are 25 ways to choose the remaining questions. Step 4: We can now find the total number of possible combinations by multiplying the results from step 2 and step 3: (3C3 * 5C4) + (4C3 * 5C3) + (5C3 * 5C2) = (1 * 5) + (4 * 10) + (10 * 10) = 5 + 40 + 100 = 145 Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the correct answer of 145. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: We have 4 people and 1 chairs. In how many ways chairs can be occupy? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 86 (C) 24 (D) 14 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. If we have 4 people and only 1 chair, then only one person can sit on the chair at a time. So, we need to find the number of ways in which we can choose one person out of 4 to sit on the chair. The number of ways to choose one person out of 4 is 4. Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. None of the other options are correct as they are either too high or too low for the given scenario. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In how many ways can 6 apples (identical) be distributed among 5 children? (Some children may get no apples.) Answer Choices: (A) 124 (B) 210 (C) 128 (D) 130 (E) 132\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the stars and bars method to solve this problem. We need to distribute 6 identical apples among 5 children, which means we need to place 4 dividers (bars) among the 6 apples to separate them into 5 groups. For example, if we place the dividers like this: * | * * | * * * it means the first child gets 1 apple, the second child gets 2 apples, the third child gets 3 apples, the fourth child gets 0 apples, and the fifth child gets 0 apples. The number of ways to place 4 dividers among 6 apples is the same as the number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 10 (6 apples and 4 dividers). This can be calculated as: 10 choose 4 = 10! / (4! * 6!) = 210 Therefore, the answer is (B) 210. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A certain ski shop sells pairs of gloves in 10 different colors. If one pair of each color is dropped in a bag and a store clerk reaches in to draw two individual gloves simultaneously and at random, what is the probability that she draws two gloves of the same color? Answer Choices: (A) 1/144 (B) 1/143 (C) 1/24 (D) 1/23 (E) 1/19\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. There are 10 different colors of gloves, so there are 10 pairs of gloves in total. When the store clerk reaches in to draw two individual gloves simultaneously and at random, there are a total of 20 gloves in the bag. To calculate the probability of drawing two gloves of the same color, we need to first calculate the total number of possible outcomes. The total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to choose 2 gloves out of 20, which is: 20 choose 2 = (20 * 19) / (2 * 1) = 190 Next, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to choose 2 gloves of the same color. There are 10 different colors to choose from, so the number of ways to choose 2 gloves of the same color is: 10 choose 1 = 10 For each color, there are 2 gloves to choose from, so the total number of ways to choose 2 gloves of the same color is: 10 * (2 choose 2) = 10 Therefore, the probability of drawing two gloves of the same color is: 10 / 190 = 1/19 So the correct answer is (E) 1/19. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
