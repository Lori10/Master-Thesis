Q is the product of two prime numbers. Answer Choices: (A) I only (B) III only (C) II only (D) I and II only (E) I and III only",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: if integer N has p factors ; how many factors will 5N have ? Answer Choices: (A) p (B) 2p (C) P+1 (D) 2p+1 (E) Cannot be determined\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that N has p factors. This means that N can be written as a product of p distinct prime numbers raised to various powers. For example, if N = 12, then N can be written as 2^2 * 3^1, which means that N has (2+1) * (1+1) = 6 factors (2 and 3 can each be raised to 0, 1, or 2). Now, let's consider 5N. 5N can be written as 5 * N, which means that 5N has one more factor than N (since 5 is a prime factor of 5N that wasn't present in N). Therefore, the answer is (C) p+1. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If y is the smallest positive integer such that 6300 multiplied by y is the square of an integer, then y must be Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 7 (C) 15 (D) 35 (E) 45\nA: Let's think step by step. We need to find the smallest positive integer y such that 6300 multiplied by y is the square of an integer. Let's factor 6300: 6300 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2 * 7 To be a perfect square, each prime factor must have an even exponent. Therefore, we need to add one factor of 7 to make the exponent of 7 even. So, y = 7. Therefore, the answer is (B) 7. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If the LCM of 9, 7, 2, and q is 504, which of the following could be q? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 6 (D) 9 (E) 5\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the prime factorization of 504: 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7 Next, we need to make sure that q is a factor of 504. Since 504 is divisible by 9, 7, and 2, q must also be a factor of 504. Option A: 7 is already a factor of 504, so it could be q. Option B: 8 is not a factor of 504. Option C: 6 is a factor of 504, but it is not the least common multiple of 9, 7, and 2. Option D: 9 is already a factor of 504, so it could be q. Option E: 5 is not a factor of 504. Therefore, the possible values of q are 7 and 9. Answer: (A) 7 or (D) 9. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If a and b are consecutive integers (b>a), which of the following statements could be false? 1. a^2+b is an even number. 2. ab is even number 3. (a + b) is always an odd number. Answer Choices: (A) II only (B) III only (C) I,II only (D) I only (E) I,III only\nA: Let's think step by step. If a and b are consecutive integers, then b = a + 1. 1. a^2 + b = a^2 + (a + 1) = (a^2 + a) + 1. Since a(a+1) is always even, the sum of an even number and 1 is always odd. Therefore, statement 1 is always true. 2. ab = a(a+1) is the product of two consecutive integers. One of them must be even and the other odd. Therefore, the product is always even. Statement 2 is always true. 3. a + b = a + (a+1) = 2a + 1. Since a is an integer, 2a is always even. Therefore, 2a + 1 is always odd. Statement 3 is always true. Therefore, none of the statements could be false. The answer is (E) None of the above. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
