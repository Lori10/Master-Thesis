  "test_question": "Q: Two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. If 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. The smaller number is? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 33 (C) 35 (D) 42 (E) 58",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: What number has a 5:1 ratio to the number 10? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 50 (C) 99 (D) 72 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. The ratio of two numbers is the quotient of the two numbers. Here, we are given that the ratio of the unknown number to 10 is 5:1. So, we can set up the equation: x/10 = 5/1 where x is the unknown number. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: x = 10 * 5 x = 50 Therefore, the number that has a 5:1 ratio to the number 10 is 50. The correct answer is (B) 50. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If 288 is divided into four parts proportional to 5, 7, 4, 8 then the smallest part is : Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 44 (C) 20 (D) 48 (E) 42\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total proportion: 5 + 7 + 4 + 8 = 24 Next, we need to find the proportion of each part: 5/24, 7/24, 4/24, 8/24 Simplifying these fractions, we get: 5/24, 7/24, 1/6, 1/3 Now, we can find the value of each part by multiplying its proportion by the total value: 5/24 x 288 = 60 7/24 x 288 = 84 1/6 x 288 = 48 1/3 x 288 = 96 Therefore, the smallest part is 48, which corresponds to the proportion of 1/6. The correct answer is (D) 48. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Two-third of two-fifth of three-fourth of a number is 36. What is the square root of four-fifth of that number? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 12 (C) 14 (D) 16 (E) 18\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to translate the word problem into an equation. Two-third of two-fifth of three-fourth of a number can be written as: (2/3) * (2/5) * (3/4) * x = 36 Simplifying this expression, we get: (1/5) * x = 36 Multiplying both sides by 5, we get: x = 180 Now, we need to find the square root of four-fifth of that number: \u221a((4/5) * 180) Simplifying this expression, we get: \u221a(144) Which is equal to 12. Therefore, the answer is (B) 12. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Seventy five percent of a number is 21 less than four fifth of that number. What is the number ? Answer Choices: (A) 240 (B) 340 (C) 420 (D) 130 (E) 125\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the number to be 'x'. According to the problem, 75% of the number is 21 less than 4/5 of the number. Translating this into an equation: 0.75x = (4/5)x - 21 Simplifying this equation: 0.75x - (4/5)x = -21 (15/20)x - (16/20)x = -21 (-1/20)x = -21 x = (-21) * (-20) x = 420 Therefore, the answer is (C) 420. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
