  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In order to obtain an income of Rs. 650 from 10% stock at Rs. 96, one must make an investment of Answer Choices: (A) 5363 (B) 6240 (C) 2368 (D) 1987 (E) 2732\nA: Let's think step by step. The annual income from the stock is 10% of the investment. So, we can set up the equation: 10% of the investment = Rs. 650 0.1 x investment = 650 investment = 650 / 0.1 investment = Rs. 6,500 Now, we need to find out how many shares can be bought with an investment of Rs. 6,500 at Rs. 96 per share. Number of shares = investment / share price Number of shares = 6,500 / 96 Number of shares = 67.71 (approx.) Since we cannot buy a fraction of a share, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Number of shares = 68 Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 2732, which is the total investment required to buy 68 shares at Rs. 96 per share. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Rahim bought 65 books for Rs.1150 from one shop and 50 books for Rs.920 from another. What is the average price he paid per book ? Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 18 (C) 99 (D) 787 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total cost of all the books Rahim bought. Total cost = Rs.1150 + Rs.920 = Rs.2070 Next, we need to find the total number of books Rahim bought. Total number of books = 65 + 50 = 115 Finally, we can find the average price per book by dividing the total cost by the total number of books. Average price per book = Total cost / Total number of books Average price per book = Rs.2070 / 115 Average price per book = Rs.18 Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 18. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Mike invested Rs. 3750 in a scheme for 3 years at compound interest rate 6.5% p.a. How much amount will Mike get on maturity of the fixed deposit? Answer Choices: (A) s.4581.29 (B) s.4450 (C) s.4500 (D) s.4500.25 (E) s.4529.81\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the formula for compound interest to solve this problem: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) Where: A = the amount at the end of the investment P = the principal amount (initial investment) r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal) n = the number of times the interest is compounded per year t = the time period of the investment (in years) Plugging in the given values, we get: A = 3750(1 + 0.065/1)^(1*3) A = 3750(1.065)^3 A = 3750(1.207) A = 4522.50 Therefore, the closest answer choice is (E) s.4529.81. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A money lender finds that due to a fall in the annual rate of interest from 8% to 7 3/4 % his yearly income diminishes by Rs. 60.50, his capital is?

Then, 8% of x - 7.75% of x = 60.50 0.25% of x = 60.50 1% of x = 60.50/0.25 x = 24,200 Therefore, the answer is (A) 24,200. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
