The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5(\u221a3 + 1)  (B) 6(\u221a3 + \u221a2)  (C) 7(\u221a3 \u2013 1)  (D) 8(\u221a3 \u2013 2)  (E) None of these",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: What would happen in the previous question if both A and B had started at point P. Answer Choices: (A) 800 Km (B) 600 Km (C) 1000 Km (D) 350 Km (E) 250 Km\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that A travels at a speed of 50 km/h and B travels at a speed of 40 km/h. If they both started at point P, they would be moving in opposite directions. Let's say they meet after x hours. In that time, A would have traveled 50x km and B would have traveled 40x km. We also know that the distance between A and B is 600 km. So, we can set up the equation: 50x + 40x = 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 90x = 600 x = 6.67 hours Now that we know they meet after 6.67 hours, we can find out how far each of them has traveled: A: 50 km/h x 6.67 h = 333.33 km B: 40 km/h x 6.67 h = 266.67 km The total distance they have traveled is: 333.33 km + 266.67 km = 600 km Therefore, the answer is (B) 600 km. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: An object thrown directly upward is at a height of h feet after t seconds, where h = -15 (t-2)^2 + 150. At what height, in feet, is the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 90 (C) 124 (D) 132 (E) 140\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the maximum height of the object. We can do this by finding the vertex of the quadratic equation h = -15(t-2)^2 + 150. The vertex of a quadratic equation in the form of h = a(t-b)^2 + c is (b, c). In this case, the vertex is (2, 150). This means that the object reaches its maximum height of 150 feet after 2 seconds. Next, we need to find the height of the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height. We can do this by plugging in t = 4 (2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height) into the equation h = -15(t-2)^2 + 150. h = -15(4-2)^2 + 150 h = -15(2)^2 + 150 h = -60 + 150 h = 90 Therefore, the height of the object 2 seconds after it reaches its maximum height is 90 feet. The correct answer is (B) 90. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A car covers a distance of 624 km in 2 2/5 hours. Find its speed? Answer Choices: (A) 104 kmph (B) 194 kmph (C) 109 kmph (D) 260 kmph (E) 271 kmph\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that speed = distance/time. Here, the distance covered by the car is 624 km and the time taken is 2 2/5 hours. To convert the mixed fraction to an improper fraction, we can multiply the whole number (2) by the denominator (5) and add the numerator (2) to get 12/5. So, time taken = 12/5 hours. Now, we can substitute these values in the formula: Speed = distance/time Speed = 624/(12/5) Speed = 624 * 5/12 Speed = 260 kmph Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 260 kmph. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If a truck is traveling at a constant rate of 54 kilometers per hour, how many seconds will it take the truck to travel a distance of 600 meters? (1 kilometer = 1000 meters) Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 24 (C) 30 (D) 36 (E) 40\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the truck from kilometers per hour to meters per second since the distance given is in meters. 54 kilometers per hour = 54,000 meters per hour (since 1 kilometer = 1000 meters) = 15 meters per second (since 1 hour = 3600 seconds) Now, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time Plugging in the values we have: 600 meters = 15 meters per second x time Solving for time: time = 600 meters / 15 meters per second time = 40 seconds Therefore, the answer is (E) 40. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
