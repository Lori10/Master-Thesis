  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A part-time employee whose hourly wage was decreased by 20 percent decided to increase the number of hours worked per week so that the employee's total income did not change. By what percent E should the number of hours worked be increased? Answer Choices: (A) 12.5% (B) 20% (C) 25% (D) 50% (E) 100%\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that the employee originally worked for x hours per week and earned y dollars per week. After the wage decrease of 20%, the employee's new hourly wage is 0.8y/x dollars per hour. To maintain the same total income, the employee needs to work for more hours. Let's call the new number of hours worked per week E. The employee's new weekly income is (0.8y/x) * E dollars. We want to find the percentage increase in the number of hours worked, which is given by: (E - x)/x * 100% Setting the new weekly income equal to the original weekly income, we get: (0.8y/x) * E = y Solving for E, we get: E = 1.25x Therefore, the percentage increase in the number of hours worked is: (E - x)/x * 100% = (1.25x - x)/x * 100% = 0.25 * 100% = 25% So the answer is (C) 25%. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The average salary/head of all the workers ina workshop is Rs.850, if the average salary/head of 7technician is Rs.1000 and the average salary/head of the rest is Rs.780, the total no. of workers in the work-shop is ? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 23 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the total number of workers in the workshop be x. We know that the average salary/head of all workers is Rs. 850. So, the total salary of all workers = 850x. We also know that the average salary/head of 7 technicians is Rs. 1000. So, the total salary of these 7 technicians = 1000 x 7 = 7000. Now, we can find the total salary of the remaining workers by subtracting the total salary of the technicians from the total salary of all workers: Total salary of remaining workers = 850x - 7000. We also know that the average salary/head of the remaining workers is Rs. 780. So, we can set up an equation: (850x - 7000) / (x - 7) = 780 Solving for x, we get x = 22. Therefore, the total number of workers in the workshop is 22. The answer is (C) 22. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A can do a work in 7 days B in 12 days and C in 5 days. If they work on it together then in how many days required to complete the work? Answer Choices: (A) 420/177 (B) 420/179 (C) 410/87 (D) 90/14 (E) 77/56\nA: Let's think step by step. We can start by finding the individual rates of work for each person. A can do the work in 7 days, so their rate of work is 1/7. B can do the work in 12 days, so their rate of work is 1/12. C can do the work in 5 days, so their rate of work is 1/5. To find the combined rate of work when they work together, we add up their individual rates of work: 1/7 + 1/12 + 1/5 = 60/420 + 35/420 + 84/420 = 179/420 So when they work together, their combined rate of work is 179/420. To find how long it will take them to complete the work, we can use the formula: time = work / rate The work they need to do is 1 (the whole job), and their combined rate of work is 179/420. time = 1 / (179/420) = 420/179 Therefore, the answer is (B) 420/179. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A meal cost $ 37.25 adn there was no tax. If the tip was more than 10 pc but less than 15pc of the price, then the total amount paid should be: Answer Choices: (A) 42-45 (B) 41-43 (C) 39-41 (D) 37-39 (E) 36-37\nA: Let's think step by step. The meal cost is $37.25 and there is no tax. Let's assume the tip is x% of the meal cost. So, the total amount paid will be: $37.25 + (x/100)*$37.25 Simplifying this expression: $37.25*(1 + x/100)$ We know that the tip is more than 10% but less than 15% of the price. So, 10% < x < 15% Let's substitute the values of x in the expression we derived above: For x = 10%, the total amount paid will be: $37.25*(1 + 10/100) = $41. For x = 15%, the total amount paid will be: $37.25*(1 + 15/100) = $42.79. Therefore, the total amount paid should be between $41 and $42.79. The closest answer choice is (A) 42-45. So, the correct answer is (A) 42-45. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
