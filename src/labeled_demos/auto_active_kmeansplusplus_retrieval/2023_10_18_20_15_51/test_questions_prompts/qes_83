  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Eleven bags are bought for Rs.1000 and sold at 10 for Rs.1500. What is the gain or loss in percentage? Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 21% (C) 26% (D) 20% (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve the problem step by step. Let the cost price of one bag be x. So, the cost price of 11 bags will be 11x. The bags are sold at 10 for Rs.1500. So, the selling price of 10 bags will be Rs.1500. Therefore, the selling price of 1 bag will be Rs.150. So, the selling price of 11 bags will be 11 x Rs.150 = Rs.1650. Now, we can calculate the profit or loss percentage using the formula: Profit or loss percentage = (Profit or loss / Cost price) x 100 Profit or loss = Selling price - Cost price Cost price of 11 bags = Rs.1000 Selling price of 11 bags = Rs.1650 Profit or loss = Rs.1650 - Rs.1000 = Rs.650 Profit or loss percentage = (650/1000) x 100 = 65% Therefore, the answer is None of the above, as none of the given options match the calculated profit or loss percentage of 65%. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: By selling 300 apples a seller gains the selling price of 60 apples. The gain percent of the seller is Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 88 (C) 25 (D) 27 (E) 19\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the selling price of one apple is $1. Therefore, the selling price of 300 apples is $300 and the selling price of 60 apples is $60. The seller gains the selling price of 60 apples, which is $60. Profit percent = (Profit/Cost Price) x 100 Here, the profit is $60 and the cost price is the selling price of 240 apples (300-60), which is $240. Profit percent = (60/240) x 100 = 25% Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 25. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A shopkeeper sells his goods at cost price but uses a faulty meter that weighs 800 grams. Find the profit percent. Answer Choices: (A) 100/17% (B) 100/23% (C) 100/19% (D) 100/4% (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve the problem step by step. Let's assume that the cost price of the goods is $100. But the shopkeeper uses a faulty meter that weighs 800 grams instead of 1 kilogram (1000 grams). So, the customer gets only 800 grams of goods for the price of 1 kilogram. To find the selling price of 1 kilogram of goods, we can use the formula: Selling price = Cost price / (Weight of goods / Weight sold) Selling price = 100 / (1000 / 800) = $80 So, the shopkeeper is selling 1 kilogram of goods at $80, which is the cost price of 800 grams of goods. Now, let's calculate the profit percent: Profit = Selling price - Cost price = $80 - $100 = -$20 The profit is negative because the shopkeeper is selling the goods at cost price. Profit percent = (Profit / Cost price) x 100 = (-$20 / $100) x 100 = -20% So, the answer is (E) None of these, as none of the given options match the calculated profit percent of -20%. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A certain manufacturer increased its gross profit on a product from 10 percent of the cost of the product to 15 percent of the cost by changing the selling price. If the new selling price was $92.00 and the cost of the product remained the same, what was the old selling price? Answer Choices: (A) $77.40 (B) $80.00 (C) $83.64 (D) $87.40 (E) $88.00\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the cost of the product. Let's assume the cost is x. The manufacturer increased its gross profit from 10% to 15%, which means the profit increased by 5% of the cost. So, the new profit is 0.15x and the old profit is 0.10x. We know that the new selling price is $92.00, so we can set up an equation: x + 0.15x = cost + new profit = $92.00 Simplifying the equation: 1.15x = $92.00 x = $80.00 Therefore, the cost of the product is $80.00. To find the old selling price, we need to use the old profit: 0.10x = 0.10($80.00) = $8.00 The old selling price is the cost plus the old profit: $80.00 + $8.00 = $88.00 So, the answer is (E) $88.00. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
