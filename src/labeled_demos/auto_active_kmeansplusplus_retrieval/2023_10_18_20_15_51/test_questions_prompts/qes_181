  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The mean of (54,824)^2 and (54,826)^2 = Answer Choices: (A) (54,821) ^2 (B) (54,821.5) ^2 (C) (54,820.5) ^2 (D) (54,825) ^2 + 1 (E) (54,821) ^2 \u2013 1\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the square of 54,824 and 54,826. 54,824^2 = 2,999,998,976 54,826^2 = 3,000,005,476 Next, we need to find the mean of these two numbers. Mean = (2,999,998,976 + 3,000,005,476) / 2 Mean = 2,999,999,226 Now, we need to find the square of this mean. Mean^2 = (2,999,999,226)^2 Mean^2 = 8,999,997,999,520,676 Therefore, the answer is (A) (54,821)^2. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: How many 4-digit Q numbers (ABCD) can be formed such that |A \u2013 D| = 2? Answer Choices: (A) 2,000 (B) 1,900 (C) 1,800 (D) 1,600 (E) 1,500\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that |A \u2013 D| = 2. This means that A and D are either 2 digits apart or 2 digits away from each other in the number line. Case 1: A is 2 digits greater than D. In this case, we can choose any digit from 1 to 9 for D (since it's a 4-digit number, we can't have 0 as the first digit). Then, A can be any digit that is 2 greater than D, except for 9 (since we can't have a 5th digit). So, there are 8 choices for A. Case 2: D is 2 digits greater than A. This is the same as Case 1, but with A and D switched. So, there are also 8 choices for A in this case. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit Q numbers that can be formed is 8 + 8 = 16. The answer is (D) 1,600. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If 9210 - 9124 = 210-square, the value represented by the square is Answer Choices: (A) 296 (B) 210 (C) 186 (D) 124 (E) 24\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the difference between 9210 and 9124: 9210 - 9124 = 86 Next, we know that 210 is equal to the square of a number, so we need to find that number. We can do this by taking the square root of 210: sqrt(210) \u2248 14.49 However, we need to find the value represented by the square, not the square root. To do this, we need to square 14.49: 14.49^2 \u2248 210.02 So the value represented by the square is approximately 210.02, which is closest to answer choice (B) 210. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: The sum of the first 50 positive even integers is 2550. What is the sum of the even integers from 302 to 400 inclusive? Answer Choices: (A) 11,550 (B) 14,550 (C) 17,550 (D) 20,550 (E) 23,550\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the sum of the first 50 positive even integers. We know that the first even integer is 2, the second is 4, the third is 6, and so on. So, we can write the sum as: 2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 98 + 100 = 2550 Next, we need to find the sum of the even integers from 302 to 400 inclusive. We can start by finding the sum of all even integers from 2 to 400, and then subtracting the sum of all even integers from 2 to 300. This will give us the sum of even integers from 302 to 400. The sum of all even integers from 2 to 400 can be found using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = (n/2)(a + l) where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term. In this case, a = 2, l = 400, and n = (400 - 2)/2 + 1 = 200. So, we have: S1 = (200/2)(2 + 400) = 40200 Next, we need to find the sum of all even integers from 2 to 300. Using the same formula, we have: S2 = (150/2)(2 + 300) = 22650 Finally, we can find the sum of even integers from 302 to 400 by subtracting S2 from S1: S3 = S1 - S2 = 40200 - 22650 = 17550 Therefore, the answer is (C) 17,550. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
