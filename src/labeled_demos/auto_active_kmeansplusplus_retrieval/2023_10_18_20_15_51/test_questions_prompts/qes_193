  "test_question": "Q: A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper? Answer Choices: (A) 8.75 (B) 8.79 (C) 8.75 (D) 8.71 (E) 8.72",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A 25 cm wide path is to be made around a circular garden having a diameter of 4 meters. Approximate area of the path is square meters is? Answer Choices: (A) 3.34 sq m (B) 2.98 sq m (C) 9.98 sq m (D) 1.98 sq m (E) 3.78 sq m\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the radius of the circular garden. We know that the diameter is 4 meters, so the radius is half of that, which is 2 meters. Next, we need to find the radius of the garden plus the width of the path. The width of the path is given as 25 cm, which is 0.25 meters. So, the radius of the garden plus the width of the path is 2 + 0.25 = 2.25 meters. Now, we can find the area of the path by subtracting the area of the garden from the area of the larger circle with radius 2.25 meters. The area of the garden is \u03c0r^2 = \u03c0(2)^2 = 4\u03c0 square meters. The area of the larger circle is \u03c0(2.25)^2 = 5.06\u03c0 square meters. So, the area of the path is 5.06\u03c0 - 4\u03c0 = 1.06\u03c0 square meters. Finally, we can approximate this value using 3.14 as an approximation for \u03c0. So, the area of the path is approximately 1.06 x 3.14 = 3.3244 square meters, which is closest to answer choice (A) 3.34 sq m. Therefore, the answer is (A) 3.34 sq m. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A wire in the form of a circle of radius 3.5 m is bent in the form of a rectangule, whose length and breadth are in the ratio of 6 : 5. What is the area of the rectangle? Answer Choices: (A) 70 cm2 (B) 30 cm2 (C) 66 cm2 (D) 55 cm2 (E) 54 cm2\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length and breadth of the rectangle. Let the length be 6x and the breadth be 5x. The perimeter of the circle is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle. Perimeter of circle = 2\u03c0r = 2\u03c0(3.5) = 7\u03c0 Perimeter of rectangle = 2(6x + 5x) = 22x So, 22x = 7\u03c0 x = 7\u03c0/22 Now, length = 6x = 6(7\u03c0/22) = 21\u03c0/11 Breadth = 5x = 5(7\u03c0/22) = 35\u03c0/22 Area of rectangle = length x breadth = (21\u03c0/11) x (35\u03c0/22) = 735\u03c0^2/242 This is approximately equal to 76.2 m^2. None of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: The sides of a rectangular region measured to the nearest centimeter are 8 cm and 5 cm. Out of the following which is the largest possible value of actual area of rectangle ? Answer Choices: (A) 48 (B) 55.25 (C) 52.29 (D) 44 (E) 41.25\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that the actual length and width of the rectangle must be somewhere between 7.5 cm and 8.5 cm for the 8 cm measurement, and between 4.5 cm and 5.5 cm for the 5 cm measurement. To find the largest possible area, we want to use the largest possible length and width within these ranges. The largest possible length is 8.5 cm and the largest possible width is 5.5 cm. So, the largest possible area is 8.5 cm x 5.5 cm = 46.75 cm^2. Out of the given answer choices, the closest one to 46.75 is (D) 44. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 44. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A circular mat with diameter 3.5 inches is placed on a square tabletop, each of whose sides is 6 inches long. Which of the following is closest to the fraction of the tabletop covered by the mat? Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 1 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) 5\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the area of the circular mat. The formula for the area of a circle is A = \u03c0r^2, where r is the radius. The diameter of the mat is 3.5 inches, so the radius is half of that, which is 1.75 inches. Therefore, the area of the mat is: A = \u03c0(1.75)^2 A \u2248 9.62 square inches Next, we need to find the area of the tabletop. The formula for the area of a square is A = s^2, where s is the length of a side. The sides of the tabletop are 6 inches long, so the area of the tabletop is: A = 6^2 A = 36 square inches To find the fraction of the tabletop covered by the mat, we need to divide the area of the mat by the area of the tabletop: 9.62 / 36 \u2248 0.267 This means that the mat covers approximately 26.7% of the tabletop. None of the answer choices given match this result, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
