  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Twenty times a positive integer is more than its square by 96, then the positive integer is Answer Choices: (A) 13 (B) 10 (C) 11 (D) 12 (E) 14\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the positive integer to be x. According to the problem, 20x = x^2 + 96 Rearranging the terms, we get x^2 - 20x + 96 = 0 Now, we can solve this quadratic equation using factorization or the quadratic formula. Using factorization, we can write x^2 - 12x - 8x + 96 = 0 x(x - 12) - 8(x - 12) = 0 (x - 8)(x - 12) = 0 Therefore, x = 8 or x = 12. Out of the given answer choices, the correct option is (D) 12. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: The average of 20 numbers is zero. Of them, at the most, how many may be greater than zero? Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 10 (D) 19 (E) None of the above\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. Let's assume that there are 'n' numbers greater than zero. If the average of 20 numbers is zero, then the sum of all 20 numbers must be zero. Let's say the sum of the 'n' positive numbers is 'x' and the sum of the remaining (20-n) negative numbers is '-x'. So, we can write an equation as: x - (20-n)x/n = 0 Simplifying this equation, we get: n >= 10 Therefore, the maximum number of positive numbers can be 10. Hence, the answer is (C) 10. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If the sum of a number and its square is 182, what is the number? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 26 (C) 28 (D) 91 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the number is x. According to the problem, we know that: x + x^2 = 182 Now, we need to solve for x. Let's rearrange the equation: x^2 + x - 182 = 0 We can factor this quadratic equation: (x + 14)(x - 13) = 0 So, the possible values of x are -14 and 13. However, we are looking for a positive number, so the answer is: x = 13 Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 26. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If (x \u2013 2)^2 = 144, which of the following could be the value of 2x? Answer Choices: (A) \u201326 (B) \u201322 (C) \u201311 (D) 12 (E) -20\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. Given: (x \u2013 2)^2 = 144 We can start by taking the square root of both sides of the equation: \u221a(x \u2013 2)^2 = \u00b1\u221a144 Simplifying the left side of the equation: |x \u2013 2| = \u00b112 Now we can split this into two separate equations: x \u2013 2 = 12 or x \u2013 2 = \u201312 Solving for x in each equation: x = 14 or x = \u201310 Now we can plug each value of x into 2x and see which answer choice(s) match: 2x when x = 14: 2(14) = 28 2x when x = \u201310: 2(\u201310) = \u201320 Therefore, the correct answer choice is (E) \u201320. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
