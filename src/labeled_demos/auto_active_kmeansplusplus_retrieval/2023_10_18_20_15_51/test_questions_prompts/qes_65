  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If the LCM of 9, 7, 2, and q is 504, which of the following could be q? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 6 (D) 9 (E) 5\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the prime factorization of 504: 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7 Next, we need to make sure that q is a factor of 504. Since 504 is divisible by 9, 7, and 2, q must also be a factor of 504. Option A: 7 is already a factor of 504, so it could be q. Option B: 8 is not a factor of 504. Option C: 6 is a factor of 504, but it is not the least common multiple of 9, 7, and 2. Option D: 9 is already a factor of 504, so it could be q. Option E: 5 is not a factor of 504. Therefore, the possible values of q are 7 and 9. Answer: (A) 7 or (D) 9. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: How many positive integers less than 200 are there such that they are multiples of 13 or multiples of 12? Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 29 (C) 30 (D) 31 (E) 32\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We need to find the number of positive integers less than 200 that are either multiples of 13 or multiples of 12. To do this, we can first find the number of multiples of 13 less than 200 and the number of multiples of 12 less than 200. The largest multiple of 13 less than 200 is 13 x 15 = 195. The largest multiple of 12 less than 200 is 12 x 16 = 192. Now, we need to find the number of integers that are multiples of both 12 and 13. To do this, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 13, which is 156. The largest multiple of 156 less than 200 is 156 x 1 = 156. So, we need to count the number of multiples of 13 from 13 to 195 (inclusive), the number of multiples of 12 from 12 to 192 (inclusive), and subtract the number of multiples of 156 from the total. The number of multiples of 13 from 13 to 195 is (195-13)/13 + 1 = 15. The number of multiples of 12 from 12 to 192 is (192-12)/12 + 1 = 16. The number of multiples of 156 from 156 to 156 is 1. Therefore, the total number of positive integers less than 200 that are either multiples of 13 or multiples of 12 is 15 + 16 - 1 = 30. So, the answer is (C) 30. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Adding two non multiples of E always results in a multiple of E; which of the following must be the value of E ? Answer Choices: (A) [A] two (B) [B] three (C) [C] five (D) [D] ten (E) [E] hundred\nA: Let's think step by step. If adding two non-multiples of E always results in a multiple of E, then E must be a common factor of those two numbers. Let's try each option and see if it works: (A) Two: Adding two non-multiples of 2 always results in an even number, which is a multiple of 2. This option could be correct. (B) Three: Adding two non-multiples of 3 does not always result in a multiple of 3. For example, 1 + 5 = 6, which is a multiple of 3, but 1 and 5 are both non-multiples of 3. This option is not correct. (C) Five: Adding two non-multiples of 5 always results in a multiple of 5. This option could be correct. (D) Ten: Adding two non-multiples of 10 always results in a multiple of 10. This option could be correct. (E) Hundred: Adding two non-multiples of 100 always results in a multiple of 100. This option could be correct. Therefore, the correct answer is either (A) two, (C) five, (D) ten, or (E) hundred. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: If y is the smallest positive integer such that 6300 multiplied by y is the square of an integer, then y must be Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 7 (C) 15 (D) 35 (E) 45\nA: Let's think step by step. We need to find the smallest positive integer y such that 6300 multiplied by y is the square of an integer. Let's factor 6300: 6300 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2 * 7 To be a perfect square, each prime factor must have an even exponent. Therefore, we need to add one factor of 7 to make the exponent of 7 even. So, y = 7. Therefore, the answer is (B) 7. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
