  "test_question": "Q: If x<0, y>0, and |x^3| > |y^2|, which of the following must be true? Answer Choices: (A) x > y (B) y^2 > x^2 (C) -x^3 < y^2 (D) \u2013x < y (E) x < \u2013y",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If (x^2 + 1)y=8, which of the following is not a possible value for y? Answer Choices: (A) 8/2 (B) 2/5 (C) 18/3 (D) 3 (E) 17/2\nA: Let's think step by step. We are given the equation (x^2 + 1)y = 8. To find the possible values of y, we need to solve for y. Dividing both sides by (x^2 + 1), we get: y = 8/(x^2 + 1) So, any value of y that makes the denominator (x^2 + 1) equal to zero is not possible, as division by zero is undefined. The denominator (x^2 + 1) is always positive, so it can never be zero. Therefore, all the given answer choices are possible values of y. Hence, the answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: X is an even number and Y is a positive odd number. Which of the following expressions cannot be even? Answer Choices: (A) (XY) ^Y (B) X^3Y^3 (C) X^3 (D) XY (E) Y^2\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that X is even and Y is odd. (A) (XY)^Y: Since Y is odd, (XY)^Y will also be odd because an odd number raised to any power is odd. Therefore, this expression can't be even. (B) X^3Y^3: X is even and Y is odd, so X^3 will be even and Y^3 will be odd. Even * odd = even, so X^3Y^3 will be even. (C) X^3: X is even, so X^3 will also be even. (D) XY: Even * odd = even, so XY will be even. (E) Y^2: Y is odd, so Y^2 will be odd. Therefore, the expression that cannot be even is (A) (XY)^Y. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Which of the following inequalities has a solution set, when graphed on the number line, is a single line segment of finite length? Answer Choices: (A) 2 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (B) 3 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (C) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (D) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 (E) 4 <= 3x+4 <= 6\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to isolate the variable (x) in the inequality. We can do this by subtracting 4 from all parts of the inequality: (A) 2 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes -2 <= 3x <= 2 (B) 3 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes -1 <= 3x <= 2 (C) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes 1 <= 3x <= 2 (D) 5 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes 1 <= 3x <= 2 (E) 4 <= 3x+4 <= 6 becomes 0 <= 3x <= 2 Now we can divide all parts of the inequality by 3: (A) -2/3 <= x <= 2/3 (B) -1/3 <= x <= 2/3 (C) 1/3 <= x <= 2/3 (D) 1/3 <= x <= 2/3 (E) 0 <= x <= 2/3 Option (C) has a solution set that is a single line segment of finite length, from x=1/3 to x=2/3. Therefore, the correct answer is (C). The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: If x < 12, then it must be true that... Answer Choices: (A) -x < -12 (B) -x - 2 < 14 (C) -x + 2 < -10 (D) x + 2 < 10 (E) x - 5 < 16\nA: Let's think step by step. If x < 12, then we can add the same number to both sides of the inequality to get a new inequality. Let's add 5 to both sides: x + 5 < 17 Now we can check which of the answer choices is true for this inequality: (A) -x < -12: This is not true, because if we multiply both sides by -1, we get x > 12, which contradicts the given condition. (B) -x - 2 < 14: This is not true either, because if we add 2 to both sides, we get -x < 16, which is not necessarily true. (C) -x + 2 < -10: This is also not true, because if we subtract 2 from both sides, we get -x < -12, which is not necessarily true. (D) x + 2 < 10: This is true, because if we subtract 2 from both sides, we get x < 8, which is true if x < 12. (E) x - 5 < 16: This is also true, because if we add 5 to both sides, we get x < 21, which is true if x < 12. Therefore, the correct answer is either (D) or (E). The answer is E.\n\n\n"
