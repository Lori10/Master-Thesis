  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Two trains of equal lengths take 10 sec and 15 sec respectively to cross a telegraph post. If the length of each train be 120 m, in what time will they cross other travelling in opposite direction? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 12 (C) 13 (D) 14 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. The total distance covered by both trains when they cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is 240 meters. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds, since they are travelling in opposite directions. Let's call this speed \"v\". We know that the first train takes 10 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/10 = 12 m/s. Similarly, the second train takes 15 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/15 = 8 m/s. Therefore, the relative speed of the two trains is v = 12 + 8 = 20 m/s. To find the time it takes for the two trains to cross each other, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed Plugging in the values we know, we get: time = 240 / 20 = 12 seconds Therefore, the answer is (B) 12. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: The bus that travels from St. Louis to Chicago and back comes to St. Louis every 3 hours while the bus that travels from St. Louis to Springfield and back comes to St. Louis every 7 hours. If at 01:00 o'clock both bused arrived at St. Louis, at what time will they meet in St. Louis again? Answer Choices: (A) 16:00. (B) 18:00. (C) 20:00. (D) 22:00. (E) 24:00.\nA: Let's think step by step. The bus from St. Louis to Chicago arrives every 3 hours, so it will arrive at 04:00, 07:00, 10:00, 13:00, 16:00, 19:00, 22:00, and 01:00 (next day). The bus from St. Louis to Springfield arrives every 7 hours, so it will arrive at 08:00, 15:00, and 22:00. To find the next time they will both arrive at the same time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 7. The multiples of 3 are: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96, 99, 102, 105, 108, 111, 114, 117, 120, 123, 126, 129, 132, 135, 138, 141, 144, 147, 150, 153, 156, 159, 162, 165, 168, 171, 174, 177, 180, 183, 186, 189, 192, 195, 198, 201, 204, 207, 210, 213, 216, 219, 222, 225, 228, 231, 234, 237, 240, 243, 246, 249, 252, 255, 258, 261, 264, 267, 270, 273, 276, 279, 282, 285, 288, 291, 294, 297, 300, 303, 306, 309, 312, 315, 318, 321, 324, 327, 330, 333, 336, 339, 342, 345, 348, 351, 354, 357, 360, 363, 366, 369, 372, 375, 378, 381, 384, 387, 390, 393, 396, 399, 402, 405, 408, 411, 414, 417, 420, 423, 426, 429, 432, 435, 438, 441, 444, 447, 450, 453, 456, 459, 462, 465, 468, 471, 474, 477, 480, 483, 486, 489, 492, 495, 498, 501, 504, 507, 510, 513, 516, 519, 522, 525, 528, 531, 534, 537, 540, 543, 546, 549, 552, 555, 558, 561, 564, 567, 570, 573, 576, 579, 582, 585, 588, 591, 594, 597, 600, 603, 606, 609, 612, 615, 618, 621, 624, 627, 630, 633, 636, 639, 642, 645, 648, 651, 654, 657, 660, 663, 666, 669, 672, 675, 678, 681, 684, 687, 690, 693, 696, 699, 702, 705, 708, 711, 714, 717, 720, 723, 726, 729, 732, 735, 738, 741, 744, 747, 750, 753, 756, 759, 762, 765, 768, 771, 774, 777, 780, 783, 786, 789, 792, 795, 798, 801, 804, 807, 810, 813, 816, 819, 822, 825, 828, 831, 834, 837, 840, 843, 846, 849, 852, 855, 858, 861, 864, 867, 870, 873, 876, 879, 882, The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: What would happen in the previous question if both A and B had started at point P. Answer Choices: (A) 800 Km (B) 600 Km (C) 1000 Km (D) 350 Km (E) 250 Km\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that A travels at a speed of 50 km/h and B travels at a speed of 40 km/h. If they both started at point P, they would be moving in opposite directions. Let's say they meet after x hours. In that time, A would have traveled 50x km and B would have traveled 40x km. We also know that the distance between A and B is 600 km. So, we can set up the equation: 50x + 40x = 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 90x = 600 x = 6.67 hours Now that we know they meet after 6.67 hours, we can find out how far each of them has traveled: A: 50 km/h x 6.67 h = 333.33 km B: 40 km/h x 6.67 h = 266.67 km The total distance they have traveled is: 333.33 km + 266.67 km = 600 km Therefore, the answer is (B) 600 km. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In a watch, the minute hand crosses the hour hand for the third time exactly after every 3 hrs., 18 min., 15 seconds of watch time. What is the time gained or lost by this watch in one day? Answer Choices: (A) 14 min. 10 seconds lost (B) 13 min. 50 seconds lost (C) 13 min. 20 seconds gained (D) 14 min. 40 seconds gained (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time taken by the minute hand to cross the hour hand once. The minute hand moves 12 times as fast as the hour hand (since it covers 12 hours in one rotation while the hour hand covers only 1 hour). So, the relative speed between the two hands is 11 times the speed of the hour hand. Therefore, the time taken by the minute hand to cross the hour hand once is 12/11 hours or 65 5/11 minutes. Now, we are given that the minute hand crosses the hour hand for the third time exactly after every 3 hrs., 18 min., 15 seconds of watch time. So, in one day (24 hours), the minute hand will cross the hour hand for the third time 8 times (since 24 divided by 3 is 8). Therefore, the total time taken by the minute hand to cross the hour hand 8 times is 8 times 65 5/11 minutes, which is equal to 522 2/11 minutes. Now, we need to convert this time into hours and minutes. 522 2/11 minutes is equal to 8 hours, 42 minutes, and 2 2/11 seconds. So, the watch gains 42 minutes and 2 2/11 seconds in one day. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 13 min. 20 seconds gained. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
