  "formatted_prompt": "Q: At what rate percent of simple interest will a sum of money double itself in 22 years? Answer Choices: (A) 6.54 % (B) 4.54 % (C) 8 .2 % (D) 4.94 % (E) 5.54 %\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the formula for simple interest: Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100 Let P be the principal amount and r be the rate of interest. We know that the principal amount will double in 22 years. So, 2P = P + (P * r * 22) / 100 Simplifying this equation, we get: P * r * 22 = P r = 1/22 = 0.0454 Therefore, the rate of interest is 4.54%. The correct answer is (B) 4.54%. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If $10,000 is invested at x percent simple annual interest for n years, which of the following represents the total amount of interest, in dollars, that will be earned by this investment in the n years? Answer Choices: (A) 10,000(x^n)  (B) 10,000(x/100) ^n (C) 10,000n(x/100)  (D) 10,000(1+x/100) ^n (E) 10,000n(1+x/100) \nA: Let's think step by step. The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time In this case, the principal is $10,000, the rate is x percent (which we need to convert to a decimal by dividing by 100), and the time is n years. So, the total amount of interest earned in n years is: Interest = 10,000 * (x/100) * n Simplifying this expression, we get: Interest = 100 * x * n Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 10,000n(x/100). The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Reena took a loan of Rs. 1200 with simple interest for as many years as the rate of interest. If she paid Rs. 588 as interest at the end of the loan period, what was the rate of interest? Answer Choices: (A) 3.6 (B) 7 (C) 18 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve the problem step by step. Let the rate of interest be x% per year. Then, the time period will also be x years. Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100 Given, Principal = Rs. 1200 and Simple Interest = Rs. 588 Therefore, 588 = (1200 * x * x) / 100 Simplifying the above equation, we get: x^2 = 49 Taking the square root on both sides, we get: x = 7 Hence, the rate of interest is 7% per year. Therefore, the correct answer is option (B) 7. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A money lender finds that due to a fall in the annual rate of interest from 8% to 7 3/4 % his yearly income diminishes by Rs. 60.50, his capital is? Answer Choices: (A) 24,200 (B) 28,888 (C) 24,600 (D) 24,628 (E) 24,6012\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the capital be x. Then, 8% of x - 7.75% of x = 60.50 0.25% of x = 60.50 1% of x = 60.50/0.25 x = 24,200 Therefore, the answer is (A) 24,200. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
