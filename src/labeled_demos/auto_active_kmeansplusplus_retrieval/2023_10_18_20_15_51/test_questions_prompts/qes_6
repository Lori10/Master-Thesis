  "test_question": "Q: By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A can do a work in 7 days B in 12 days and C in 5 days. If they work on it together then in how many days required to complete the work? Answer Choices: (A) 420/177 (B) 420/179 (C) 410/87 (D) 90/14 (E) 77/56\nA: Let's think step by step. We can start by finding the individual rates of work for each person. A can do the work in 7 days, so their rate of work is 1/7. B can do the work in 12 days, so their rate of work is 1/12. C can do the work in 5 days, so their rate of work is 1/5. To find the combined rate of work when they work together, we add up their individual rates of work: 1/7 + 1/12 + 1/5 = 60/420 + 35/420 + 84/420 = 179/420 So when they work together, their combined rate of work is 179/420. To find how long it will take them to complete the work, we can use the formula: time = work / rate The work they need to do is 1 (the whole job), and their combined rate of work is 179/420. time = 1 / (179/420) = 420/179 Therefore, the answer is (B) 420/179. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A work which could be finished in 10 days was finished 3 days earlier after 10 more men joined. The number of men employed was? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 20 (C) 88 (D) 71 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the number of men initially employed be x. Then, the work done in 1 day by x men is 1/10 and the work done in 1 day by (x+10) men is 1/(10-3) = 1/7 (since the work was finished 3 days earlier). Now, we can set up an equation based on the work done by x men and (x+10) men: x/10 + (x+10)/7 = 1 Multiplying both sides by 70 (the least common multiple of 10 and 7) gives: 7x + 10(x+10) = 70 Simplifying and solving for x gives: 17x = 60 x = 60/17 Since x is not a whole number, none of the answer choices are correct. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: Pat, kate and mark charged a total of 198 hours to a certain project . If pat charged twice as much time to the project as kate and 1/3 as much times as mark, how many more hours did mark charge to the project than kate. Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 36 (C) 72 (D) 110 (E) 108\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that Kate charged x hours to the project. According to the problem, Pat charged twice as much time as Kate, so Pat charged 2x hours. Also, Pat charged 1/3 as much time as Mark, so Mark charged 3 times as much time as Pat, which is 6x hours. Therefore, the total time charged by all three is x + 2x + 6x = 9x. We know that the total time charged is 198 hours, so: 9x = 198 x = 22 So, Kate charged 22 hours, Pat charged 44 hours, and Mark charged 132 hours. The question asks how many more hours Mark charged than Kate, which is: 132 - 22 = 110 Therefore, the answer is (D) 110. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: A pump can fill a tank with water in 2 hours. Because of a leak, it took 2 hours to fill the tank. The leak can drain all the water of the tank in: Answer Choices: (A) 4 hours (B) 7 hours (C) 8 hours (D) 14 hours (E) 15 hours\nA: Let's think step by step. The pump can fill the tank in 2 hours, so in 1 hour it can fill 1/2 of the tank. Let's assume the leak can drain the entire tank in x hours. In 2 hours, the pump fills the entire tank, but during this time the leak also drains some water. Let's say the leak drains 1/2 of the tank in 2 hours. So, in 2 hours, the pump fills 1/2 of the tank and the leak drains 1/2 of the tank. This means that the net amount of water added to the tank in 2 hours is 0. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 1/2 - 1/x = 0 Solving for x, we get: 1/x = 1/2 x = 2 Therefore, the leak can drain the entire tank in 2 hours. The correct answer is (A) 4 hours. None of the given options match the correct answer. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
