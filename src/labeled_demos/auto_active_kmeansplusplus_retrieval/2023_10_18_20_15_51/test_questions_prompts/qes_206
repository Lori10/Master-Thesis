  "test_question": "Q: On dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, we get the same remainder. The sum of the digits of N is: Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11 (C) 12 (D) 13 (E) 14",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If the number 52,1n9, where n represents the tens digit, is a multiple of 3, then the value of n could be which of the following? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 5 (C) 3 (D) 1 (E) 0\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine if a number is a multiple of 3, we need to add up its digits and see if the sum is a multiple of 3. So, 52,1n9 = 5 + 2 + 1 + n + 9 = 17 + n. For 17 + n to be a multiple of 3, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3. The only answer choice that works is (A) 6, because 17 + 6 = 23, which is a multiple of 3 (since 2 + 3 = 5, which is not a multiple of 3). Therefore, the value of n could be 6. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: what is the smallest number should be added to 5377 so that the sum is completely divisible by 7? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 4 (C) 6 (D) 2 (E) 1\nA: Let's think step by step. To make a number completely divisible by 7, we need to add the smallest number that will make the sum a multiple of 7. We can find this number by taking the remainder of the original number when divided by 7 and subtracting it from 7. So, let's find the remainder of 5377 when divided by 7: 5377 \u00f7 7 = 768 R 1 So, the remainder is 1. To make the sum completely divisible by 7, we need to add: 7 - 1 = 6 Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 6. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In the above number, A and B represent the tens and units digits, respectively. If the above number is divisible by 25, what is the greatest possible value of B x A? Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 15 (C) 20 (D) 25 (E) 35\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that a number is divisible by 25 if and only if its last two digits are divisible by 25. Therefore, we need to find the possible values of AB that are divisible by 25. The units digit B can only be 0, 5, or 10 (since it is a multiple of 5). If B is 0, then AB is also 0 and the product is 0. If B is 5, then AB is either 15 or 25. If B is 10, then AB is either 20 or 30. Out of these options, the greatest possible value of B x A is 25, which occurs when B is 5 and A is 5. Therefore, the answer is (D) 25. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: When positive integer N is divided by positive integer J, the remainder is 18. If N/J = 134.08, what is value of J? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 56 (C) 78 (D) 112 (E) 225\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that N/J = 134.08. We also know that the remainder when N is divided by J is 18. This means that: N = J x 134.08 + 18 We want to find the value of J. We can start by simplifying the expression above: N = 134.08J + 18 We know that N and J are both positive integers, so we can rewrite this as: N = 134J + 8J + 18 Now we can see that 8J + 18 must be a multiple of J, since it is the remainder when N is divided by J. This means that J must be a factor of 8J + 18. We can write: 8J + 18 = J x k where k is some positive integer. Solving for J, we get: J = 18/(k-8) Since J is a positive integer, k-8 must be a factor of 18. The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. We can try each of these values for k and see which ones give us a positive integer value for J. For k=9, we get J = 18/(9-8) = 18, which is a positive integer. This is our answer. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 22. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
