  "test_question": "Q: 8 man work for 6 days to complete a work. How many men are required to complete same work in 1/2 day. Answer Choices: (A) 93 men (B) 94 men (C) 95 men (D) 96 men (E) 97 men",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A work which could be finished in 10 days was finished 3 days earlier after 10 more men joined. The number of men employed was? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 20 (C) 88 (D) 71 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the number of men initially employed be x. Then, the work done in 1 day by x men is 1/10 and the work done in 1 day by (x+10) men is 1/(10-3) = 1/7 (since the work was finished 3 days earlier). Now, we can set up an equation based on the work done by x men and (x+10) men: x/10 + (x+10)/7 = 1 Multiplying both sides by 70 (the least common multiple of 10 and 7) gives: 7x + 10(x+10) = 70 Simplifying and solving for x gives: 17x = 60 x = 60/17 Since x is not a whole number, none of the answer choices are correct. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: A can do a work in 7 days B in 12 days and C in 5 days. If they work on it together then in how many days required to complete the work? Answer Choices: (A) 420/177 (B) 420/179 (C) 410/87 (D) 90/14 (E) 77/56\nA: Let's think step by step. We can start by finding the individual rates of work for each person. A can do the work in 7 days, so their rate of work is 1/7. B can do the work in 12 days, so their rate of work is 1/12. C can do the work in 5 days, so their rate of work is 1/5. To find the combined rate of work when they work together, we add up their individual rates of work: 1/7 + 1/12 + 1/5 = 60/420 + 35/420 + 84/420 = 179/420 So when they work together, their combined rate of work is 179/420. To find how long it will take them to complete the work, we can use the formula: time = work / rate The work they need to do is 1 (the whole job), and their combined rate of work is 179/420. time = 1 / (179/420) = 420/179 Therefore, the answer is (B) 420/179. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A fort had provision of food for 150 men for 60 days. After 10 days, 25 men left the fort. The number of days for which the remaining food will last, is: Answer Choices: (A) 29 1/5 (B) 37 1/4 (C) 42 (D) 54 (E) 60\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total amount of food available in the fort. The provision of food for 150 men for 60 days means that the fort has food for 150 x 60 = 9000 man-days. Step 2: Find the amount of food consumed in the first 10 days. Since there were 150 men in the fort for the first 10 days, the amount of food consumed in the first 10 days is 150 x 10 = 1500 man-days. Step 3: Find the amount of food remaining after 10 days. The amount of food remaining after 10 days is 9000 - 1500 = 7500 man-days. Step 4: Find the number of men remaining in the fort. After 25 men left the fort, the number of men remaining in the fort is 150 - 25 = 125. Step 5: Find the number of days for which the remaining food will last. Let's assume that the remaining food will last for x days. Since the same amount of food is now available for 125 men, the amount of food required for x days is 125x man-days. We know that this amount of food is equal to the remaining food in the fort, which is 7500 man-days. Therefore, we can write the equation: 125x = 7500 Solving for x, we get: x = 60 Therefore, the remaining food will last for 60 days. Answer: (E) 60 The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: The average salary/head of all the workers ina workshop is Rs.850, if the average salary/head of 7technician is Rs.1000 and the average salary/head of the rest is Rs.780, the total no. of workers in the work-shop is ? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 23 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the total number of workers in the workshop be x. We know that the average salary/head of all workers is Rs. 850. So, the total salary of all workers = 850x. We also know that the average salary/head of 7 technicians is Rs. 1000. So, the total salary of these 7 technicians = 1000 x 7 = 7000. Now, we can find the total salary of the remaining workers by subtracting the total salary of the technicians from the total salary of all workers: Total salary of remaining workers = 850x - 7000. We also know that the average salary/head of the remaining workers is Rs. 780. So, we can set up an equation: (850x - 7000) / (x - 7) = 780 Solving for x, we get x = 22. Therefore, the total number of workers in the workshop is 22. The answer is (C) 22. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
