  "test_question": "Q: R, S, T, and U are points on a line, and U is the midpoint of line segment ST. If the lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are 5, 17, and 22, respectively. What is the length of line segment RU? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 7 (C) 8 (D) 9 (E) 10",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 99 (C) 88 (D) 77 (E) 23\nA: Let's think step by step. Let Q's age be x. Then, R's age will be (x + y) and T's age will be (x - y), where y is the age difference between Q and T. Given, (x + y) + (x - y) = 50 2x = 50 x = 25 Therefore, Q's age is 25. Also, R's age is (25 + y). Given, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, (25 + y) - 25 = 25 - (25 - y) y = 12.5 Therefore, R's age is (25 + 12.5) = 37.5 The difference between R and Q's age is (37.5 - 25) = 12.5 Hence, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: If p/7 = r/2 and r = 0.75s, what is the ratio of p to r to s? Answer Choices: (A) 2 : 3 : 4 (B) 8 : 12 : 9 (C) 21 : 6 : 8 (D) 6 : 4 : 3 (E) 12 : 8 : 3\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can simplify the given equation by cross-multiplying: 2p = 7r. Next, we can substitute the given value of r in terms of s: 2p = 7(0.75s) = 21s/4. Solving for p, we get: p = (21s/4) / 2 = 21s/8. So the ratio of p to r to s is: p : r : s = 21s/8 : 0.75s : s = 21 : 6 : 8. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 21 : 6 : 8. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: What Should come in place of the question mark in the following number series ?\nQ. 5 8 10 12 16 (?) Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 18 (C) 17 (D) 21 (E) 23\nA: Let's think step by step. The difference between 5 and 8 is 3, between 8 and 10 is 2, between 10 and 12 is 2, and between 12 and 16 is 4. So, it seems like the differences are not following a specific pattern. To find the missing number, we can try to look for other patterns. One possible pattern is that the numbers are increasing by 1, then 2, then 2, then 4, and so on. Following this pattern, the next number should increase by 4, making it 16 + 4 = 20. However, this number is not among the answer choices. The closest answer choice is (D) 21, which is an increase of 5 from the previous number. This pattern is also possible, as it would be an increase of 1, then 2, then 2, then 5. Therefore, the answer is (D) 21. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: How many 4-digit Q numbers (ABCD) can be formed such that |A \u2013 D| = 2? Answer Choices: (A) 2,000 (B) 1,900 (C) 1,800 (D) 1,600 (E) 1,500\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that |A \u2013 D| = 2. This means that A and D are either 2 digits apart or 2 digits away from each other in the number line. Case 1: A is 2 digits greater than D. In this case, we can choose any digit from 1 to 9 for D (since it's a 4-digit number, we can't have 0 as the first digit). Then, A can be any digit that is 2 greater than D, except for 9 (since we can't have a 5th digit). So, there are 8 choices for A. Case 2: D is 2 digits greater than A. This is the same as Case 1, but with A and D switched. So, there are also 8 choices for A in this case. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit Q numbers that can be formed is 8 + 8 = 16. The answer is (D) 1,600. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
