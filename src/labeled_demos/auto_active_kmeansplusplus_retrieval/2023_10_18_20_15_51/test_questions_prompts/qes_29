  "test_question": "Q: The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3. What is its length now? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 30 (C) 6 (D) 15 (E) 12",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The greatest possible length which can be used to measure exactly the length 8m ,2m 15cm, 8m 90 cm is? Answer Choices: (A) 25cm (B) 101cm (C) 56cm (D) 42cm (E) 5cm\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the given lengths. 8m = 800cm 2m 15cm = 215cm 8m 90cm = 890cm Now, we need to find the GCF of 800, 215, and 890. The prime factorization of 800 is 2^5 x 5^2. The prime factorization of 215 is 5 x 43. The prime factorization of 890 is 2 x 5 x 89. The GCF of these three numbers is 5, since it is the only factor they have in common. Therefore, the greatest possible length that can be used to measure exactly 8m, 2m 15cm, and 8m 90cm is 5cm. The answer is (E) 5cm. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: The area of a square is 4225 sq cm. Find the ratio of the breadth and the length of a rectangle whose length is twice the side of the square and breadth is 24 cm less than the side of the square. Answer Choices: (A) 5:28 (B) 5:19 (C) 5:12 (D) 5:13 (E) 41:130\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the side of the square. We know that the area of the square is 4225 sq cm, so we can find the side by taking the square root of the area: Side of square = \u221a4225 = 65 cm Next, we need to find the length and breadth of the rectangle. We are given that the length is twice the side of the square, so: Length of rectangle = 2 x 65 = 130 cm We are also given that the breadth is 24 cm less than the side of the square, so: Breadth of rectangle = 65 - 24 = 41 cm Now, we need to find the ratio of the breadth and the length of the rectangle. Ratio of breadth to length = 41:130 Simplifying this ratio by dividing both sides by 41, we get: 1:3.17 Multiplying both sides by 5 to get rid of the decimal, we get: 5:15.83 Rounding off to the nearest whole number, we get: 5:16 Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A wire in the form of a circle of radius 3.5 m is bent in the form of a rectangule, whose length and breadth are in the ratio of 6 : 5. What is the area of the rectangle? Answer Choices: (A) 70 cm2 (B) 30 cm2 (C) 66 cm2 (D) 55 cm2 (E) 54 cm2\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length and breadth of the rectangle. Let the length be 6x and the breadth be 5x. The perimeter of the circle is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle. Perimeter of circle = 2\u03c0r = 2\u03c0(3.5) = 7\u03c0 Perimeter of rectangle = 2(6x + 5x) = 22x So, 22x = 7\u03c0 x = 7\u03c0/22 Now, length = 6x = 6(7\u03c0/22) = 21\u03c0/11 Breadth = 5x = 5(7\u03c0/22) = 35\u03c0/22 Area of rectangle = length x breadth = (21\u03c0/11) x (35\u03c0/22) = 735\u03c0^2/242 This is approximately equal to 76.2 m^2. None of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: A rectangular plot measuring 90 metres by 50 metres is to be enclosed by wire fencing. If the poles of the fence are kept 5 metres apart, how many poles will be needed ? Answer Choices: (A) 55 (B) 56 (C) 57 (D) 58 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular plot. Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 2(90 + 50) = 280 meters Next, we need to find the number of poles required if they are kept 5 meters apart. We can divide the perimeter by the distance between two poles: Number of poles = Perimeter / Distance between two poles Number of poles = 280 / 5 = 56 Therefore, the answer is (B) 56. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
