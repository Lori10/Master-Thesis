  "test_question": "Q: A point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan. What is the distance traveled, in centimeters, by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minutes? Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The diameter of the driving wheel of a bus is 120 m. How many revolution, per minute must the wheel make in order to keep a speed of 60 kmph approximately Answer Choices: (A) 245 (B) 257 (C) 262 (D) 265 (E) 275\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed from km/h to m/min. 60 km/h = 60,000 m/h = 1,000 m/min Next, we need to find the circumference of the wheel using the formula: Circumference = \u03c0 \u00d7 diameter Circumference = \u03c0 \u00d7 120 m Circumference \u2248 376.99 m Finally, we can use the formula: Speed = circumference \u00d7 revolutions per minute 1,000 m/min = 376.99 m \u00d7 revolutions per minute Revolutions per minute \u2248 2.65 Therefore, the answer is (D) 265. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If a truck is traveling at a constant rate of 54 kilometers per hour, how many seconds will it take the truck to travel a distance of 600 meters? (1 kilometer = 1000 meters) Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 24 (C) 30 (D) 36 (E) 40\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the truck from kilometers per hour to meters per second since the distance given is in meters. 54 kilometers per hour = 54,000 meters per hour (since 1 kilometer = 1000 meters) = 15 meters per second (since 1 hour = 3600 seconds) Now, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time Plugging in the values we have: 600 meters = 15 meters per second x time Solving for time: time = 600 meters / 15 meters per second time = 40 seconds Therefore, the answer is (E) 40. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: At what time between 7 and 8 o\u2019clock will the hands of a clock be in the same straight line but, not together? Answer Choices: (A) 5 min. past 7 (B) 5 2\u204411 min. past 7 (C) 5 3\u204411 min. past 7 (D) 5 5\u204411 min. past 7 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. The hour hand moves 30 degrees in one hour (360 degrees divided by 12 hours) and 0.5 degrees in one minute (30 degrees divided by 60 minutes). The minute hand moves 6 degrees in one minute (360 degrees divided by 60 minutes). Let's assume that x minutes have passed since 7 o'clock. The angle between the hour and minute hand is given by: |0.5x - 30h|, where h is the hour hand position in degrees. At 7 o'clock, the hour hand is at 210 degrees (7 hours times 30 degrees). Substituting this value, we get: |0.5x - 210| - 6x = 0 Solving for x, we get: 0.5x - 210 = 6x or 0.5x - 210 = -6x Solving for x in both cases, we get: x = 252/11 or x = 210/11 The first solution corresponds to 5 7/11 minutes past 7 and the second solution corresponds to 5 2/11 minutes past 7. Therefore, the answer is (B) 5 2/11 min. past 7. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A man cycles round the boundary of a rectangular park at the rate of 12 kmph and completes one full round in 8 minutes. If the ratio between the length and breadth of the park be 3:2, then its area is: Answer Choices: (A) 1536m2 (B) 15360m2 (C) 153600m2 (D) 163600m2 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular park. Let the length and breadth of the park be 3x and 2x respectively (as given in the ratio 3:2). Perimeter of the park = 2(Length + Breadth) = 2(3x + 2x) = 10x Now, we know that the man cycles round the park at the rate of 12 kmph. In 1 hour, he covers a distance of 12 km. In 1 minute, he covers a distance of 12/60 = 0.2 km = 200 m. In 8 minutes, he covers a distance of 200 x 8 = 1600 m = 1.6 km. We also know that in 8 minutes, he completes one full round of the park. Therefore, 10x = 1.6 km x = 160 m Length of the park = 3x = 480 m Breadth of the park = 2x = 320 m Area of the park = Length x Breadth = 480 x 320 = 153600 m\u00b2 Hence, the correct answer is (C) 153600m\u00b2. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
