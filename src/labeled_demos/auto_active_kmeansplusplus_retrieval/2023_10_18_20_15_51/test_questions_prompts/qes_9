  "test_question": "Q: What is the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 7 (C) 3 (D) 8 (E) 12",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If x^2 \u2013 13x + 40 = q, and x is a positive integer between 1 and 10, inclusive, what is the probability that q < 0? Answer Choices: (A) 1/5 (B) 1/10 (C) 2/5 (D) 3/5 (E) 3/10\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to factor the quadratic equation x^2 \u2013 13x + 40 to find its roots: x^2 \u2013 13x + 40 = (x \u2013 5)(x \u2013 8) Therefore, the equation can be rewritten as: (x \u2013 5)(x \u2013 8) = q To find when q < 0, we need to determine when the product (x \u2013 5)(x \u2013 8) is negative. This occurs when x is between 5 and 8, exclusive, because when x is less than 5 or greater than 8, at least one of the factors is negative, making the product positive. So, out of the 10 possible values of x (1 to 10), there are 2 values (6 and 7) that satisfy the condition q < 0. Therefore, the probability is 2/10 or 1/5. The answer is (A) 1/5. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: If k = 2n - 1, where n is an integer, what is the remainder of k^2/8? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 3 (C) 5 (D) 7 (E) Cannot be determined from the information given.\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can simplify k^2 as (2n-1)^2 = 4n^2 - 4n + 1. Next, we can divide 4n^2 by 8 to get 1/2n^2. Then, we can divide -4n by 8 to get -1/2n. Finally, we can add 1 to get the entire expression as 1/2n^2 - 1/2n + 1. To find the remainder when this expression is divided by 8, we can substitute values of n and see what the remainder is. For example, if n = 1, then k = 1 and k^2/8 = 1/8, which has a remainder of 1 when divided by 8. If n = 2, then k = 3 and k^2/8 = 9/8, which has a remainder of 1 when divided by 8. If n = 3, then k = 5 and k^2/8 = 25/8, which has a remainder of 1 when divided by 8. We can see that no matter what value of n we choose, the remainder is always 1. Therefore, the answer is (A) 1. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Twenty times a positive integer is more than its square by 96, then the positive integer is Answer Choices: (A) 13 (B) 10 (C) 11 (D) 12 (E) 14\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the positive integer to be x. According to the problem, 20x = x^2 + 96 Rearranging the terms, we get x^2 - 20x + 96 = 0 Now, we can solve this quadratic equation using factorization or the quadratic formula. Using factorization, we can write x^2 - 12x - 8x + 96 = 0 x(x - 12) - 8(x - 12) = 0 (x - 8)(x - 12) = 0 Therefore, x = 8 or x = 12. Out of the given answer choices, the correct option is (D) 12. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If the sum of a number and its square is 182, what is the number? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 26 (C) 28 (D) 91 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the number is x. According to the problem, we know that: x + x^2 = 182 Now, we need to solve for x. Let's rearrange the equation: x^2 + x - 182 = 0 We can factor this quadratic equation: (x + 14)(x - 13) = 0 So, the possible values of x are -14 and 13. However, we are looking for a positive number, so the answer is: x = 13 Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 26. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
