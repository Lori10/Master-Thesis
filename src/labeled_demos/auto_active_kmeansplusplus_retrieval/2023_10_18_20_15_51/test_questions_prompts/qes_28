  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Dylan is on a road trip. He planned on arriving at his destination, 2150 miles away, in 6 days. In the first day, he traveled 310 miles. In the next three days, he travels 1140 miles. How many miles, on average, does Dylan need to travel in the next two days to reach his destination? Answer Choices: (A) 330 (B) 340 (C) 350 (D) 360 (E) 370\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many miles Dylan has left to travel after the first four days: 2150 miles - 310 miles (day 1) - 1140 miles (days 2-4) = 700 miles Now we need to find out how many miles Dylan needs to travel on average in the next two days to cover the remaining 700 miles. We can use the formula: average speed = total distance / total time We know the total distance (700 miles) and the total time (2 days), so we can plug those values in: average speed = 700 miles / 2 days = 350 miles per day Therefore, the answer is (C) 350. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A car covers a distance of 624 km in 2 2/5 hours. Find its speed? Answer Choices: (A) 104 kmph (B) 194 kmph (C) 109 kmph (D) 260 kmph (E) 271 kmph\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that speed = distance/time. Here, the distance covered by the car is 624 km and the time taken is 2 2/5 hours. To convert the mixed fraction to an improper fraction, we can multiply the whole number (2) by the denominator (5) and add the numerator (2) to get 12/5. So, time taken = 12/5 hours. Now, we can substitute these values in the formula: Speed = distance/time Speed = 624/(12/5) Speed = 624 * 5/12 Speed = 260 kmph Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 260 kmph. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: One hour after Yolanda started walking from X to Y, a distance of 24 miles, Bob started walking along the same road from Y to X. If Yolanda's walking rate was 3 miles per hour and Bob\u0442's was 4 miles per hour, how many miles had Bob walked when they met? Answer Choices: (A) 24 (B) 23 (C) 22 (D) 21 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it took Yolanda to reach the meeting point. We can use the formula distance = rate x time, where distance is 24 miles and rate is 3 miles per hour. So, time = distance / rate = 24 / 3 = 8 hours. Now, we can use the same formula to find out how far Bob walked in 8 hours at a rate of 4 miles per hour. distance = rate x time = 4 x 8 = 32 miles. However, we need to subtract the distance Yolanda walked in 8 hours to find out the distance Bob walked before they met. Yolanda walked 3 x 8 = 24 miles in 8 hours. So, Bob walked 32 - 24 = 8 miles before they met. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 8. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: James took a 3-hour bike ride. In the second hour he travlled 18 miles, which was 20 percent farther than he traveled the first hour. If he traveled 25 percent farther in the third hour than he did in the second hour, how many miles did jose travel during the entire ride? Answer Choices: (A) 54.0 (B) 54.9 (C) 55.5 (D) 57.0 (E) 63.0\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how far James traveled in the first hour. We know that in the second hour he traveled 20% farther than in the first hour, so we can set up the equation: 18 = 1.2x where x is the distance James traveled in the first hour. Solving for x, we get: x = 15 Next, we need to find out how far James traveled in the third hour. We know that in the third hour he traveled 25% farther than in the second hour, so we can set up the equation: d = 1.25(18) where d is the distance James traveled in the third hour. Solving for d, we get: d = 22.5 Finally, we can add up the distances traveled in each hour to find the total distance traveled: total distance = 15 + 18 + 22.5 = 55.5 Therefore, the answer is (C) 55.5. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
