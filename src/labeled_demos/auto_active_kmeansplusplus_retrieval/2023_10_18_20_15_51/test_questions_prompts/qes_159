  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Mike invested Rs. 3750 in a scheme for 3 years at compound interest rate 6.5% p.a. How much amount will Mike get on maturity of the fixed deposit? Answer Choices: (A) s.4581.29 (B) s.4450 (C) s.4500 (D) s.4500.25 (E) s.4529.81\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the formula for compound interest to solve this problem: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) Where: A = the amount at the end of the investment P = the principal amount (initial investment) r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal) n = the number of times the interest is compounded per year t = the time period of the investment (in years) Plugging in the given values, we get: A = 3750(1 + 0.065/1)^(1*3) A = 3750(1.065)^3 A = 3750(1.207) A = 4522.50 Therefore, the closest answer choice is (E) s.4529.81. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: In order to obtain an income of Rs. 650 from 10% stock at Rs. 96, one must make an investment of Answer Choices: (A) 5363 (B) 6240 (C) 2368 (D) 1987 (E) 2732\nA: Let's think step by step. The annual income from the stock is 10% of the investment. So, we can set up the equation: 10% of the investment = Rs. 650 0.1 x investment = 650 investment = 650 / 0.1 investment = Rs. 6,500 Now, we need to find out how many shares can be bought with an investment of Rs. 6,500 at Rs. 96 per share. Number of shares = investment / share price Number of shares = 6,500 / 96 Number of shares = 67.71 (approx.) Since we cannot buy a fraction of a share, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Number of shares = 68 Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 2732, which is the total investment required to buy 68 shares at Rs. 96 per share. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: If money is invested at r percent interest, compounded annually, the amount of the investment will double in approximately 50/r years. If Luke's parents invested $15,500 in a long term bond that pays 12 percent interest compounded annually, what will be the approximate total amount of the investment 12 years later, when Luke is ready for college? Answer Choices: (A) 62,000 (B) 85,500 (C) 95,500 (D) 100,500 (E) 120,000\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many times the investment will double in 12 years. Using the formula given in the problem, we can calculate that the investment will double approximately every 4.17 years (50/12). Therefore, the investment will double approximately 2.88 times (12/4.17). Next, we need to calculate the final amount of the investment after 12 years. To do this, we can use the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) Where: A = final amount P = principal (initial investment) r = annual interest rate (as a decimal) n = number of times interest is compounded per year t = time (in years) Plugging in the given values, we get: A = 15500(1 + 0.12/1)^(1*12) A = 15500(1.12)^12 A \u2248 55,500 Finally, we need to multiply this amount by the number of times the investment doubled: 55,500 * 2.88 \u2248 159,840 Therefore, the approximate total amount of the investment 12 years later is $159,840. None of the answer choices provided match this result. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Peter has $642,986 in his savings account. What is the least amount of money (in whole number of dollars) that he must add to his account if he wants to split this money evenly among his nine children? Answer Choices: (A) $642,986 (B) $642,987 (C) $642,988 (D) $642,989 (E) $642,990\nA: Let's think step by step. Peter wants to split his savings evenly among his nine children. This means he needs to divide his savings by 9 to find out how much each child will get. $642,986 \u00f7 9 = $71,443.88 However, we need to add a whole number of dollars to his account, so we need to round up to the nearest dollar. $71,443.88 rounded up to the nearest dollar is $71,444. Therefore, Peter needs to add $71,444 to his savings account to split the money evenly among his nine children. The correct answer is (D) $642,989. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
