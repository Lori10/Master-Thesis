  "test_question": "Q: Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A pump can fill a tank with water in 2 hours. Because of a leak, it took 2 hours to fill the tank. The leak can drain all the water of the tank in: Answer Choices: (A) 4 hours (B) 7 hours (C) 8 hours (D) 14 hours (E) 15 hours\nA: Let's think step by step. The pump can fill the tank in 2 hours, so in 1 hour it can fill 1/2 of the tank. Let's assume the leak can drain the entire tank in x hours. In 2 hours, the pump fills the entire tank, but during this time the leak also drains some water. Let's say the leak drains 1/2 of the tank in 2 hours. So, in 2 hours, the pump fills 1/2 of the tank and the leak drains 1/2 of the tank. This means that the net amount of water added to the tank in 2 hours is 0. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 1/2 - 1/x = 0 Solving for x, we get: 1/x = 1/2 x = 2 Therefore, the leak can drain the entire tank in 2 hours. The correct answer is (A) 4 hours. None of the given options match the correct answer. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Five drainage pipes, each draining water from a pool at the same constant rate, together can drain a certain pool in 12 days. How many additional pipes, each draining water at the same constant rate, will be needed to drain the pool in 6 days? Answer Choices: (A)  5 (B)  9 (C)  10 (D)  12 (E)  15\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to understand that the rate of draining water is constant for each pipe. Let's say the rate of each pipe is x. We know that 5 pipes can drain the pool in 12 days. So, the total amount of water in the pool is 5x * 12 = 60x. Now, we want to drain the same pool in half the time, which is 6 days. So, the total amount of water drained should be the same, which is 60x. Let's say we need n additional pipes to drain the pool in 6 days. So, the total number of pipes will be 5 + n. We can use the formula: total amount of water drained = rate * time 60x = (5 + n) * x * 6 Simplifying this equation, we get: 60x = 30x + 6nx 30x = 6nx n = 5 Therefore, we need 5 additional pipes to drain the pool in 6 days. The answer is (A) 5. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: One fill pipe A is 3 times faster than second fill pipe B and takes 10 minutes less time to fill a cistern than B takes. Find when the cistern will be full if fill pipe B is only opened. Answer Choices: (A) 20 min (B) 18 min (C) 15 min (D) 10 min (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the time taken by fill pipe B to fill the cistern is x minutes. According to the problem, fill pipe A is 3 times faster than fill pipe B. Therefore, the time taken by fill pipe A to fill the cistern will be x/3 minutes. Also, it is given that fill pipe A takes 10 minutes less time than fill pipe B to fill the cistern. Therefore, we can write the equation: x - 10 = x/3 Solving this equation, we get: 2x/3 = 10 x = 15 Therefore, fill pipe B takes 15 minutes to fill the cistern. Hence, the answer is (C) 15 min. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A tyre has two punctures. The first puncture alone would have made the tyre flat in 9 minutes and the second alone would have done it in 4 minutes. If air leaks out at a constant rate, how long does it take both the punctures together to make it flat ? Answer Choices: (A) 3 1/5min (B) 2 10/13min (C) 3 3/5min (D) 3 4/5min (E) 3 min\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the tyre has a capacity of 36 units of air (LCM of 4 and 9). The first puncture can make the tyre flat in 9 minutes, which means it can make the tyre lose 4 units of air per minute (36/9). Similarly, the second puncture can make the tyre flat in 4 minutes, which means it can make the tyre lose 9 units of air per minute (36/4). Now, let's assume that both punctures are working together. Let's say the time taken for both punctures to make the tyre flat is 't' minutes. So, in 't' minutes, the first puncture would have made the tyre lose 4t units of air and the second puncture would have made the tyre lose 9t units of air. Since both punctures are working together, the total air lost in 't' minutes would be 4t + 9t = 13t. We know that the tyre has a capacity of 36 units of air. So, 13t = 36 t = 36/13 t = 2 10/13 minutes Therefore, the answer is option (B) 2 10/13 minutes. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
