  "test_question": "Q: Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 81 (C) 90 (D) 99 (E) 110",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: In a class, 30% of the students speaks truth, 20% speaks lie and 10% speaks both. If a student is selected at random, what is the probability that he has speak truth or lie? Answer Choices: (A) 1/4 (B) 2/3 (C) 3/5 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the percentage of students who speak either truth or lie. Percentage of students who speak truth = 30% Percentage of students who speak lie = 20% However, we need to subtract the percentage of students who speak both truth and lie, as they have been counted twice. Percentage of students who speak both truth and lie = 10% Therefore, the percentage of students who speak either truth or lie = 30% + 20% - 10% = 40%. So, the probability that a student selected at random speaks truth or lie is 40%. Answer: None of the above (as none of the answer choices match 40%). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A student must answer 7 out of 10 questions on an examination. If at least 3 of the first 5 questions must be answered, how many possible combinations of 7 questions are available to the student?\n. Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 80 (C) 110 (D) 220 (E) 360\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that the student must answer 7 out of 10 questions, so we need to find the number of ways to choose 7 questions out of 10. This can be calculated using the combination formula: 10C7 = 10! / (7! * 3!) = 120 So there are 120 possible combinations of 7 questions. Step 2: We also know that at least 3 of the first 5 questions must be answered. This means that the student can either answer 3, 4, or 5 questions from the first 5. Step 3: We need to find the number of ways to choose the remaining questions from the remaining 5. This can be calculated using the combination formula: 5C4 + 5C3 + 5C2 = 5! / (4! * 1!) + 5! / (3! * 2!) + 5! / (2! * 3!) = 5 + 10 + 10 = 25 So there are 25 ways to choose the remaining questions. Step 4: We can now find the total number of possible combinations by multiplying the results from step 2 and step 3: (3C3 * 5C4) + (4C3 * 5C3) + (5C3 * 5C2) = (1 * 5) + (4 * 10) + (10 * 10) = 5 + 40 + 100 = 145 Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the correct answer of 145. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In the third grade of Windblown School there are 96 students, one third of them failed the math test and 1/6 failed that literature test. At least how many students failed both tests? Answer Choices: (A) 0. (B) 6. (C) 8. (D) 10. (E) 12.\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of students who failed the math test. One third of the 96 students failed the math test, so: 1/3 x 96 = 32 Therefore, 32 students failed the math test. Step 2: Find the number of students who failed the literature test. 1/6 of the 96 students failed the literature test, so: 1/6 x 96 = 16 Therefore, 16 students failed the literature test. Step 3: Find the number of students who failed both tests. We don't know the exact number of students who failed both tests, but we do know that it must be less than or equal to the smaller of the two numbers we just found (i.e. 16). Therefore, the answer is (B) 6, because that is the only option that is less than or equal to 16. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In a club with 310 peopl, 138 play tennis, 255 play baseball, and 94 people play both sports. How many people do not pla a sport? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 8 (C) 4 (D) 10 (E) 11\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that 138 people play tennis, 255 people play baseball, and 94 people play both sports. To find the number of people who play only tennis, we can subtract the number of people who play both sports from the number of people who play tennis: 138 - 94 = 44 Similarly, to find the number of people who play only baseball, we can subtract the number of people who play both sports from the number of people who play baseball: 255 - 94 = 161 Now, to find the number of people who do not play a sport, we need to subtract the total number of people who play a sport from the total number of people in the club: 310 - (44 + 161 + 94) = 11 Therefore, the answer is (E) 11. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
