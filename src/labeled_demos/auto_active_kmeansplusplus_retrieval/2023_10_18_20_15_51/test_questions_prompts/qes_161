  "formatted_prompt": "Q: 8 people decided to split the restaurant bill evenly. If the bill was $214.18 dollars, how much money did they 1 cent is the smallest unit? Answer Choices: (A) $214.16 (B) $214.17 (C) $214.18 (D) $214.19 (E) $214.24\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to divide the total bill by the number of people to find out how much each person should pay. $214.18 \u00f7 8 = $26.7725 Since we cannot have a fraction of a cent, we need to round up to the nearest cent. $26.77 rounds up to $26.78 Therefore, each person should pay $26.78. The closest answer choice is (B) $214.17, but that is not the correct answer. The correct answer is None of the above. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In a family 4 people eat only vegetarian, 3 people eat only non veg., 2 people eat both veg and non veg.. How many people are in the family? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 3 (C) 10 (D) 2 (E) 9\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that there are 4 people who eat only vegetarian, 3 people who eat only non-veg, and 2 people who eat both veg and non-veg. If we add up the number of people who eat only vegetarian and the number of people who eat both veg and non-veg, we get a total of 6 people. Similarly, if we add up the number of people who eat only non-veg and the number of people who eat both veg and non-veg, we get a total of 5 people. However, we have counted the 2 people who eat both veg and non-veg twice, so we need to subtract them once to get the total number of people in the family. Therefore, the total number of people in the family is 6 + 5 - 2 = 9. So the answer is (E) 9. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A group of 55 adults and 70 children go for trekking. If there is meal for either 70 adults or 90 children and if 28 adults have their meal, find the total number of children that can be catered with the remaining food. Answer Choices: (A) 42 (B) 54 (C) 90 (D) 70 (E) 80\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that there are 55 adults and 70 children, so the total number of people is 55 + 70 = 125. Step 2: We also know that there is enough food for either 70 adults or 90 children. Since there are only 55 adults, we can assume that the remaining food is for the children. Step 3: 28 adults have already had their meal, so the number of adults left is 55 - 28 = 27. Step 4: We need to find out how many children can be catered with the remaining food. Since the remaining food is for either 70 adults or 90 children, we can set up a proportion: 70 adults = 90 children 1 adult = 90/70 children 27 adults = (90/70) x 27 children 27 adults = 34.29 children (rounded to two decimal places) Step 5: Since we can't have a fraction of a child, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the total number of children that can be catered with the remaining food is 35. Answer: None of the above (the closest option is A, but it is not the correct answer). The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: We have 4 people and 1 chairs. In how many ways chairs can be occupy? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 86 (C) 24 (D) 14 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. If we have 4 people and only 1 chair, then only one person can sit on the chair at a time. So, we need to find the number of ways in which we can choose one person out of 4 to sit on the chair. The number of ways to choose one person out of 4 is 4. Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. None of the other options are correct as they are either too high or too low for the given scenario. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
