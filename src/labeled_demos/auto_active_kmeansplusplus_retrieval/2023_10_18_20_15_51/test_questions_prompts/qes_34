  "formatted_prompt": "Q: the distance between parallel sides of the hexagon is 9. determine the length of the hexagon Answer Choices: (A) 18*sqrt3 (B) 18*sqrt2 (C) 18*sqrt4 (D) 19*sqrt3 (E) 17*sqrt3\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that a regular hexagon has six equal sides. Let's call the length of one side \"x\". We also know that the distance between parallel sides (also known as the height) of a regular hexagon is equal to the length of one side multiplied by the square root of 3 divided by 2. So, the height of this hexagon would be: height = x * sqrt(3) / 2 We are given that the height is 9, so we can set up an equation: 9 = x * sqrt(3) / 2 Solving for x, we get: x = 18 / sqrt(3) We can simplify this by multiplying the numerator and denominator by sqrt(3): x = 18 * sqrt(3) / 3 x = 6 * sqrt(3) Therefore, the length of the hexagon is 6 * sqrt(3) multiplied by 6 (since there are six sides), which equals 36 * sqrt(3). The answer choice that matches this is (A) 18*sqrt3. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: A HEXAGON IS FORMED ABCDEF WHICH PERIMETER 36cm. A POLYGON IS FORMED BY JOINING THE POINTS AE &BD . FIND THE AREA OF THE POLYGON ABDE? Answer Choices: (A) 34\u221a3 cm2 (B) 35\u221a3 cm2 (C) 36\u221a3 cm2 (D) 37\u221a3 cm2 (E) 38\u221a3 cm2\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length of each side of the hexagon. Since the perimeter is 36cm and there are six sides, each side has a length of 6cm. Next, we need to find the area of triangle ABE. We can use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is 1/2 * base * height. The base is AB, which has a length of 6cm. To find the height, we need to draw a perpendicular line from E to AB. Let's call the point where the perpendicular line intersects AB point G. Triangle AEG is a 30-60-90 triangle, so the height EG is 3\u221a3 cm. Therefore, the area of triangle ABE is 1/2 * 6cm * 3\u221a3 cm = 9\u221a3 cm2. We can use the same method to find the area of triangle BDE. The base is BD, which also has a length of 6cm. To find the height, we need to draw a perpendicular line from D to BD. Let's call the point where the perpendicular line intersects BD point H. Triangle BDH is also a 30-60-90 triangle, so the height DH is 3\u221a3 cm. Therefore, the area of triangle BDE is 1/2 * 6cm * 3\u221a3 cm = 9\u221a3 cm2. Finally, we can find the area of the polygon ABDE by adding the areas of triangles ABE and BDE. 9\u221a3 cm2 + 9\u221a3 cm2 = 18\u221a3 cm2. Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) since none of the given answer choices match our calculated answer of 18\u221a3 cm2. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: The sides of a rectangular region measured to the nearest centimeter are 8 cm and 5 cm. Out of the following which is the largest possible value of actual area of rectangle ? Answer Choices: (A) 48 (B) 55.25 (C) 52.29 (D) 44 (E) 41.25\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that the actual length and width of the rectangle must be somewhere between 7.5 cm and 8.5 cm for the 8 cm measurement, and between 4.5 cm and 5.5 cm for the 5 cm measurement. To find the largest possible area, we want to use the largest possible length and width within these ranges. The largest possible length is 8.5 cm and the largest possible width is 5.5 cm. So, the largest possible area is 8.5 cm x 5.5 cm = 46.75 cm^2. Out of the given answer choices, the closest one to 46.75 is (D) 44. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 44. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: How many minutes are there in two right angles? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 22 (C) 17 (D) 2888 (E) 2880\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to understand what is meant by \"two right angles.\" A right angle is a 90-degree angle. So, two right angles would be 180 degrees. Next, we need to understand the relationship between degrees and minutes. There are 60 minutes in one degree. Therefore, to find the number of minutes in 180 degrees, we can multiply 180 by 60: 180 x 60 = 10,800 So, the answer is 10,800 minutes. None of the answer choices provided match this answer, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
