  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If x^2 \u2013 13x + 40 = q, and x is a positive integer between 1 and 10, inclusive, what is the probability that q < 0? Answer Choices: (A) 1/5 (B) 1/10 (C) 2/5 (D) 3/5 (E) 3/10\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to factor the quadratic equation x^2 \u2013 13x + 40 to find its roots: x^2 \u2013 13x + 40 = (x \u2013 5)(x \u2013 8) Therefore, the equation can be rewritten as: (x \u2013 5)(x \u2013 8) = q To find when q < 0, we need to determine when the product (x \u2013 5)(x \u2013 8) is negative. This occurs when x is between 5 and 8, exclusive, because when x is less than 5 or greater than 8, at least one of the factors is negative, making the product positive. So, out of the 10 possible values of x (1 to 10), there are 2 values (6 and 7) that satisfy the condition q < 0. Therefore, the probability is 2/10 or 1/5. The answer is (A) 1/5. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: If the sum of a number and its square is 182, what is the number? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 26 (C) 28 (D) 91 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the number is x. According to the problem, we know that: x + x^2 = 182 Now, we need to solve for x. Let's rearrange the equation: x^2 + x - 182 = 0 We can factor this quadratic equation: (x + 14)(x - 13) = 0 So, the possible values of x are -14 and 13. However, we are looking for a positive number, so the answer is: x = 13 Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 26. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If (x \u2013 2)^2 = 144, which of the following could be the value of 2x? Answer Choices: (A) \u201326 (B) \u201322 (C) \u201311 (D) 12 (E) -20\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. Given: (x \u2013 2)^2 = 144 We can start by taking the square root of both sides of the equation: \u221a(x \u2013 2)^2 = \u00b1\u221a144 Simplifying the left side of the equation: |x \u2013 2| = \u00b112 Now we can split this into two separate equations: x \u2013 2 = 12 or x \u2013 2 = \u201312 Solving for x in each equation: x = 14 or x = \u201310 Now we can plug each value of x into 2x and see which answer choice(s) match: 2x when x = 14: 2(14) = 28 2x when x = \u201310: 2(\u201310) = \u201320 Therefore, the correct answer choice is (E) \u201320. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Twenty times a positive integer is more than its square by 96, then the positive integer is Answer Choices: (A) 13 (B) 10 (C) 11 (D) 12 (E) 14\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the positive integer to be x. According to the problem, 20x = x^2 + 96 Rearranging the terms, we get x^2 - 20x + 96 = 0 Now, we can solve this quadratic equation using factorization or the quadratic formula. Using factorization, we can write x^2 - 12x - 8x + 96 = 0 x(x - 12) - 8(x - 12) = 0 (x - 8)(x - 12) = 0 Therefore, x = 8 or x = 12. Out of the given answer choices, the correct option is (D) 12. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
