  "test_question": "Q: Professors borrowed Rs. 5000 from the university at simple interest. After 3 years, the university got Rs. 300 on interest. What was the rate of interest per annum? Answer Choices: (A) 2% (B) 8% (C) 5% (D) 10% (E) None of these",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Reena took a loan of Rs. 1200 with simple interest for as many years as the rate of interest. If she paid Rs. 588 as interest at the end of the loan period, what was the rate of interest? Answer Choices: (A) 3.6 (B) 7 (C) 18 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve the problem step by step. Let the rate of interest be x% per year. Then, the time period will also be x years. Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100 Given, Principal = Rs. 1200 and Simple Interest = Rs. 588 Therefore, 588 = (1200 * x * x) / 100 Simplifying the above equation, we get: x^2 = 49 Taking the square root on both sides, we get: x = 7 Hence, the rate of interest is 7% per year. Therefore, the correct answer is option (B) 7. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: How much time will it take for an amount of Rs. 450 to yield Rs. 81 as interest at 4.5 % per annum of simple interest ? Answer Choices: (A) 3.5 years (B) 4 years (C) 4.5 years (D) 5 years (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that Simple Interest (SI) = (P * R * T) / 100, where P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest and T is the time period. Here, P = Rs. 450, SI = Rs. 81 and R = 4.5% Substituting the values in the formula, we get: 81 = (450 * 4.5 * T) / 100 Simplifying this equation, we get: T = (81 * 100) / (450 * 4.5) T = 4 years Therefore, the answer is (B) 4 years. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: At what rate percent of simple interest will a sum of money double itself in 22 years? Answer Choices: (A) 6.54 % (B) 4.54 % (C) 8 .2 % (D) 4.94 % (E) 5.54 %\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the formula for simple interest: Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100 Let P be the principal amount and r be the rate of interest. We know that the principal amount will double in 22 years. So, 2P = P + (P * r * 22) / 100 Simplifying this equation, we get: P * r * 22 = P r = 1/22 = 0.0454 Therefore, the rate of interest is 4.54%. The correct answer is (B) 4.54%. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A money lender finds that due to a fall in the annual rate of interest from 8% to 7 3/4 % his yearly income diminishes by Rs. 60.50, his capital is? Answer Choices: (A) 24,200 (B) 28,888 (C) 24,600 (D) 24,628 (E) 24,6012\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the capital be x. Then, 8% of x - 7.75% of x = 60.50 0.25% of x = 60.50 1% of x = 60.50/0.25 x = 24,200 Therefore, the answer is (A) 24,200. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
