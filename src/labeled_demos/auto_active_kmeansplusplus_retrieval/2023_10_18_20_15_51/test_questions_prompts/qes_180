  "formatted_prompt": "Q: 12+6=792\n10+2=110\n1+9=9\n2+7=16\n11+4=??\nSolve it? Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 190 (D) 160 (E) 154\nA: Let's think step by step. In the first equation, 12+6=18. In the second equation, 10+2=12. In the third equation, 1+9=10. In the fourth equation, 2+7=9. To solve the fifth equation, we need to find a pattern in the given equations. We can see that the sum of the two numbers in each equation is multiplied by the second number to get the answer. For example, in the first equation, (12+6) x 6 = 108, which is the answer. Using the same pattern, we can solve the fifth equation: (11+4) x 4 = 60. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: If 9210 - 9124 = 210-square, the value represented by the square is Answer Choices: (A) 296 (B) 210 (C) 186 (D) 124 (E) 24\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the difference between 9210 and 9124: 9210 - 9124 = 86 Next, we know that 210 is equal to the square of a number, so we need to find that number. We can do this by taking the square root of 210: sqrt(210) \u2248 14.49 However, we need to find the value represented by the square, not the square root. To do this, we need to square 14.49: 14.49^2 \u2248 210.02 So the value represented by the square is approximately 210.02, which is closest to answer choice (B) 210. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: How many positive integers less than 200 are there such that they are multiples of 13 or multiples of 12? Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 29 (C) 30 (D) 31 (E) 32\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We need to find the number of positive integers less than 200 that are either multiples of 13 or multiples of 12. To do this, we can first find the number of multiples of 13 less than 200 and the number of multiples of 12 less than 200. The largest multiple of 13 less than 200 is 13 x 15 = 195. The largest multiple of 12 less than 200 is 12 x 16 = 192. Now, we need to find the number of integers that are multiples of both 12 and 13. To do this, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 13, which is 156. The largest multiple of 156 less than 200 is 156 x 1 = 156. So, we need to count the number of multiples of 13 from 13 to 195 (inclusive), the number of multiples of 12 from 12 to 192 (inclusive), and subtract the number of multiples of 156 from the total. The number of multiples of 13 from 13 to 195 is (195-13)/13 + 1 = 15. The number of multiples of 12 from 12 to 192 is (192-12)/12 + 1 = 16. The number of multiples of 156 from 156 to 156 is 1. Therefore, the total number of positive integers less than 200 that are either multiples of 13 or multiples of 12 is 15 + 16 - 1 = 30. So, the answer is (C) 30. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: What Should come in place of the question mark in the following number series ?\nQ. 5 8 10 12 16 (?) Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 18 (C) 17 (D) 21 (E) 23\nA: Let's think step by step. The difference between 5 and 8 is 3, between 8 and 10 is 2, between 10 and 12 is 2, and between 12 and 16 is 4. So, it seems like the differences are not following a specific pattern. To find the missing number, we can try to look for other patterns. One possible pattern is that the numbers are increasing by 1, then 2, then 2, then 4, and so on. Following this pattern, the next number should increase by 4, making it 16 + 4 = 20. However, this number is not among the answer choices. The closest answer choice is (D) 21, which is an increase of 5 from the previous number. This pattern is also possible, as it would be an increase of 1, then 2, then 2, then 5. Therefore, the answer is (D) 21. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
