  "test_question": "Q: Ram and Krishna start from A and B, respectively, at the same time and travel towards each other at constant speeds of 20m/s and 40m/s, respectively, along the same route. Ram meets Krishna at point C on the road after 10 seconds. Find the total distance between A to B. Answer Choices: (A) 700 meters (B) 1000 meters (C) 700 kilometers (D) 555 meters (E) 600 meters",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: What would happen in the previous question if both A and B had started at point P. Answer Choices: (A) 800 Km (B) 600 Km (C) 1000 Km (D) 350 Km (E) 250 Km\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that A travels at a speed of 50 km/h and B travels at a speed of 40 km/h. If they both started at point P, they would be moving in opposite directions. Let's say they meet after x hours. In that time, A would have traveled 50x km and B would have traveled 40x km. We also know that the distance between A and B is 600 km. So, we can set up the equation: 50x + 40x = 600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 90x = 600 x = 6.67 hours Now that we know they meet after 6.67 hours, we can find out how far each of them has traveled: A: 50 km/h x 6.67 h = 333.33 km B: 40 km/h x 6.67 h = 266.67 km The total distance they have traveled is: 333.33 km + 266.67 km = 600 km Therefore, the answer is (B) 600 km. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Two trains of equal lengths take 10 sec and 15 sec respectively to cross a telegraph post. If the length of each train be 120 m, in what time will they cross other travelling in opposite direction? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 12 (C) 13 (D) 14 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. The total distance covered by both trains when they cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is 240 meters. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds, since they are travelling in opposite directions. Let's call this speed \"v\". We know that the first train takes 10 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/10 = 12 m/s. Similarly, the second train takes 15 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/15 = 8 m/s. Therefore, the relative speed of the two trains is v = 12 + 8 = 20 m/s. To find the time it takes for the two trains to cross each other, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed Plugging in the values we know, we get: time = 240 / 20 = 12 seconds Therefore, the answer is (B) 12. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If a truck is traveling at a constant rate of 54 kilometers per hour, how many seconds will it take the truck to travel a distance of 600 meters? (1 kilometer = 1000 meters) Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 24 (C) 30 (D) 36 (E) 40\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the truck from kilometers per hour to meters per second since the distance given is in meters. 54 kilometers per hour = 54,000 meters per hour (since 1 kilometer = 1000 meters) = 15 meters per second (since 1 hour = 3600 seconds) Now, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time Plugging in the values we have: 600 meters = 15 meters per second x time Solving for time: time = 600 meters / 15 meters per second time = 40 seconds Therefore, the answer is (E) 40. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A man walking at a rate of 5km/hr crosses a bridge in 15 minutes. The length of the bridge is? Answer Choices: (A) 1250m (B) 1310m (C) 1500m (D) 1000m (E) 1195m\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the man's speed from km/hr to m/min since the answer choices are in meters. 5 km/hr = 5000 m/hr (since 1 km = 1000 m) 5000 m/hr = 83.33 m/min (since 1 hr = 60 min) Next, we need to use the formula: distance = speed x time We know the speed is 83.33 m/min and the time is 15 minutes. Let's plug those values in: distance = 83.33 m/min x 15 min distance = 1250 m Therefore, the length of the bridge is 1250m. The correct answer is (A) 1250m. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
