  "test_question": "Q: The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number. Answer Choices: (A) 368 (B) 377 (C) 288 (D) 997 (E) 112",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: If the number 52,1n9, where n represents the tens digit, is a multiple of 3, then the value of n could be which of the following? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 5 (C) 3 (D) 1 (E) 0\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine if a number is a multiple of 3, we need to add up its digits and see if the sum is a multiple of 3. So, 52,1n9 = 5 + 2 + 1 + n + 9 = 17 + n. For 17 + n to be a multiple of 3, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3. The only answer choice that works is (A) 6, because 17 + 6 = 23, which is a multiple of 3 (since 2 + 3 = 5, which is not a multiple of 3). Therefore, the value of n could be 6. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: Find a 8 digit number that if multiplied by the number 9 or any of its multiplications products (18, 27, 36, 45,..) will result in the multiplication factor repeated (n) number of times. Answer Choices: (A) 12435687 (B) 12345679 (C) 10000000 (D) 99999999 (E) 11111111\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find a number that has 8 digits. Let's start with the number 12345678. Next, we need to check if this number satisfies the given condition. If we multiply it by 9, we get 111111102. This doesn't satisfy the condition because the multiplication factor (1) is not repeated any number of times. Let's try the next number, 12345679. If we multiply it by 9, we get 111111111. This satisfies the condition because the multiplication factor (1) is repeated 8 times. Therefore, the answer is (B) 12345679. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Find the odd man out. 187, 264, 316, 473, 682, 781 Answer Choices: (A) 187 (B) 316 (C) 781 (D) 682 (E) 473\nA: Let's think step by step. The numbers seem random, so we need to find a pattern or rule that applies to all except one of the numbers. If we look at the last digit of each number, we can see that they alternate between odd and even: 7, 4, 6, 3, 2, 1. However, this pattern doesn't apply to 316, which ends in an even digit. Therefore, the odd man out is (B) 316. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: what is the smallest number should be added to 5377 so that the sum is completely divisible by 7? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 4 (C) 6 (D) 2 (E) 1\nA: Let's think step by step. To make a number completely divisible by 7, we need to add the smallest number that will make the sum a multiple of 7. We can find this number by taking the remainder of the original number when divided by 7 and subtracting it from 7. So, let's find the remainder of 5377 when divided by 7: 5377 \u00f7 7 = 768 R 1 So, the remainder is 1. To make the sum completely divisible by 7, we need to add: 7 - 1 = 6 Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 6. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
