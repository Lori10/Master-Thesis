  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Using all the letters of the word \"NOKIA\", how many words can be formed, which begin with N and end with A? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 24 (C) 62 (D) 78 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to choose the first letter as N, which leaves us with four letters: O, K, I, and A. Next, we need to arrange these four letters in different ways to form words. This can be done in 4! = 24 ways. Finally, we need to ensure that each word ends with A. Out of the four remaining letters, only one is A. Therefore, there is only one way to choose the last letter. So, the total number of words that can be formed is 24 x 1 = 24. Therefore, the answer is (B) 24. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: How many 4-digit Q numbers (ABCD) can be formed such that |A \u2013 D| = 2? Answer Choices: (A) 2,000 (B) 1,900 (C) 1,800 (D) 1,600 (E) 1,500\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that |A \u2013 D| = 2. This means that A and D are either 2 digits apart or 2 digits away from each other in the number line. Case 1: A is 2 digits greater than D. In this case, we can choose any digit from 1 to 9 for D (since it's a 4-digit number, we can't have 0 as the first digit). Then, A can be any digit that is 2 greater than D, except for 9 (since we can't have a 5th digit). So, there are 8 choices for A. Case 2: D is 2 digits greater than A. This is the same as Case 1, but with A and D switched. So, there are also 8 choices for A in this case. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit Q numbers that can be formed is 8 + 8 = 16. The answer is (D) 1,600. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Jamboree and GMAT Club Contest Starts\nQUESTION #20:\nHow many words (with or without meaning) can be formed using all the letters of the word \u201cSELFIE\u201d so that the two E\u2019s are not together? Answer Choices: (A)  660 (B)  600 (C)  500 (D)  300 (E)  240\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of ways to arrange all the letters of the word \"SELFIE\". This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken all at a time, which is n!. In this case, n = 6, so the total number of arrangements is 6! = 720. Next, we need to subtract the number of arrangements where the two E's are together. To do this, we can treat the two E's as a single object and find the number of arrangements of the five objects \"S\", \"L\", \"F\", \"I\", and \"EE\". This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is nPr = n!/(n-r)!. In this case, n = 5 and r = 5, so the number of arrangements where the two E's are together is 5! = 120. Finally, we can subtract the number of arrangements where the two E's are together from the total number of arrangements to get the number of arrangements where the two E's are not together: 720 - 120 = 600. Therefore, the answer is (B) 600. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: How many words can be formed by using all the letters of the word \u201cDAUGHTER\u201d so that vowels always come together & vowels are never together? Answer Choices: (A) 5120 (B) 1240 (C) 4320 (D) 6512 (E) 1204\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of arrangements of the letters in the word \"DAUGHTER\". This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is nPr = n!/(n-r)!. Here, we have 8 letters, so n = 8. nPr = 8!/(8-8)! = 8! = 40,320 Next, we need to find the number of arrangements where the vowels always come together. We can treat the group of vowels (AUE) as a single object and find the number of arrangements of the resulting 6 objects (D, G, H, T, R, AUE). This can be done using the same formula as before. nPr = 6!/(6-6)! = 6! = 720 However, we need to multiply this by the number of ways the vowels can be arranged within the group (AUE). This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is nPr = n!/(n-r)!. Here, we have 3 vowels, so n = 3. nPr = 3!/(3-3)! = 3! = 6 So, the total number of arrangements where the vowels always come together is: 720 x 6 = 4,320 Finally, we need to subtract the number of arrangements where the vowels are together from the total number of arrangements to get the number of arrangements where the vowels are never together. 40,320 - 4,320 = 36,000 Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the correct answer of 36,000. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
