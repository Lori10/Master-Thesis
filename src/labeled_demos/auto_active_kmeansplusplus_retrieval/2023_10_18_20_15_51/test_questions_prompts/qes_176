  "test_question": "Q: In a railway station, there are two trains going. One in the harbor line and one in the main line, each having a frequency of 10 minutes. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train? Answer Choices: (A) 0.9 (B) 0.8 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.65 (E) 1.5",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Two trains of equal lengths take 10 sec and 15 sec respectively to cross a telegraph post. If the length of each train be 120 m, in what time will they cross other travelling in opposite direction? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 12 (C) 13 (D) 14 (E) 15\nA: Let's think step by step. The total distance covered by both trains when they cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is 240 meters. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds, since they are travelling in opposite directions. Let's call this speed \"v\". We know that the first train takes 10 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/10 = 12 m/s. Similarly, the second train takes 15 seconds to cover 120 meters, so its speed is 120/15 = 8 m/s. Therefore, the relative speed of the two trains is v = 12 + 8 = 20 m/s. To find the time it takes for the two trains to cross each other, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed Plugging in the values we know, we get: time = 240 / 20 = 12 seconds Therefore, the answer is (B) 12. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In a watch, the minute hand crosses the hour hand for the third time exactly after every 3 hrs., 18 min., 15 seconds of watch time. What is the time gained or lost by this watch in one day? Answer Choices: (A) 14 min. 10 seconds lost (B) 13 min. 50 seconds lost (C) 13 min. 20 seconds gained (D) 14 min. 40 seconds gained (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time taken by the minute hand to cross the hour hand once. The minute hand moves 12 times as fast as the hour hand (since it covers 12 hours in one rotation while the hour hand covers only 1 hour). So, the relative speed between the two hands is 11 times the speed of the hour hand. Therefore, the time taken by the minute hand to cross the hour hand once is 12/11 hours or 65 5/11 minutes. Now, we are given that the minute hand crosses the hour hand for the third time exactly after every 3 hrs., 18 min., 15 seconds of watch time. So, in one day (24 hours), the minute hand will cross the hour hand for the third time 8 times (since 24 divided by 3 is 8). Therefore, the total time taken by the minute hand to cross the hour hand 8 times is 8 times 65 5/11 minutes, which is equal to 522 2/11 minutes. Now, we need to convert this time into hours and minutes. 522 2/11 minutes is equal to 8 hours, 42 minutes, and 2 2/11 seconds. So, the watch gains 42 minutes and 2 2/11 seconds in one day. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 13 min. 20 seconds gained. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A man can hit the target once in five shots. If he fires four shots in succession, what is the probability that he will hit the target? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 1/625 (C) 181/256 (D) 369/625 (E) 185/625\nA: Let's think step by step. The probability of hitting the target in one shot is 1/5. The probability of missing the target in one shot is 4/5. To find the probability of hitting the target in four successive shots, we need to multiply the probability of hitting the target in each shot. So, the probability of hitting the target in four successive shots is (1/5) x (1/5) x (1/5) x (1/5) = 1/625. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 1/625. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: An elevator starts with 5 pasengers and stops at 8 different floors of the house. Find out the probability of all the 5 passengers alighting at different floors. Answer Choices: (A) 90 / 512 (B) 105 / 512 (C) 15/512 (D) 30/512 (E) 48/512\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 8 floors and 5 passengers, so the first passenger has 8 choices of floors to get off at. The second passenger has 7 choices of floors left, the third passenger has 6 choices, the fourth passenger has 5 choices, and the last passenger has 4 choices. Therefore, the total number of ways that the passengers can get off at different floors is: 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 = 6,720 Now, we need to find the total number of ways that the passengers can get off at any floor. This is simply: 8^5 = 32,768 So, the probability of all the passengers getting off at different floors is: 6,720 / 32,768 = 105 / 512 Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 105 / 512. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
