  "test_question": "Q: Last year, a Home Appliance Store sold an average(arithmetic mean) of 42 microwave ovens per month. In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 30 (C) 31 (D) 32 (E) None of the above",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The average of 20 numbers is zero. Of them, at the most, how many may be greater than zero? Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 10 (D) 19 (E) None of the above\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. Let's assume that there are 'n' numbers greater than zero. If the average of 20 numbers is zero, then the sum of all 20 numbers must be zero. Let's say the sum of the 'n' positive numbers is 'x' and the sum of the remaining (20-n) negative numbers is '-x'. So, we can write an equation as: x - (20-n)x/n = 0 Simplifying this equation, we get: n >= 10 Therefore, the maximum number of positive numbers can be 10. Hence, the answer is (C) 10. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The average of 6 observations is 16. A new observation is included and the new average is decreased by 1. The seventh observation is? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 3 (C) 9 (D) 6 (E) 7\nA: Let's think step by step. The average of 6 observations is 16, so the sum of those 6 observations is 6 x 16 = 96. Let the seventh observation be x. When the seventh observation is included, the total number of observations becomes 7, so the new average is (96 + x)/7. We know that the new average is decreased by 1, so we can set up the equation: (96 + x)/7 = 16 - 1 Simplifying this equation, we get: (96 + x)/7 = 15 Multiplying both sides by 7, we get: 96 + x = 105 Subtracting 96 from both sides, we get: x = 9 Therefore, the seventh observation is 9. The answer is (C) 9. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: The average of temperatures at noontime from Monday to Friday is 40; the lowest one is 30, what is the possible maximum range of the temperatures? Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 25 (C) 50 (D) 45 (E) 75\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We know that the average temperature from Monday to Friday is 40. Let's call the sum of the temperatures for those five days \"S\". Then we can write: S/5 = 40 Multiplying both sides by 5, we get: S = 200 We also know that the lowest temperature is 30. Let's call the highest temperature \"H\". Then the range of temperatures is: H - 30 To find the maximum possible range, we need to find the maximum possible value of H. We know that the sum of the temperatures is 200, so: H + 4(40) = 200 Simplifying, we get: H = 40 So the maximum range of temperatures is: 40 - 30 = 10 Therefore, the answer is (A) 20. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: The average age of 8 men is increased by 2 years. When two of them, whose ages are 20 years and 24 years respectively are replaced by two women. What is the average age of these women? Answer Choices: (A) 36 years (B) 30 years (C) 40 years (D) 42 years (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the original average age of the 8 men. Let's call this \"x\". Then, we know that the average age is increased by 2 years, so the new average age is \"x+2\". Next, we replace two men with two women. Let's call the ages of the two women \"a\" and \"b\". We know that the total age of the 8 men is 8x, and the total age of the 2 men we are replacing is 20+24=44. So, the total age of the 6 remaining men is 8x-44. When we add the ages of the two women, the total age becomes (8x-44)+a+b. We want to find the new average age, so we need to divide this total age by the new number of people, which is 8 (since we still have 8 people, just with 2 women instead of 2 men). So, the new average age is [(8x-44)+a+b]/8. We want to simplify this expression and solve for the average age of the two women, so let's start by distributing the division: [(8x-44)+a+b]/8 = (8x-44)/8 + (a+b)/8 We know that the first term on the right side is the new average age of the 6 remaining men, which is x+2. So, we can substitute that in: (x+2) + (a+b)/8 = x+2 Now we can solve for (a+b)/8: (a+b)/8 = 0 This means that the sum of the ages of the two women is 0, which is impossible. Therefore, the answer is (E) None of these. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
