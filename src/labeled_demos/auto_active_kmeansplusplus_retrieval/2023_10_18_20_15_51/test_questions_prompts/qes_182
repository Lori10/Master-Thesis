  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Find a 8 digit number that if multiplied by the number 9 or any of its multiplications products (18, 27, 36, 45,..) will result in the multiplication factor repeated (n) number of times. Answer Choices: (A) 12435687 (B) 12345679 (C) 10000000 (D) 99999999 (E) 11111111\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find a number that has 8 digits. Let's start with the number 12345678. Next, we need to check if this number satisfies the given condition. If we multiply it by 9, we get 111111102. This doesn't satisfy the condition because the multiplication factor (1) is not repeated any number of times. Let's try the next number, 12345679. If we multiply it by 9, we get 111111111. This satisfies the condition because the multiplication factor (1) is repeated 8 times. Therefore, the answer is (B) 12345679. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If the number 52,1n9, where n represents the tens digit, is a multiple of 3, then the value of n could be which of the following? Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 5 (C) 3 (D) 1 (E) 0\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine if a number is a multiple of 3, we need to add up its digits and see if the sum is a multiple of 3. So, 52,1n9 = 5 + 2 + 1 + n + 9 = 17 + n. For 17 + n to be a multiple of 3, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3. The only answer choice that works is (A) 6, because 17 + 6 = 23, which is a multiple of 3 (since 2 + 3 = 5, which is not a multiple of 3). Therefore, the value of n could be 6. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: How many 4-digit Q numbers (ABCD) can be formed such that |A \u2013 D| = 2? Answer Choices: (A) 2,000 (B) 1,900 (C) 1,800 (D) 1,600 (E) 1,500\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that |A \u2013 D| = 2. This means that A and D are either 2 digits apart or 2 digits away from each other in the number line. Case 1: A is 2 digits greater than D. In this case, we can choose any digit from 1 to 9 for D (since it's a 4-digit number, we can't have 0 as the first digit). Then, A can be any digit that is 2 greater than D, except for 9 (since we can't have a 5th digit). So, there are 8 choices for A. Case 2: D is 2 digits greater than A. This is the same as Case 1, but with A and D switched. So, there are also 8 choices for A in this case. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit Q numbers that can be formed is 8 + 8 = 16. The answer is (D) 1,600. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: How many positive integers less than 200 are there such that they are multiples of 13 or multiples of 12? Answer Choices: (A) 28 (B) 29 (C) 30 (D) 31 (E) 32\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We need to find the number of positive integers less than 200 that are either multiples of 13 or multiples of 12. To do this, we can first find the number of multiples of 13 less than 200 and the number of multiples of 12 less than 200. The largest multiple of 13 less than 200 is 13 x 15 = 195. The largest multiple of 12 less than 200 is 12 x 16 = 192. Now, we need to find the number of integers that are multiples of both 12 and 13. To do this, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 13, which is 156. The largest multiple of 156 less than 200 is 156 x 1 = 156. So, we need to count the number of multiples of 13 from 13 to 195 (inclusive), the number of multiples of 12 from 12 to 192 (inclusive), and subtract the number of multiples of 156 from the total. The number of multiples of 13 from 13 to 195 is (195-13)/13 + 1 = 15. The number of multiples of 12 from 12 to 192 is (192-12)/12 + 1 = 16. The number of multiples of 156 from 156 to 156 is 1. Therefore, the total number of positive integers less than 200 that are either multiples of 13 or multiples of 12 is 15 + 16 - 1 = 30. So, the answer is (C) 30. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
