  "test_question": "Q: Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc AC is 160\u00b0, and minor arc BD is 150\u00b0. If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD? Answer Choices: (A) 80\u00b0 (B) 130\u00b0 (C) 140\u00b0 (D) 160\u00b0 (E) 220\u00b0",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Angles AMB and CMD are right angles, \u2220AMD is acute, and \u2220BMC=y\u00b0 is acute. What is \u2220AMD ? Answer Choices: (A) 90\u00b0\u2212y (B) 180\u00b0\u2212y (C) 90\u00b0+y (D) 2y (E) y\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that angles AMB and CMD are right angles, which means they are both equal to 90 degrees. We also know that angle BMC is acute, which means it is less than 90 degrees. Since angles AMB and CMD are both right angles, they add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, angle AMD must be acute since it is less than 180 degrees. Now, let's use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. In triangle AMD, we have angles AMD, AMB, and CMD. AMD + AMB + CMD = 180 Substituting in the values we know: AMD + 90 + 90 = 180 Simplifying: AMD + 180 = 180 AMD = 0 This doesn't make sense since we know that angle AMD is acute. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\n\nQ: How many minutes are there in two right angles? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 22 (C) 17 (D) 2888 (E) 2880\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to understand what is meant by \"two right angles.\" A right angle is a 90-degree angle. So, two right angles would be 180 degrees. Next, we need to understand the relationship between degrees and minutes. There are 60 minutes in one degree. Therefore, to find the number of minutes in 180 degrees, we can multiply 180 by 60: 180 x 60 = 10,800 So, the answer is 10,800 minutes. None of the answer choices provided match this answer, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: At what time between 7 and 8 o\u2019clock will the hands of a clock be in the same straight line but, not together? Answer Choices: (A) 5 min. past 7 (B) 5 2\u204411 min. past 7 (C) 5 3\u204411 min. past 7 (D) 5 5\u204411 min. past 7 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. The hour hand moves 30 degrees in one hour (360 degrees divided by 12 hours) and 0.5 degrees in one minute (30 degrees divided by 60 minutes). The minute hand moves 6 degrees in one minute (360 degrees divided by 60 minutes). Let's assume that x minutes have passed since 7 o'clock. The angle between the hour and minute hand is given by: |0.5x - 30h|, where h is the hour hand position in degrees. At 7 o'clock, the hour hand is at 210 degrees (7 hours times 30 degrees). Substituting this value, we get: |0.5x - 210| - 6x = 0 Solving for x, we get: 0.5x - 210 = 6x or 0.5x - 210 = -6x Solving for x in both cases, we get: x = 252/11 or x = 210/11 The first solution corresponds to 5 7/11 minutes past 7 and the second solution corresponds to 5 2/11 minutes past 7. Therefore, the answer is (B) 5 2/11 min. past 7. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In a game of billiards, A can give B 20 points in 60 and he can give C 30 points in 60. How many points can B give C in a game of 120? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 77 (C) 45 (D) 18 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many points A can give B in a game of 120. We can use the ratio of 20 points in 60 to find out how many points A can give B in 120. 20 points in 60 minutes is equivalent to (20/60) = 1/3 points per minute. Therefore, in 120 minutes, A can give B (1/3 x 120) = 40 points. Now, we need to find out how many points A can give C in a game of 120. Using the same method as above, we get: 30 points in 60 minutes is equivalent to (30/60) = 1/2 points per minute. Therefore, in 120 minutes, A can give C (1/2 x 120) = 60 points. Now, we need to find out how many points B can give C in a game of 120. Let's assume that B can give C x points in 120 minutes. In 120 minutes, A can give B 40 points and A can give C 60 points. Therefore, B can give C (60 - 40) = 20 points in 120 minutes. Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match our calculation. The correct answer is 20. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
