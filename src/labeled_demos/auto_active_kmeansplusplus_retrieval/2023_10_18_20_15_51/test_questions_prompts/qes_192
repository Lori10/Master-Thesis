  "test_question": "Q: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet? Answer Choices: (A) 13x/2 (B) 13x/2 - 6 (C) 13x/24 (D) (13x+1) /24 (E) (13x-12) /24",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A rectangular plot measuring 90 metres by 50 metres is to be enclosed by wire fencing. If the poles of the fence are kept 5 metres apart, how many poles will be needed ? Answer Choices: (A) 55 (B) 56 (C) 57 (D) 58 (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular plot. Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 2(90 + 50) = 280 meters Next, we need to find the number of poles required if they are kept 5 meters apart. We can divide the perimeter by the distance between two poles: Number of poles = Perimeter / Distance between two poles Number of poles = 280 / 5 = 56 Therefore, the answer is (B) 56. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: The length of a rectangular plot is 20 metres more than its breadth. If the cost of fencing the plot @ Rs. 26.50 per metre is Rs. 7420, what is the length of the plot in metres? Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 200 (C) 300 (D) 400 (E) 80\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the breadth of the rectangular plot be x metres. Then, the length of the plot is (x+20) metres. The cost of fencing the plot is Rs. 26.50 per metre. Therefore, the total cost of fencing the rectangular plot is: Perimeter of the plot x Cost per metre = (2 x length + 2 x breadth) x 26.50 Substituting the values of length and breadth, we get: (2(x+20) + 2x) x 26.50 = 7420 Simplifying the equation, we get: 6.5x + 530 = 371 6.5x = 371 - 530 6.5x = -159 x = -24.46 Since the breadth cannot be negative, this answer is not possible. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Two-third of two-fifth of three-fourth of a number is 36. What is the square root of four-fifth of that number? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 12 (C) 14 (D) 16 (E) 18\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to translate the word problem into an equation. Two-third of two-fifth of three-fourth of a number can be written as: (2/3) * (2/5) * (3/4) * x = 36 Simplifying this expression, we get: (1/5) * x = 36 Multiplying both sides by 5, we get: x = 180 Now, we need to find the square root of four-fifth of that number: \u221a((4/5) * 180) Simplifying this expression, we get: \u221a(144) Which is equal to 12. Therefore, the answer is (B) 12. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: the distance between parallel sides of the hexagon is 9. determine the length of the hexagon Answer Choices: (A) 18*sqrt3 (B) 18*sqrt2 (C) 18*sqrt4 (D) 19*sqrt3 (E) 17*sqrt3\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that a regular hexagon has six equal sides. Let's call the length of one side \"x\". We also know that the distance between parallel sides (also known as the height) of a regular hexagon is equal to the length of one side multiplied by the square root of 3 divided by 2. So, the height of this hexagon would be: height = x * sqrt(3) / 2 We are given that the height is 9, so we can set up an equation: 9 = x * sqrt(3) / 2 Solving for x, we get: x = 18 / sqrt(3) We can simplify this by multiplying the numerator and denominator by sqrt(3): x = 18 * sqrt(3) / 3 x = 6 * sqrt(3) Therefore, the length of the hexagon is 6 * sqrt(3) multiplied by 6 (since there are six sides), which equals 36 * sqrt(3). The answer choice that matches this is (A) 18*sqrt3. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
