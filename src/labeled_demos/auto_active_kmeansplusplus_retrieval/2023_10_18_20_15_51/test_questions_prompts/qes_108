  "formatted_prompt": "Q: How many 4-digit Q numbers (ABCD) can be formed such that |A \u2013 D| = 2? Answer Choices: (A) 2,000 (B) 1,900 (C) 1,800 (D) 1,600 (E) 1,500\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that |A \u2013 D| = 2. This means that A and D are either 2 digits apart or 2 digits away from each other in the number line. Case 1: A is 2 digits greater than D. In this case, we can choose any digit from 1 to 9 for D (since it's a 4-digit number, we can't have 0 as the first digit). Then, A can be any digit that is 2 greater than D, except for 9 (since we can't have a 5th digit). So, there are 8 choices for A. Case 2: D is 2 digits greater than A. This is the same as Case 1, but with A and D switched. So, there are also 8 choices for A in this case. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit Q numbers that can be formed is 8 + 8 = 16. The answer is (D) 1,600. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: If m is an integer such that (-2)^2m=2^(18-m) then m=? Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 5 (E) 6\nA: Let's think step by step. We can simplify the left side of the equation first: (-2)^(2m) = 4^m Now we can substitute this into the original equation: 4^m = 2^(18-m) We can rewrite 4 as 2^2: (2^2)^m = 2^(18-m) Using the power of a power property, we can simplify the left side: 2^(2m) = 2^(18-m) Now we have the same base on both sides of the equation, so we can set the exponents equal to each other: 2m = 18 - m Solving for m: 3m = 18 m = 6 Therefore, the answer is (E) 6. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: What Should come in place of the question mark in the following number series ?\nQ. 5 8 10 12 16 (?) Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 18 (C) 17 (D) 21 (E) 23\nA: Let's think step by step. The difference between 5 and 8 is 3, between 8 and 10 is 2, between 10 and 12 is 2, and between 12 and 16 is 4. So, it seems like the differences are not following a specific pattern. To find the missing number, we can try to look for other patterns. One possible pattern is that the numbers are increasing by 1, then 2, then 2, then 4, and so on. Following this pattern, the next number should increase by 4, making it 16 + 4 = 20. However, this number is not among the answer choices. The closest answer choice is (D) 21, which is an increase of 5 from the previous number. This pattern is also possible, as it would be an increase of 1, then 2, then 2, then 5. Therefore, the answer is (D) 21. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: Find the total number of prime factors in the expression (4)^11 x (7)^7 x (11)^2 Answer Choices: (A) 31 (B) 22 (C) 25 (D) 27 (E) 29\nA: Let's think step by step. We can start by finding the prime factorization of each term: - 4 = 2^2 - 7 = 7^1 - 11 = 11^1 Using the properties of exponents, we can rewrite the expression as: (2^2)^11 x 7^7 x 11^2 Simplifying the exponent of 2, we get: 2^(2x11) x 7^7 x 11^2 = 2^22 x 7^7 x 11^2 Now we can see that the expression has 3 prime factors: 2, 7, and 11. And the exponents tell us how many times each prime factor appears: - 2 appears 22 times - 7 appears 7 times - 11 appears 2 times So the total number of prime factors is 22 + 7 + 2 = 31. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 31. The answer is A.\n\n\n"
