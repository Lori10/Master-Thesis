  "formatted_prompt": "Q: We have 4 people and 1 chairs. In how many ways chairs can be occupy? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 86 (C) 24 (D) 14 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. If we have 4 people and only 1 chair, then only one person can sit on the chair at a time. So, we need to find the number of ways in which we can choose one person out of 4 to sit on the chair. The number of ways to choose one person out of 4 is 4. Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. None of the other options are correct as they are either too high or too low for the given scenario. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Four different books (A, B, C and D) are to be arranged on a shelf. Books A and B are to be arranged first and second starting from the right of the shelf. The number of different orders in which books C and D may be arranged is Answer Choices: (A) 16! (B) 12! (C) 8! (D) 11! (E) 2!\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we arrange books A and B in 2! = 2 ways. Then, we have two remaining books, C and D, which can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways. Therefore, the total number of different orders in which the four books can be arranged is 2 x 2 = 4. None of the above answer choices match this result, so the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: In how many ways can 6 apples (identical) be distributed among 5 children? (Some children may get no apples.) Answer Choices: (A) 124 (B) 210 (C) 128 (D) 130 (E) 132\nA: Let's think step by step. We can use the stars and bars method to solve this problem. We need to distribute 6 identical apples among 5 children, which means we need to place 4 dividers (bars) among the 6 apples to separate them into 5 groups. For example, if we place the dividers like this: * | * * | * * * it means the first child gets 1 apple, the second child gets 2 apples, the third child gets 3 apples, the fourth child gets 0 apples, and the fifth child gets 0 apples. The number of ways to place 4 dividers among 6 apples is the same as the number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 10 (6 apples and 4 dividers). This can be calculated as: 10 choose 4 = 10! / (4! * 6!) = 210 Therefore, the answer is (B) 210. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: Eight animals of a circus has to be placed inside in eight cages one in each cage. If 4 of the cage are too small for 6 of the animal then find the number of ways of caging the animal. Answer Choices: (A) A.604 (B) B.2880 (C) C.502450 (D) D.784200 (E) E.302400\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We have 8 animals and 8 cages, so we need to find the number of ways to place each animal in a cage. Step 2: We know that 4 cages are too small for 6 of the animals, so we need to consider these cases separately. Step 3: For the 4 cages that are too small, we need to choose which 6 animals will not fit in each cage. There are 8 choose 6 ways to do this for each of the 4 cages, which is 8C6 * 8C6 * 8C6 * 8C6. Step 4: For the remaining 4 cages, we can place any of the remaining 2 animals in each cage. There are 2 choices for each of the 4 cages, so there are 2^4 ways to place the animals in these cages. Step 5: To find the total number of ways to place the animals in the cages, we need to multiply the number of ways from step 3 and step 4. Therefore, the answer is (8C6)^4 * 2^4 = 302400, which is option (E). The answer is E.\n\n\n"
