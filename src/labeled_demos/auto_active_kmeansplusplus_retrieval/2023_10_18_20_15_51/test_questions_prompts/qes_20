  "test_question": "Q: A bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers it flies by because it can sense they don't have any nectar in them. How many flowers will the bee fly by to bypass 8 flowers? Answer Choices: (A) 2000 (B) 4000 (C) 8000 (D) 16000 (E) 32000",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: When 1/10 percent of 2,000 is subtracted from 1/10 of 2,000, the difference is Answer Choices: (A)  0 (B)  198 (C)  450 (D)  495 (E)  500\nA: Let's think step by step. 1/10 percent of 2,000 is equal to (1/10)*(1/100)*2,000 = 2. 1/10 of 2,000 is equal to 200. So, when we subtract 2 from 200, we get 198. Therefore, the answer is (B) 198. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: How many 4-digit Q numbers (ABCD) can be formed such that |A \u2013 D| = 2? Answer Choices: (A) 2,000 (B) 1,900 (C) 1,800 (D) 1,600 (E) 1,500\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that |A \u2013 D| = 2. This means that A and D are either 2 digits apart or 2 digits away from each other in the number line. Case 1: A is 2 digits greater than D. In this case, we can choose any digit from 1 to 9 for D (since it's a 4-digit number, we can't have 0 as the first digit). Then, A can be any digit that is 2 greater than D, except for 9 (since we can't have a 5th digit). So, there are 8 choices for A. Case 2: D is 2 digits greater than A. This is the same as Case 1, but with A and D switched. So, there are also 8 choices for A in this case. Therefore, the total number of 4-digit Q numbers that can be formed is 8 + 8 = 16. The answer is (D) 1,600. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: An elevator starts with 5 pasengers and stops at 8 different floors of the house. Find out the probability of all the 5 passengers alighting at different floors. Answer Choices: (A) 90 / 512 (B) 105 / 512 (C) 15/512 (D) 30/512 (E) 48/512\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 8 floors and 5 passengers, so the first passenger has 8 choices of floors to get off at. The second passenger has 7 choices of floors left, the third passenger has 6 choices, the fourth passenger has 5 choices, and the last passenger has 4 choices. Therefore, the total number of ways that the passengers can get off at different floors is: 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 = 6,720 Now, we need to find the total number of ways that the passengers can get off at any floor. This is simply: 8^5 = 32,768 So, the probability of all the passengers getting off at different floors is: 6,720 / 32,768 = 105 / 512 Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 105 / 512. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: What Should come in place of the question mark in the following number series ?\nQ. 5 8 10 12 16 (?) Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 18 (C) 17 (D) 21 (E) 23\nA: Let's think step by step. The difference between 5 and 8 is 3, between 8 and 10 is 2, between 10 and 12 is 2, and between 12 and 16 is 4. So, it seems like the differences are not following a specific pattern. To find the missing number, we can try to look for other patterns. One possible pattern is that the numbers are increasing by 1, then 2, then 2, then 4, and so on. Following this pattern, the next number should increase by 4, making it 16 + 4 = 20. However, this number is not among the answer choices. The closest answer choice is (D) 21, which is an increase of 5 from the previous number. This pattern is also possible, as it would be an increase of 1, then 2, then 2, then 5. Therefore, the answer is (D) 21. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
