  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A, B and C rent a pasture. A puts 10 oxen for 7 months, B puts 12 oxen for 5 months and C puts 15 oxen for 3 months for grazing. If the rent of the pasture is Rs. 245, how much must C pay as his share of rent? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 50 (C) 55 (D) 63 (E) none\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of oxen-months contributed by all three people. A contributed 10 oxen for 7 months, so that's 10 x 7 = 70 oxen-months. B contributed 12 oxen for 5 months, so that's 12 x 5 = 60 oxen-months. C contributed 15 oxen for 3 months, so that's 15 x 3 = 45 oxen-months. The total number of oxen-months is 70 + 60 + 45 = 175. Now we need to find out what fraction of the total rent C should pay. C contributed 45 oxen-months out of a total of 175, which is 45/175. To find out how much C should pay, we need to multiply this fraction by the total rent: (45/175) x 245 = 63 So C should pay Rs. 63 as his share of the rent. The correct answer is (D) 63. The answer is D.\n\n\nQ: What are the number of ways to select 3 men and 2 women such that one man and one woman are always selected? Answer Choices: (A) 26 ways (B) 19 ways (C) 30 ways (D) 76 ways (E) 15 ways\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to select one man from the available men, which can be done in C(3,1) ways. Then, we need to select one woman from the available women, which can be done in C(2,1) ways. Next, we need to select the remaining 1 man and 1 woman from the remaining pool of men and women. This can be done in C(2,1) * C(1,1) ways. Therefore, the total number of ways to select 3 men and 2 women such that one man and one woman are always selected is: C(3,1) * C(2,1) * C(2,1) * C(1,1) = 3 * 2 * 2 * 1 = 12 ways None of the answer choices match the correct answer of 12 ways. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: A and B invest in a business in the ratio 3 : 2. If 5% of the total profit goes to charity and A's share is Rs. 855, the total profit is: Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 1425 (B) Rs. 1500 (C) Rs. 1537.50 (D) Rs. 1576 (E) Rs. 1600\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the total profit be x. Since A and B invest in the ratio 3:2, their share of profit will also be in the ratio 3:2. Let A's share be 3y, and B's share be 2y. Now, we know that 5% of the total profit goes to charity. So, the remaining 95% will be divided between A and B in the ratio 3:2. Therefore, A's share will be (3/5) * 95% * x = 57% of x. We are given that A's share is Rs. 855. So, 57% of x = 855. Solving for x, we get x = Rs. 1500. Therefore, the total profit is Rs. 1500. Hence, the correct answer is option (B) Rs. 1500. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: A club with a total membership of 25 has formed 3 committees, M, S and R, which have 8, 12 and 5 members respectively. If no members of committee M is on either of the other 2 committees, what is the greatest possible number of members in the club who are on none of the committees? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 7 (C) 8 (D) 10 (E) 12\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of members who are on the committees. M has 8 members, S has 12 members, and R has 5 members. Since no members of M are on either of the other 2 committees, we can subtract the 8 members of M from the total number of committee members: Total committee members = 8 + 12 + 5 - 8 = 17 So, there are 17 members on the committees. To find the greatest possible number of members who are on none of the committees, we need to subtract this number from the total membership of the club: Greatest possible number of members not on committees = 25 - 17 = 8 Therefore, the answer is (C) 8. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
