  "test_question": "Q: there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school? Answer Choices: (A) 550 (B) 570 (C) 600 (D) 700 (E) none of these",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: A student must answer 7 out of 10 questions on an examination. If at least 3 of the first 5 questions must be answered, how many possible combinations of 7 questions are available to the student?\n. Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 80 (C) 110 (D) 220 (E) 360\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that the student must answer 7 out of 10 questions, so we need to find the number of ways to choose 7 questions out of 10. This can be calculated using the combination formula: 10C7 = 10! / (7! * 3!) = 120 So there are 120 possible combinations of 7 questions. Step 2: We also know that at least 3 of the first 5 questions must be answered. This means that the student can either answer 3, 4, or 5 questions from the first 5. Step 3: We need to find the number of ways to choose the remaining questions from the remaining 5. This can be calculated using the combination formula: 5C4 + 5C3 + 5C2 = 5! / (4! * 1!) + 5! / (3! * 2!) + 5! / (2! * 3!) = 5 + 10 + 10 = 25 So there are 25 ways to choose the remaining questions. Step 4: We can now find the total number of possible combinations by multiplying the results from step 2 and step 3: (3C3 * 5C4) + (4C3 * 5C3) + (5C3 * 5C2) = (1 * 5) + (4 * 10) + (10 * 10) = 5 + 40 + 100 = 145 Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the correct answer of 145. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: In the third grade of Windblown School there are 96 students, one third of them failed the math test and 1/6 failed that literature test. At least how many students failed both tests? Answer Choices: (A) 0. (B) 6. (C) 8. (D) 10. (E) 12.\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the number of students who failed the math test. One third of the 96 students failed the math test, so: 1/3 x 96 = 32 Therefore, 32 students failed the math test. Step 2: Find the number of students who failed the literature test. 1/6 of the 96 students failed the literature test, so: 1/6 x 96 = 16 Therefore, 16 students failed the literature test. Step 3: Find the number of students who failed both tests. We don't know the exact number of students who failed both tests, but we do know that it must be less than or equal to the smaller of the two numbers we just found (i.e. 16). Therefore, the answer is (B) 6, because that is the only option that is less than or equal to 16. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: The average of 20 numbers is zero. Of them, at the most, how many may be greater than zero? Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 10 (D) 19 (E) None of the above\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. Let's assume that there are 'n' numbers greater than zero. If the average of 20 numbers is zero, then the sum of all 20 numbers must be zero. Let's say the sum of the 'n' positive numbers is 'x' and the sum of the remaining (20-n) negative numbers is '-x'. So, we can write an equation as: x - (20-n)x/n = 0 Simplifying this equation, we get: n >= 10 Therefore, the maximum number of positive numbers can be 10. Hence, the answer is (C) 10. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: We have 4 people and 1 chairs. In how many ways chairs can be occupy? Answer Choices: (A) 72 (B) 86 (C) 24 (D) 14 (E) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. If we have 4 people and only 1 chair, then only one person can sit on the chair at a time. So, we need to find the number of ways in which we can choose one person out of 4 to sit on the chair. The number of ways to choose one person out of 4 is 4. Therefore, the answer is (E) 20. None of the other options are correct as they are either too high or too low for the given scenario. The answer is E.\n\n\n"
