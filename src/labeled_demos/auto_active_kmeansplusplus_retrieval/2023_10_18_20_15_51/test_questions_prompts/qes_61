  "test_question": "Q: 30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third. What is the value of 50% of that number? Answer Choices: (A) 22.5 (B) 84 (C) 21 (D) 24 (E) 25",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: Seventy five percent of a number is 21 less than four fifth of that number. What is the number ? Answer Choices: (A) 240 (B) 340 (C) 420 (D) 130 (E) 125\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the number to be 'x'. According to the problem, 75% of the number is 21 less than 4/5 of the number. Translating this into an equation: 0.75x = (4/5)x - 21 Simplifying this equation: 0.75x - (4/5)x = -21 (15/20)x - (16/20)x = -21 (-1/20)x = -21 x = (-21) * (-20) x = 420 Therefore, the answer is (C) 420. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Which of the following values is the greatest Answer Choices: (A) a)  30% of 89 (B) b)  22% of 78 (C) c)  33% of 67 (D) d)  44% of 56 (E) e)  55% of 45\nA: Let's think step by step. A) 30% of 89 = 0.3 x 89 = 26.7 B) 22% of 78 = 0.22 x 78 = 17.16 C) 33% of 67 = 0.33 x 67 = 22.11 D) 44% of 56 = 0.44 x 56 = 24.64 E) 55% of 45 = 0.55 x 45 = 24.75 Therefore, the greatest value is option (E) 55% of 45. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: Two-third of two-fifth of three-fourth of a number is 36. What is the square root of four-fifth of that number? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 12 (C) 14 (D) 16 (E) 18\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to translate the word problem into an equation. Two-third of two-fifth of three-fourth of a number can be written as: (2/3) * (2/5) * (3/4) * x = 36 Simplifying this expression, we get: (1/5) * x = 36 Multiplying both sides by 5, we get: x = 180 Now, we need to find the square root of four-fifth of that number: \u221a((4/5) * 180) Simplifying this expression, we get: \u221a(144) Which is equal to 12. Therefore, the answer is (B) 12. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: If 288 is divided into four parts proportional to 5, 7, 4, 8 then the smallest part is : Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 44 (C) 20 (D) 48 (E) 42\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total proportion: 5 + 7 + 4 + 8 = 24 Next, we need to find the proportion of each part: 5/24, 7/24, 4/24, 8/24 Simplifying these fractions, we get: 5/24, 7/24, 1/6, 1/3 Now, we can find the value of each part by multiplying its proportion by the total value: 5/24 x 288 = 60 7/24 x 288 = 84 1/6 x 288 = 48 1/3 x 288 = 96 Therefore, the smallest part is 48, which corresponds to the proportion of 1/6. The correct answer is (D) 48. The answer is D.\n\n\n"
