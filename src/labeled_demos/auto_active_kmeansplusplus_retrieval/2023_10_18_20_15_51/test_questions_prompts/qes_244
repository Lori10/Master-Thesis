Answer Choices: (A) After 6 minutes (B) After 12 minutes (C) After 18 minutes (D) After 24 minutes (E) none",
  "formatted_prompt": "Q: At 6'o clock clock ticks 6 times. The time between first and\nlast ticks was 30sec. How much time it takes at 12'o clock. Answer Choices: (A) 60sec (B) 62sec (C) 66sec (D) 64sec (E) 76sec\nA: Let's think step by step. At 6'o clock, the clock ticks 6 times, which means that each tick is 1/6th of a full rotation. The time between the first and last ticks is 30 seconds, and there are 5 intervals between the 6 ticks. Therefore, each interval is 30/5 = 6 seconds. At 12'o clock, the clock ticks 12 times, which means that each tick is 1/12th of a full rotation. Using the same logic as before, the time between the first and last ticks at 12'o clock would be 11 intervals of 1/12th of a rotation, which is 11/12ths of a full rotation. So, the time it takes between the first and last ticks at 12'o clock would be (11/12) * 60 seconds = 55 seconds. None of the answer choices match this result, so the answer is None of the above. The answer is A.\n\n\nQ: In a watch, the minute hand crosses the hour hand for the third time exactly after every 3 hrs., 18 min., 15 seconds of watch time. What is the time gained or lost by this watch in one day? Answer Choices: (A) 14 min. 10 seconds lost (B) 13 min. 50 seconds lost (C) 13 min. 20 seconds gained (D) 14 min. 40 seconds gained (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time taken by the minute hand to cross the hour hand once. The minute hand moves 12 times as fast as the hour hand (since it covers 12 hours in one rotation while the hour hand covers only 1 hour). So, the relative speed between the two hands is 11 times the speed of the hour hand. Therefore, the time taken by the minute hand to cross the hour hand once is 12/11 hours or 65 5/11 minutes. Now, we are given that the minute hand crosses the hour hand for the third time exactly after every 3 hrs., 18 min., 15 seconds of watch time. So, in one day (24 hours), the minute hand will cross the hour hand for the third time 8 times (since 24 divided by 3 is 8). Therefore, the total time taken by the minute hand to cross the hour hand 8 times is 8 times 65 5/11 minutes, which is equal to 522 2/11 minutes. Now, we need to convert this time into hours and minutes. 522 2/11 minutes is equal to 8 hours, 42 minutes, and 2 2/11 seconds. So, the watch gains 42 minutes and 2 2/11 seconds in one day. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 13 min. 20 seconds gained. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Three friends-whose walking rates are 1 ft./sec., 3ft./sec.,and 6ft./sec. start together walking in the same direction around a circular track that is 420 feet in circumference.After how many minutes are the three of them together again? Answer Choices: (A) 5 mins (B) 10 mins (C) 15 mins (D) 3 mins (E) 7 mins\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for each friend to complete one full lap around the track. We can use the formula: time = distance / rate For the friend with a walking rate of 1 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 1 ft./sec. = 420 sec. For the friend with a walking rate of 3 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 3 ft./sec. = 140 sec. For the friend with a walking rate of 6 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 6 ft./sec. = 70 sec. Now we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these three times, which will give us the time it takes for all three friends to be together again. The LCM of 420 sec., 140 sec., and 70 sec. is 420 sec. Converting 420 sec. to minutes, we get: 420 sec. / 60 sec./min. = 7 min. Therefore, the answer is (E) 7 mins. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: One fill pipe A is 3 times faster than second fill pipe B and takes 10 minutes less time to fill a cistern than B takes. Find when the cistern will be full if fill pipe B is only opened. Answer Choices: (A) 20 min (B) 18 min (C) 15 min (D) 10 min (E) None of these\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the time taken by fill pipe B to fill the cistern is x minutes. According to the problem, fill pipe A is 3 times faster than fill pipe B. Therefore, the time taken by fill pipe A to fill the cistern will be x/3 minutes. Also, it is given that fill pipe A takes 10 minutes less time than fill pipe B to fill the cistern. Therefore, we can write the equation: x - 10 = x/3 Solving this equation, we get: 2x/3 = 10 x = 15 Therefore, fill pipe B takes 15 minutes to fill the cistern. Hence, the answer is (C) 15 min. The answer is C.\n\n\n"
