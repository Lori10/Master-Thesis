  "formatted_prompt": "Q: The average salary/head of all the workers ina workshop is Rs.850, if the average salary/head of 7technician is Rs.1000 and the average salary/head of the rest is Rs.780, the total no. of workers in the work-shop is ? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 23 (E) 25\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the total number of workers in the workshop be x. We know that the average salary/head of all workers is Rs. 850. So, the total salary of all workers = 850x. We also know that the average salary/head of 7 technicians is Rs. 1000. So, the total salary of these 7 technicians = 1000 x 7 = 7000. Now, we can find the total salary of the remaining workers by subtracting the total salary of the technicians from the total salary of all workers: Total salary of remaining workers = 850x - 7000. We also know that the average salary/head of the remaining workers is Rs. 780. So, we can set up an equation: (850x - 7000) / (x - 7) = 780 Solving for x, we get x = 22. Therefore, the total number of workers in the workshop is 22. The answer is (C) 22. The answer is C.\n\n\nQ: Kiran has 85 currency notes in all, some of which were of Rs. 100 denomination and the\nremaining of Rs. 50 denomination. The total amount of all these currency notes was Rs.\n5000. How much amount did she have in the denomination of Rs. 50?\nA. B. C. None of these D.\nAnswer: Option B\nExplanation: Answer Choices: (A) 1900 (B) 3500 (C) 4000 (D) 2000 (E) 2500\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the number of Rs. 100 notes be x and the number of Rs. 50 notes be y. We know that x + y = 85 (total number of notes) and 100x + 50y = 5000 (total amount). Simplifying the second equation, we get 2x + y = 100. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get x = 25 and y = 60. Therefore, the amount in the denomination of Rs. 50 is 50 * 60 = 3000. So, the correct answer is option B. The answer is B.\n\n\nQ: In order to obtain an income of Rs. 650 from 10% stock at Rs. 96, one must make an investment of Answer Choices: (A) 5363 (B) 6240 (C) 2368 (D) 1987 (E) 2732\nA: Let's think step by step. The annual income from the stock is 10% of the investment. So, we can set up the equation: 10% of the investment = Rs. 650 0.1 x investment = 650 investment = 650 / 0.1 investment = Rs. 6,500 Now, we need to find out how many shares can be bought with an investment of Rs. 6,500 at Rs. 96 per share. Number of shares = investment / share price Number of shares = 6,500 / 96 Number of shares = 67.71 (approx.) Since we cannot buy a fraction of a share, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Number of shares = 68 Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 2732, which is the total investment required to buy 68 shares at Rs. 96 per share. The answer is E.\n\n\nQ: A and B invest in a business in the ratio 3 : 2. If 5% of the total profit goes to charity and A's share is Rs. 855, the total profit is: Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 1425 (B) Rs. 1500 (C) Rs. 1537.50 (D) Rs. 1576 (E) Rs. 1600\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the total profit be x. Since A and B invest in the ratio 3:2, their share of profit will also be in the ratio 3:2. Let A's share be 3y, and B's share be 2y. Now, we know that 5% of the total profit goes to charity. So, the remaining 95% will be divided between A and B in the ratio 3:2. Therefore, A's share will be (3/5) * 95% * x = 57% of x. We are given that A's share is Rs. 855. So, 57% of x = 855. Solving for x, we get x = Rs. 1500. Therefore, the total profit is Rs. 1500. Hence, the correct answer is option (B) Rs. 1500. The answer is B.\n\n\n"
