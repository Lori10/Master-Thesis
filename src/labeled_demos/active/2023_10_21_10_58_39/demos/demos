            "question": "Q: Last year a certain bond price with a face value of 5000 yielded 6% of its face value in interest. If that interest was approx 6.5 of the bond's selling price approx what was the bond's selling price? Answer Choices: (A) 4615 (B) 5325 (C) 5351 (D) 6000 (E) 6154",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much interest the bond yielded. We know that the face value of the bond is $5000 and the interest rate is 6%, so the interest earned is: $5000 x 0.06 = $300 Next, we need to use the information given in the problem to find the selling price of the bond. We know that the interest earned is approximately 6.5% of the selling price, so we can set up an equation: $300 = x x 0.065 where x is the selling price of the bond. Solving for x, we get: x = $4615.38 Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 4615.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. The boy can select one trouser out of nine in 9 ways. For each of these 9 ways, he can select one shirt out of 12 in 12 ways. Therefore, the total number of ways he can select a trouser and a shirt is 9 x 12 = 108 ways. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 108 ways.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total weight of the 6 people in the elevator before the 7th person enters. Total weight of 6 people = 6 x 170 = 1020 lbs Step 2: Find the total weight of all 7 people in the elevator after the 7th person enters. Total weight of 7 people = 7 x 151 = 1057 lbs Step 3: Find the weight of the 7th person by subtracting the total weight of the 6 people from the total weight of all 7 people. Weight of the 7th person = Total weight of 7 people - Total weight of 6 people Weight of the 7th person = 1057 - 1020 Weight of the 7th person = 37 lbs Therefore, the answer is (A) 37.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the train from kmph to m/s. 36 kmph = 36 * 1000 / 3600 m/s = 10 m/s Next, we need to find the total distance the train will cover while crossing the bridge. Total distance = length of train + length of bridge = 100 + 150 = 250 meters Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed time = 250 / 10 = 25 seconds Therefore, the answer is (D) 25 sec.",
