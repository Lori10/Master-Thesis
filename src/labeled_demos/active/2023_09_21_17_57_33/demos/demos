            "question": "Q: A farmer owns a hog that recently gave birth to 6 piglets.  If the farmer raises the piglets until they are fully grown, he can sell the fully grown pig for $300.  Each piglet must grow for at least 12 months before it is large enough to be sold. It costs the farmer $10 per month to feed each animal until it is sold.  If the farmer sells 3 pigs after 12 months, and the remaining 3 pigs after 16 months, how much profit did he earn in total (after deducting the cost of food)?",
