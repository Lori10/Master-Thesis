Thus B is incorrect. You can do a similar approach for C and D (it follows that the sum of a specified odd number of consecutive integers can be odd or even).\nLeaving us with E to be the only not-wrong answer. To confirm, you can easily deduce that the sum of 4 consecutive integers (sum of 2 odd integers) is necessarily even while the sum of 10 consecutive integers (sum of 5 odd integers) is necessarily odd. Thus E is the right answer.",
