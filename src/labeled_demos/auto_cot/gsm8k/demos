            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. In one hour, there are 3 sets of 20 minutes. So, Joy can read 8 x 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 pages in an hour. It will take her 120/24 = <<120/24=5>>5 hours to read 120 pages.",

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. He eats 32 from the largest pizzas because 2 x 16 = <<2*16=32>>32 He eats 16 from the small pizza because 2 x 8 = <<2*8=16>>16 He eats 48 pieces because 32 + 16 = <<32+16=48>>48",

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. In the beginning, Betty has only 100 / 2 = $<<100/2=50>>50. Betty's grandparents gave her 15 * 2 = $<<15*2=30>>30. This means, Betty needs 100 - 50 - 30 - 15 = $<<100-50-30-15=5>>5 more.",

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. Half of the number of Randy's mango trees is 60/2 = <<60/2=30>>30 trees. So Randy has 30 - 5 = <<30-5=25>>25 coconut trees. Therefore, Randy has 60 + 25 = <<60+25=85>>85 treeson his farm.",

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. Lisa earned $60 * 1/2 = $<<60*1/2=30>>30. Tommy earned $30 * 1/2 = $<<30*1/2=15>>15. Lisa earned $30 - $15 = $<<30-15=15>>15 more than Tommy.",
