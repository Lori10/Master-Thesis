            "rationale": "Let's think step by step.\nLisa earned $60 * 1/2 = $<<60*1/2=30>>30.\nTommy earned $30 * 1/2 = $<<30*1/2=15>>15.\nLisa earned $30 - $15 = $<<30-15=15>>15 more than Tommy.",

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step.\nHe eats 32 from the largest pizzas because 2 x 16 = <<2*16=32>>32\nHe eats 16 from the small pizza because 2 x 8 = <<2*8=16>>16\nHe eats 48 pieces because 32 + 16 = <<32+16=48>>48",
