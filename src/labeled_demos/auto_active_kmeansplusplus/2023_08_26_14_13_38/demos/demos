Next, he eats half of the remaining pieces of each color. Finally, he eats red and yellow candies in equal proportions until the total number of remaining candies of all colors equals 20% of the original number. What percent of the red candies remain? Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 7.5% (C) 10% (D) 12.5% (E) 15%",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nLet x be the original number of each color.\nKaz eats all of the green candies and half of the orange ones.\nThere are 0 green candies and 0.5x orange candies remaining.\nHe eats half of the remaining pieces of each color.\nThere are 0.25x orange candies, and 0.5x each of red, yellow, and blue candies.\nHe eats red and yellow candies in equal proportions.\norange+blue+red+yellow = 0.75x + red + yellow = x\nred + yellow = 0.25x\nred = 0.125x, since red = yellow.\nThe answer is D.",

So how many apple and orange he would be able to buy in 100$? Answer Choices: (A) 10 apple an 10 oranges (B) 20 apple and 20 oranges (C) 27 apples and 27 oranges (D) 30 apple and 30 oranges (E) 34 apples and 34 oranges",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nSince cost of an orange is 1$ and apple is 4 times costlier than orange so the cost of apple is 4$. Now if we add cost of an apple and orange it comes to be 5$ and hence if we divide 100 by 5 we get answer 20. So he will be able to buy 20 apple and 20 oranges. So option B is correct.",
