            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nFirst find the number of students who went through breakups: 1/4 * 180 = <<1/4*180=45>>45 students\nThen subtract that number from the total number: 180 students - 45 students = <<180-45=135>>135 students\nThen divide that number by 3 to find the number of students who didn't show up to take the test: 135 students / 3 = <<135/3=45>>45 students\nThen subtract the number of students who failed in each way from the total number to find the number who passed: 180 students - 45 students - 45 students - 20 students = <<180-45-45-20=70>>70 students",

And each time he fires his weapon, his power-fire setting allows him to shoot a flame for 5 seconds.  On average, how many seconds per minute does Jason shoot flames at the dragon hoard?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nSince he fires his weapon on average every 15 seconds, then in one minute he fires the flamethrower 60/15=<<60/15=4>>4 times.\nAnd since each time he fires his weapon, he shoots flame for 5 seconds, then Jason shoots flames at the dragon hoard a total of 4*5=<<4*5=20>>20 seconds of every minute.",
