            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. Rupert is younger than Vincent by 2 years, so he is 22 years old – 2 years = <<22-2=20>>20 years old. Khloe is 10 years younger than Rupert so she is 20 years old – 10 years = 10 years old. Eugene is 3 times older than Khloe so he is 10 years old * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 years old. Yorick is twice Eugene’s age so he is 30 years old * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 years old. Amilia is a quarter of Yorick’s age so she is 60 years old / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 years old. Tricia is a third of Amilia’s age so she is 15 years old / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 years old.",
