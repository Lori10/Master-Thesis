            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nGiven that the tank is 1/3 full of water, and that it requires 16 gallons to fill. 1 full tank -1/3 tank = 2/3 of the tank is empty, which is equal to 16 gallons.\nIf 2/3 of the tank equals 16 gallons, this means 1/3 of the tank is equal to 16 / 2 gallons = 8 gallons\nThe total capacity of the tank or how much the tanks holds = 16 + 8 = <<16+8=24>>24 gallons",

In the third week, 2000 more cases were recorded in the state. What is the total number of recorded new coronaviruses in the state after the three weeks?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nIf there were 5000 new cases on the first week, the total for the second week is 1/2 * 5000 cases = <<5000*1/2=2500>>2500 cases.\nThe total number of new coronavirus cases in the three weeks is 2500 cases + 5000 cases + 2000 cases = <<2500+5000+2000=9500>>9500 cases.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nThe total cost of the entrees is 4 * $20 = $<<4*20=80>>80.\nThe total cost of the dinner is $80 + $10 = $<<80+10=90>>90.\nThe tip is $90 * 0.20 = $<<90*0.20=18>>18\nThe total cost with tip is $90 + $18 = $<<90+18=108>>108",
