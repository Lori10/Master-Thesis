And each time he fires his weapon, his power-fire setting allows him to shoot a flame for 5 seconds.  On average, how many seconds per minute does Jason shoot flames at the dragon hoard?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nSince he fires his weapon on average every 15 seconds, then in one minute he fires the flamethrower 60/15=<<60/15=4>>4 times.\nAnd since each time he fires his weapon, he shoots flame for 5 seconds, then Jason shoots flames at the dragon hoard a total of 4*5=<<4*5=20>>20 seconds of every minute.",

Additionally, he will put a total of 500 silver coins and twice as many bronze coins as silver, all distributed equally across the chests. How many coins in total will be in each chest?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nThere will be 3500 gold coins / 5 chest= <<3500/5=700>>700 gold coins in every chest.\nSo, there will be 500 silver coins / 5 chests = <<500/5=100>>100 silver coins in each chest.\nThen, the number of bronze coins is double the number of silver coins, so there are 2 * 500 = <<2*500=1000>>1000 bronze coins.\nSo there will be 1000 bronze coins / 5 chests = <<1000/5=200>>200 bronze coins in each chest.\nFinally, the total number of coins in every chest will be 700 gold coins + 100 silver coins + 200 bronze coins = <<700+100+200=1000>>1000 coins.",

Jen ran third and finished in 30 seconds.  Tiffany ran the last leg and finished in 7 seconds less than Mary.  How many seconds did it take the team to finish the race?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nSusan's time was 30 seconds + 10 seconds = <<30+10=40>>40 seconds.\nMary's time was 40 seconds * 2 = <<40*2=80>>80 seconds.\nTiffany's time was 80 seconds - 7 seconds = <<80-7=73>>73 seconds.\nThe total time for the team was 80 seconds + 40 seconds + 30 seconds + 73 seconds = <<80+40+30+73=223>>223 seconds.",
