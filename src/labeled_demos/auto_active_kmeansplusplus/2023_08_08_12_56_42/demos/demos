            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nGiven that the tank is 1/3 full of water, and that it requires 16 gallons to fill. 1 full tank -1/3 tank = 2/3 of the tank is empty, which is equal to 16 gallons.\nIf 2/3 of the tank equals 16 gallons, this means 1/3 of the tank is equal to 16 / 2 gallons = 8 gallons\nThe total capacity of the tank or how much the tanks holds = 16 + 8 = <<16+8=24>>24 gallons",

Additionally, he will put a total of 500 silver coins and twice as many bronze coins as silver, all distributed equally across the chests. How many coins in total will be in each chest?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nThere will be 3500 gold coins / 5 chest= <<3500/5=700>>700 gold coins in every chest.\nSo, there will be 500 silver coins / 5 chests = <<500/5=100>>100 silver coins in each chest.\nThen, the number of bronze coins is double the number of silver coins, so there are 2 * 500 = <<2*500=1000>>1000 bronze coins.\nSo there will be 1000 bronze coins / 5 chests = <<1000/5=200>>200 bronze coins in each chest.\nFinally, the total number of coins in every chest will be 700 gold coins + 100 silver coins + 200 bronze coins = <<700+100+200=1000>>1000 coins.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nAna charged her phone halfway, so she took 26 / 2 = <<26/2=13>>13 minutes to charge her phone.\nThus, it took Ana 13 + 53 = <<13+53=66>>66 minutes to charge her phone and tablet.",
