            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nFirst subtract the 7 double-counted animals from Mary's total: 60 animals - 7 animals = <<60-7=53>>53 animals\nThen add the animals she missed to find the real total: 53 animals + 3 pigs = <<53+3=56>>56 animals",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nOn Monday, he spent half of $80 leaving him with $80-(1/2)*$80 = $<<80-(1/2)*80=40>>40\nOn Tuesday, he spent 1/5th of $40 leaving $40-(1/5)*40 = $<<40-(1/5)*40=32>>32\nOn Wednesday, he spent 3/8ths of $32 leaving $32-(3/8)*$32 = $20",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nLarry jogs for a total of 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 days.\nThus, he jogs a total of 8 x 30 = <<8*30=240>>240 minutes.\nThis is equal to 240/60 = <<240/60=4>>4 hours.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nAt his first speed, Kevin ran 10 miles per hour * 0.5 hours = <<10*0.5=5>>5 miles.\nAt his second speed, he ran 20 miles per hour * 0.5 hours = <<20*0.5=10>>10 miles.\n15 minutes is a quarter of an hour so at his third speed, he ran 8 miles per hour * 0.25 hours = <<8*0.25=2>>2 miles.\nTherefore, Kevin ran a total of 5 miles + 10 miles + 2 miles = <<5+10+2=17>>17 miles.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nMary currently has 36 cherry + 48 berry cupcakes = <<36+48=84>>84 cupcakes.\nMary needs an additional 144 cupcakes â€“ 84 = <<144-84=60>>60 cupcakes.\nMary wants to split that number evenly between chocolate and vanilla, so 60 / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 cupcakes of each flavor.",
