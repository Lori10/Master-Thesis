            "question": "Q: Mr. Maximilian has a rental building that he collects rent from every month. The number of units in the building is 100. If the building is 3/4 occupied for a whole year, and each resident of the building pays a rent of $400, calculate the amount of money Mr. Maximilian receives in that year.",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nSince there are 100 units, the number of units occupied by tenants is 3/4 * 100 = <<3/4*100=75>>75\nIf each tenant pays $400 every month, Mr Maximilian receives 75 * $400 = $<<75*400=30000>>30000 in rent revenue every month.\nIn a year, Mr Maximilian receives $30000 * 12 = $<<30000*12=360000>>360000 in rent revenue.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nFirst find the number of students who went through breakups: 1/4 * 180 = <<1/4*180=45>>45 students\nThen subtract that number from the total number: 180 students - 45 students = <<180-45=135>>135 students\nThen divide that number by 3 to find the number of students who didn't show up to take the test: 135 students / 3 = <<135/3=45>>45 students\nThen subtract the number of students who failed in each way from the total number to find the number who passed: 180 students - 45 students - 45 students - 20 students = <<180-45-45-20=70>>70 students",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nMarie will read 20 but gain 6 unread messages a day, so she will lower the number of messages by 20 - 6 = <<20-6=14>>14.\nThus, it will take her 98 / 14 = <<98/14=7>>7 days to read all her unread messages.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nIf 35% represents 14, then 100-35 = 65 represents the amount left of her allowance.\nThe amount she didn't use is 65*14/35 = <<65*14/35=26>>26",
