In the third week, 2000 more cases were recorded in the state. What is the total number of recorded new coronaviruses in the state after the three weeks?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nIf there were 5000 new cases on the first week, the total for the second week is 1/2 * 5000 cases = <<5000*1/2=2500>>2500 cases.\nThe total number of new coronavirus cases in the three weeks is 2500 cases + 5000 cases + 2000 cases = <<2500+5000+2000=9500>>9500 cases.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nFirst find the number of students who went through breakups: 1/4 * 180 = <<1/4*180=45>>45 students\nThen subtract that number from the total number: 180 students - 45 students = <<180-45=135>>135 students\nThen divide that number by 3 to find the number of students who didn't show up to take the test: 135 students / 3 = <<135/3=45>>45 students\nThen subtract the number of students who failed in each way from the total number to find the number who passed: 180 students - 45 students - 45 students - 20 students = <<180-45-45-20=70>>70 students",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nJanet paid with $20 and got back $11, so her muffins cost $20 - $11 = $<<20-11=9>>9.\nEach muffin cost 75 cents, so she bought 9/.75 = <<9/.75=12>>12 muffins",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nTwice the distance Amy biked yesterday is 12*2 = <<12*2=24>>24 miles\nIf Amy biked 3 miles less than twice as far as yesterday, she biked 24-3 = <<24-3=21>>21 miles today.\nThe total distance she biked in the two days is 21+12 = <<21+12=33>>33 miles",
