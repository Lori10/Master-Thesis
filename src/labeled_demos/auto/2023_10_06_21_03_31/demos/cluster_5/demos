            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nSam has 8 marbles left after giving 3 marbles/person x 2 people = 6 marbles to Sally and Steve.\nHence, Sam had 8 marbles + 6 marbles = <<8+6=14>>14 marbles in the beginning.\nSam had twice as many marbles as Steve, therefore Steve has 14 marbles / 2 = <<14/2=7>>7 marbles in the beginning.\nSo now, Steve has a total of 7 marbles + 3 marbles = <<7+3=10>>10 marbles after Sam gave him 3 marbles.",

From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?",
