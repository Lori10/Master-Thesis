            "question": "Q: Kevin has been for a run and wants to calculate how far he traveled. He ran at 10 miles per hour for half an hour, 20 miles per hour for half an hour, then ran at 8 miles per hour for 15 minutes. How many miles has Kevin run?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nAt his first speed, Kevin ran 10 miles per hour * 0.5 hours = <<10*0.5=5>>5 miles.\nAt his second speed, he ran 20 miles per hour * 0.5 hours = <<20*0.5=10>>10 miles.\n15 minutes is a quarter of an hour so at his third speed, he ran 8 miles per hour * 0.25 hours = <<8*0.25=2>>2 miles.\nTherefore, Kevin ran a total of 5 miles + 10 miles + 2 miles = <<5+10+2=17>>17 miles.",

            "question": "Q: Every Monday to Friday morning, Alice walks 10 miles through a large grass field to get to school. To avoid the hot afternoon sun on her way home, she walks 12 miles through a forest. When she gets home on Friday, how many miles will she have walked that week?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nOn Monday the total number of miles Alice walks to and from school is 10 + 12 = <<10+12=22>>22 miles.\nFor the other 4 days, from Tuesday to Friday, she walks an additional 4 * 22 = <<4*22=88>>88 miles\nThe total number of miles she will have walked by Friday 22 + 88 = <<22+88=110>>110 miles",

            "question": "Q: Mr. Isaac rides his bicycle at the rate of 10 miles per hour for 30 minutes. If he rides for another 15 miles, rests for 30 minutes, and then covers the remaining distance of 20 miles, what's the total time in minutes took to travel the whole journey?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nIf in one hour he covers 10 miles and rides for 15 miles at the rate of 10 miles per hour, then the time taken for the 15 miles will be 15/10 = <<15/10=1.5>>1.5 hours.\nThe time in minutes is 1.5 * 60 = <<1.5*60=90>>90 minutes.\nThe time taken for the remaining 20 miles at a rate of 10 miles per hour is 20/10= <<20/10=2>>2 hours.\nThe time in minutes is 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.\nThe total time taken for the whole journey is the first 30 minutes + 90 + 30 minutes for resting +120 minutes = <<30+90+30+120=270>>270 minutes.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\n35 miles into 5 equal portions will be 35/5 = <<35/5=7>>7 miles each\nAbel traveled at a speed of 40 miles per hour for 0.7 hours so he will cover 40*0.7 = <<40*0.7=28>>28 miles\n7 miles make a portion so 28 miles is equivalent to 28/7 = <<28/7=4>>4 portions",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nThe car drives 180 miles in 4 hours, so its average speed is 180 miles / 4 hours = <<180/4=45>>45 miles per hour.\nIn the next 3 hours, the car will drive 45 miles/hour * 3 hours = <<45*3=135>>135 miles.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nOn the second day, Mr. and Mrs. Hugo traveled 200 x 3/4 = <<200*3/4=150>>150 miles.\nThey traveled a total of 200 + 150 = <<200+150=350>>350 miles in the first two days.\nOn the third day, they traveled 350 x 1/2 = <<350*1/2=175>>175 miles.\nSo, Mr. and Mrs. Hugo traveled a total of 200 + 150 + 175 = <<200+150+175=525>>525 miles for 3 days.",
