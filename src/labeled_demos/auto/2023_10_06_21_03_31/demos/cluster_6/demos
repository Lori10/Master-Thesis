            "question": "Q: Mary wants 144 cupcakes for her party. Mary has already made 36 cherry cupcakes, and 48 berry cupcakes. Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes for the rest. How much of each should she make?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nMary currently has 36 cherry + 48 berry cupcakes = <<36+48=84>>84 cupcakes.\nMary needs an additional 144 cupcakes – 84 = <<144-84=60>>60 cupcakes.\nMary wants to split that number evenly between chocolate and vanilla, so 60 / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 cupcakes of each flavor.",

            "question": "Q: There are four members in one household. Each member consumes 3 slices of bread during breakfast and 2 slices of bread for snacks. A loaf of bread has 12 slices. How many days will five loaves of bread last in this family?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nA total of 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 slices of bread are consumed by each member every day.\nSo a family consumes a total of 5 x 4 = <<5*4=20>>20 slices of bread every day.\nFive loaves of bread have 5 x 12 = <<5*12=60>>60 slices of bread.\nThus, the 5 loaves of bread last for 60/20 = <<60/20=3>>3 days.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nMichelle kept 4 sandwiches * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 sandwiches for herself.\nThis leaves 20 total sandwiches – 4 sandwiches for a coworker – 8 sandwiches for herself = <<20-4-8=8>>8 sandwiches for her other co-workers.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nMonica's mother ate half as many cookies as Monica's father, so she ate 10 cookies / 2 = <<10/2=5>>5 cookies.\nMonica's brother ate 5 cookies + 2 cookies = <<5+2=7>>7 cookies.\nThere were 30 cookies - 7 cookies - 5 cookies - 10 cookies = <<30-7-5-10=8>>8 cookies left for Monica.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nTwo dozens of doughnuts are equal to 2 x 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 doughnuts.\nSince 8 doughnuts were eaten, therefore 24 - 8 = <<24-8=16>>16 doughnuts are left.",

Shane will make as many sandwiches as he can according to the ham he has. How many slices of bread will he have leftover?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nWith 2 packages of sliced ham, Shane has 2 * 8 = <<2*8=16>>16 slices of ham.\nSince he has 16 slices, Shane makes 16 sandwiches.\nWith 2 packages of sliced bread, he has 20 * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 slices of bread.\nTo make the 16 sandwiches, he needs 16 * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 slices of bread.\nHe has 40 - 32 = <<40-32=8>>8 slices of bread leftover.",
