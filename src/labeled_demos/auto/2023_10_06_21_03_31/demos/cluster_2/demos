            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nHe has 16 hours because 2 x 8 = <<2*8=16>>16\nHe is going to spend 25% of his time reading because 100 - 75 = <<100-75=25>>25\nHe has 4 hours to read because 16 x .25 = <<16*.25=4>>4\nHe will read 240 pages because 4 x 60 = <<4*60=240>>240\nHe will read 3 books because 240 / 80 = <<240/80=3>>3",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nOn Monday, Joanna reads 3*16=<<3*16=48>>48 pages.\nOn Tuesday, Joanna reads 6.5 * 16 =<<6.5*16=104>>104 pages.\nSo far, she has read 48 +104 =<<48+104=152>>152 pages.\nThus, she has 248-152 = <<248-152=96>>96 pages left.\nShe will need to read for 96/16 = <<96/16=6>>6 hours to finish the book.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nLarry jogs for a total of 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 days.\nThus, he jogs a total of 8 x 30 = <<8*30=240>>240 minutes.\nThis is equal to 240/60 = <<240/60=4>>4 hours.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nFirst, we need to determine how many hours Jill studied in total. To find this out, we begin by performing 2*2= <<2*2=4>>4 hours spent on day two, double what she spent on day 1.\nNext, we perform 4-1= <<4-1=3>>3 hours to determine the amount she studied on the third day.\nWe then add 2+4+3= <<2+4+3=9>>9 hours spent in total across 3 days.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, she studied 9*60=<<9*60=540>>540 minutes in total.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nSince Peter reads three times as fast as Kristin, Kristin will take 18*3 = <<18*3=54>>54 hours to read one book.\nKristin reads half of her books, a total of 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 books.\nThe time Kristin will take to read half of her books is 10*54 = <<10*54=540>>540",
