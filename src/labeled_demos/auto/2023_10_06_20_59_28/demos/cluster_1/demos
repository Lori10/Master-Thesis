            "question": "Q: A and B start a business, with A investing the total capital of Rs.50000, on the condition that B pays A interest @ 10% per annum on his half of the capital. A is a working partner and receives Rs.1500 per month from the total profit and any profit remaining is equally shared by both of them. At the end of the year, it was found that the income of A is twice that of B. Find the total profit for the year? Answer Choices: (A) 59028 (B) 59010 (C) 59190 (D) 59000 (E) 92700",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nInterest received by A from B = 10% of half of Rs.50000 = 10% * 25000 = 2500.\nAmount received by A per annum for being a working partner = 1500 * 12 = Rs.18000.\nLet 'P' be the part of the remaining profit that A receives as his share. Total income of A = (2500 + 18000 + P)\nTotal income of B = only his share from the remaining profit = 'P', as A and B share the remaining profit equally.\nIncome of A = Twice the income of B\n(2500 + 18000 + P) = 2(P)\nP = 20500\nTotal profit = 2P + 18000\n= 2*20500 + 18000 = 59000\nAnswer:D",
