            "question": "Q: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nFirst subtract the 7 double-counted animals from Mary's total: 60 animals - 7 animals = <<60-7=53>>53 animals\nThen add the animals she missed to find the real total: 53 animals + 3 pigs = <<53+3=56>>56 animals",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nOn Monday, he spent half of $80 leaving him with $80-(1/2)*$80 = $<<80-(1/2)*80=40>>40\nOn Tuesday, he spent 1/5th of $40 leaving $40-(1/5)*40 = $<<40-(1/5)*40=32>>32\nOn Wednesday, he spent 3/8ths of $32 leaving $32-(3/8)*$32 = $20",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nHe has 16 hours because 2 x 8 = <<2*8=16>>16\nHe is going to spend 25% of his time reading because 100 - 75 = <<100-75=25>>25\nHe has 4 hours to read because 16 x .25 = <<16*.25=4>>4\nHe will read 240 pages because 4 x 60 = <<4*60=240>>240\nHe will read 3 books because 240 / 80 = <<240/80=3>>3",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nAt his first speed, Kevin ran 10 miles per hour * 0.5 hours = <<10*0.5=5>>5 miles.\nAt his second speed, he ran 20 miles per hour * 0.5 hours = <<20*0.5=10>>10 miles.\n15 minutes is a quarter of an hour so at his third speed, he ran 8 miles per hour * 0.25 hours = <<8*0.25=2>>2 miles.\nTherefore, Kevin ran a total of 5 miles + 10 miles + 2 miles = <<5+10+2=17>>17 miles.",
