            "question": "Q: Oliver had $9, then he saved $5 from his allowance and spent $4 on a frisbee and $3 on a puzzle. His friend gives him another $8 as it's his birthday. How much money does Oliver have left?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nThe total amount of money saved is $9 + $5 = $<<9+5=14>>14.\nThe total cost of the frisbee and the puzzle is $4 + $3 = $<<4+3=7>>7.\nSo Oliver has $14 - $7 = $<<14-7=7>>7 left.\nHis friend gives him $8, so now he has $7 + $8 = $<<7+8=15>>15.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nOn Monday the total number of miles Alice walks to and from school is 10 + 12 = <<10+12=22>>22 miles.\nFor the other 4 days, from Tuesday to Friday, she walks an additional 4 * 22 = <<4*22=88>>88 miles\nThe total number of miles she will have walked by Friday 22 + 88 = <<22+88=110>>110 miles",

            "question": "Q: Mr. Maximilian is a dairy animal farmer and has 140 cows on his farm. Forty percent of the cows on his farm have a red spot, 25 percent of the cows without a red spot have a blue spot and the remaining cows do not have any spot. How many cows on the farm have no spot?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nIf Mr. Maximilian has 140 cows and 40% of them have red spots, then 40/100*140 = <<140*40/100=56>>56 cows have red spots.\nThe number of cows with no red spot is 140-56 = <<140-56=84>>84 cows.\nOut of the 84 cows without a red spot, 25% of them have a blue spot, a total of 25/100*84 = <<25/100*84=21>>21 cows.\nThe number of cows without any spot is 84-21 =<<84-21=63>>63 animals.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nFirst find how far Glenda goes in 3 hours by multiplying her speed by the number of hours she travels: 3 hours * 8 miles/hour = <<3*8=24>>24 miles\nThen do the same thing for Ann: 3 hours * 6 miles/hour = <<3*6=18>>18 miles\nNow add the number of miles both people skated to find the total distance between them: 18 miles + 24 miles = <<18+24=42>>42 miles",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nMerry had a total of 50 + 25 = <<50+25=75>>75 boxes of apples.\nThese 75 boxes is equal to 75 x 10 = <<75*10=750>>750 apples.\nThere were 750 - 720 = <<750-720=30>>30 apples left.\nThus, 30/10 = <<30/10=3>>3 boxes of apples are left.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nOn the third day, there were one-third of the number of bedbugs as the fourth day, so there were 810 / 3 = <<810/3=270>>270 bedbugs.\nOn the second day, there were one-third of the third dayâ€™s bedbugs, so there were 270 / 3 = <<270/3=90>>90 bedbugs.\nOn the first day, there were 90 / 3 = <<90/3=30>>30 bedbugs in the group to start with.",
