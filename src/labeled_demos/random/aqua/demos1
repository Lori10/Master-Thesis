            "rationale": "Let's think step by step.\nUsually, you are given the annual rate of interest and it is mentioned that it is annual rate.\nThe bank charges him a quarterly compounded ANNUAL rate of 16%.\nHere you find per quarter rate as (16/4)% = 4%\nI have actually never seen a question with quarter rate given but since this question did not mentionannual rate of interestand since the options did not make sense with 4% annual rate of interest, it is apparent that the intent was a 4% quarterly rate. So the bank charges 4% every quarter and compounds it in the next quarter. Had it been a simple quarterly rate, we would have just found 4 * 4% of 10,000 = $1600 as our answer.\nBut since, the interest is compounded, it will be a bit more than $1600. Option (A) looks correct.",
