            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nArthur is 2 years older than Susan, so he is 15 + 2 = <<15+2=17>>17 years old.\nBob is 11 years old, so Tom is 11 - 3 = <<11-3=8>>8 years old.\nSo in total these four family members have 11 + 15 + 17 + 8 = <<11+15+17+8=51>>51 years.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nA kilogram of chicken costs $6 - $2 = $<<6-2=4>>4.\nThree kilograms of chicken cost $4 x 3 = $<<4*3=12>>12.\nSo, a 3-kilogram of chicken and a kilogram of pork cost $12 + $6 = $18.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nIf each spoonful contains 4 clusters of oats, and each bowl of cereal has 25 spoonfuls, then in each bowl there are 4*25=<<4*25=100>>100 clusters of oats.\nAnd If each box of cereal contains 500 clusters of oats, then there are 500/100=<<500/100=5>>5 bowlfuls of cereal in every box.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nRebecca bought 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 bottles of soda.\nA week is 7 days, so she will drink 4 * 7 = <<4*7=28>>28 half bottles of soda in four weeks.\nA bottle is two half bottles, so she will drink 28 / 2 = <<28/2=14>>14 bottles of soda in four weeks.\nThus, after 4 weeks, she will have 18 - 14 = <<18-14=4>>4 bottles of soda left.",

            "question": "Q: Eastern rattlesnakes have 6 segments in their tails, while Western rattlesnakes have 8 segments. What is the percentage difference in their tail size, expressed as a percentage of the Western rattlesnake's tail size?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nFirst find the difference in size between the two kinds of snake tail: 8 segments - 6 segments = <<8-6=2>>2 segments\nThen divide that amount by the size of the Western rattlesnake's tail and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 2 segments / 8 segments * 100% = 25%",
