            "question": "Q: Antonio is preparing a meal of spaghetti and meatballs for his family.  His recipe for meatballs calls for 1/8 of a pound of hamburger per meatball.  Antonio has 8 family members, including himself.  If he uses 4 pounds of hamburger to make meatballs, and each member of the family eats an equal number of meatballs, how many meatballs will Antonio eat?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nIf one meatball is made from 1/8 pound of hamburger meat, then 4 pounds of hamburger meat will make 4/(1/8)=4*8=<<4/(1/8)=32>>32 meatballs.\n32 meatballs divided amongst 8 family members is 32/8=<<32/8=4>>4 meatballs per family member.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nFirst find how old Bethany's sister currently is: 16 years - 5 years = <<16-5=11>>11 years\nThen find how old her sister was 3 years ago: 11 years - 3 years = <<11-3=8>>8 years\nThen double that age to find how old Bethany was three years ago: 8 years * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 years\nThen add 3 years to that number to find how old Bethany is now: 16 years + 3 years = <<16+3=19>>19 years",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nA kilogram of chicken costs $6 - $2 = $<<6-2=4>>4.\nThree kilograms of chicken cost $4 x 3 = $<<4*3=12>>12.\nSo, a 3-kilogram of chicken and a kilogram of pork cost $12 + $6 = $18.",

The deck of playing cards had 52 cards, and Eugene used all but 16 of the cards to build his house.  If a box of toothpicks contains 450 toothpicks, how many boxes of toothpicks did Eugene use to create his model house?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nIf Eugene used all but 16 of the 52 cards, then he used 52-16=<<52-16=36>>36 cards.\nIf for every card he used 75 toothpicks, then a box of toothpicks would have enough toothpicks for 450/75=<<450/75=6>>6 cards.\nSince one box has enough toothpicks for 6 cards, then for 36 cards he would need 36/6=<<36/6=6>>6 boxes of toothpicks.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nOn the second day, the snail kite ate 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 apple snails.\nOn the third day, the snail kite ate 5 + 2 = <<5+2=7>>7 apple snails.\nOn the fourth day, the snail kite ate 7 + 2 = <<7+2=9>>9 apple snails.\nOn the fifth day, the snail kite ate 9 + 2 = <<9+2=11>>11 apple snails.\nThe snail kite ate a total of 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = <<3+5+7+9+11=35>>35 apple snails in 5\ndays.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nFirst find the total number of blue sequins: 6 rows * 8 sequins/row = <<6*8=48>>48 sequins\nThen find the total number of purple sequins: 5 rows * 12 sequins/row = <<5*12=60>>60 sequins\nThen find the total number of green sequins: 9 rows * 6 sequins/row = <<9*6=54>>54 sequins\nThen add the number of each color of sequin to find the total number of sequins: 48 sequins + 60 sequins + 54 sequins = <<48+60+54=162>>162 sequins",
