            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nThe cost of Gary’s gold is 30 * $15 = $<<30*15=450>>450.\nThe cost of Anna’s gold is 50 * $20 = $<<50*20=1000>>1000.\nThe total cost of their gold is $450 + $1000 = $<<450+1000=1450>>1450.",

If the number of people going to the fair this year is 600, calculate the number of people at the fair in the three years.",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nIf there are 600 people at the fair this year, the number going to the fair next year is 2*600 = <<2*600=1200>>1200.\nThe number of people at the fair this year and the ones going next year totals 1200+600 = <<1200+600=1800>>1800\nThe number of people who went to that fair last year was 200 less than those going next year, meaning there were 1200-200 = 1000 people at the fair last year.\nIn the three years, the number of people at the fair will be 1800 of this and next year + 1000 of last year = <<1800+1000=2800>>2800",

As she went back through her inventory she noticed that she sold $11 worth of small lemonades and $24 worth of medium lemonades. How many cups of large lemonade did Tonya sell?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\n1. Tonya sold $11 worth of small lemonades and $24 worth of medium lemonades which makes $11 + $24= $<<11+24=35>>35 for small and medium lemonades.\n2. Tonya made a total of $50. If she made $35 selling the two smaller sizes and she sold three sizes in all then $50-$35= $<<50-35=15>>15 worth of large lemonades.\n3. The large lemonades sold for $3 each and Tonya sold $15 worth of large lemonades which means she sold $15/$3=<<15/3=5>>5 large cups of lemonade.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nTo get the number of people at Taylor's party, we'll assume there were n people at his party.\nThe total number of people at Ryan's party is 4*n, four times the number of attendees at Taylor's party.\nCombined, there were 4n+n = 240 people at both parties.\nThis translates to 5n=240.\nThe total number of people at Taylor's party is n=240/5\nThere were n=<<48=48>>48 people at Taylor's party.\nSince Ryan's party was 4 times as huge as Taylor's party, at Ryan's party, there were 48*4 = <<48*4=192>>192 people.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nFirst, calculate how many square feet of road Mark needs to cover by multiplying the length by the width: 2000 feet * 20 feet = <<2000*20=40000>>40,000 sq ft\nThen divide the square footage of road by the number of square feet each truckload will cover: 40,000 sq ft / 800 sq ft/truckload = <<40000/800=50>>50 truckloads\nNow multiply the number of truckloads by the cost per truckload: $75/truckload * 50 truckloads = $<<75*50=3750>>3750\nNow calculate the sales tax by multiplying $3750 by 20%: $3750 * .2 = $<<3750*.2=750>>750\nNow add the sales tax to the cost of the asphalt to find the total: $750 + $3750 = $<<750+3750=4500>>4500",
