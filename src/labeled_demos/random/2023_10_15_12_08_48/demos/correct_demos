Let the fraction be x/y. \n\nAccording to the problem, \n\nx/y - y/x = 9/20 \n\nMultiplying both sides by xy, we get \n\nx^2 - y^2 = 9xy/20 \n\nSimplifying, \n\n20x^2 - 20y^2 = 9xy \n\n20x^2 - 9xy - 20y^2 = 0 \n\nWe can factor this as \n\n(4x - 5y)(5x + 4y) = 0 \n\nSo either 4x - 5y = 0 or 5x + 4y = 0. \n\nIf 4x - 5y = 0, then x/y = 5/4. \n\nIf 5x + 4y = 0, then x/y = -4/5, but this is not a positive proper fraction. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 4/5.",
