            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nAndre had $1350 x 30/100 = $<<1350*30/100=405>>405 discount for the treadmill.\nSo, a treadmill cost $1350 - $405 = $<<1350-405=945>>945.\nTwo 45-pound plates cost $50 x 2 = $100.\nSo, Andre paid a total of $945 + $100 = $<<945+100=1045>>1045.",

Her little cousin Andy ate 3 slices from the bread at two different points in time, and then Emma decided she would make toast with the remaining slices. If she uses 2 slices of bread to make 1 piece of toast bread, how many slices were in the original loaf if she was able to make 10 pieces of toast bread and had 1 slice of bread left?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nLittle Andy ate 3 slices 2 times giving a total of 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 slices of bread\n1 piece of toast bread requires 2 slices of bread so 10 pieces need 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 slices of bread\nThere is 1 slice of bread left so in total there were 6+20+1=<<6+20+1=27>>27 slices of bread in the loaf",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nSaturday's total was 2*40-10=<<2*40-10=70>>70.\nSunday's was 70/2=<<70/2=35>>35.\nThe sum is 40+70+35=<<40+70+35=145>>145.",

Each chicken will need 2 pounds of feed from the time it hatches to the time he sells it. If he makes $65 profit from selling chickens, how many did he sell?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nA bag of feed is enough for 10 chickens because 20 / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10\nEach chicken costs $.2 to raise because 2 / 10 = <<2/10=.2>>.2\nEach chicken results in $1.3 of profit because 1.5 - .2 = <<1.5-.2=1.3>>1.3\nHe sells 50 chickens because 65 / 1.3 = <<65/1.3=50>>50",
