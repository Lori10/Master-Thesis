Thus, the two numbers could be...\n2 and 3\n4 and 6\n6 and 9\n8 and 12\n10 and 15\nEtc.\nWe're told that ADDING 4 to each number changes the ratio of the numbers to 5:7. We're asked for the DIFFERENCE between the original numbers.\nSince adding 4 makes the first number a multiple of 5, this limits the possibilities....\n2+4 = 6 NOT POSSIBLE\n4+4 = 8 NOT POSSIBLE\n6+4 = 10 This IS possible...Using this example, we would have...\n6 and 9, after adding 4 to each, becomes10 and 13...this is NOT a ratio of 5 to 7 though (even though it's pretty close), so we have to keep looking....\nThe next value that becomes a multiple of 5 when you add 4 to it is...16...\n16 + 4 = 20\nWith16 and 24, after adding 4 to each, we have20 and 28.This IS a ratio of 5 to 7, so we have our pair of original numbers.\nThe difference between them is 8.\nFinal Answer:\nA",
