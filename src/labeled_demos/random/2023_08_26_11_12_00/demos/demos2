            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nThe first 5 days cost 5*100=$<<5*100=500>>500\nHe gets 10-5=<<10-5=5>>5 days on discount\nHe paid 5*60=$<<5*60=300>>300 at the discounted rate\nSo in total he pays 500+300=$<<500+300=800>>800",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nAccommodation is 15% * $1000=$<<15*.01*1000=150>>150\nFood is          30% * $1000=$<<30*.01*1000=300>>300\nEntertainment is   25% * $1000=$<<25*.01*1000=250>>250\nCoursework materials are thus $1000-($150+$300+$250) = $300",
