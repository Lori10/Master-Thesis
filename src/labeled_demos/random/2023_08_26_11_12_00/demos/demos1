The first tree she climbs is 50 feet tall and has 200 branches. The second tree she climbs is 40 feet tall and has 180 branches. The third tree she climbs is 60 feet tall and has 180 branches. The final tree she climbs is 34 feet tall and has 153 branches. On average, how many branches do these trees have per foot?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nThe first tree has 4 branches per foot because 200 / 50 = <<200/50=4>>4\nThe second tree tree has 4.5 branches per foot because 180 / 40 = <<180/40=4.5>>4.5\nThe third tree has 3 branches per foot because 180 / 60 = <<180/60=3>>3\nThe fourth tree has 4.5 branches per foot because 153 / 34 = <<153/34=4.5>>4.5\nThe total branches per foot is 16 because 4 + 4.5 + 3 + 4.5 = <<4+4.5+3+4.5=16>>16\nThe average branches per foot is 4 because 16 / 4 = <<16/4=4>>4",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nIf Mr. Maximilian has 140 cows and 40% of them have red spots, then 40/100*140 = <<140*40/100=56>>56 cows have red spots.\nThe number of cows with no red spot is 140-56 = <<140-56=84>>84 cows.\nOut of the 84 cows without a red spot, 25% of them have a blue spot, a total of 25/100*84 = <<25/100*84=21>>21 cows.\nThe number of cows without any spot is 84-21 =<<84-21=63>>63 animals.",
