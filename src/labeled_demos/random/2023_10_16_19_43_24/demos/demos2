            "question": "Q: Youngsville had a population of 684 people.  The town had a growth spurt and the population increased by 25% then they witnessed that 40% of the population moved away.  What is the current population?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people were added to the population when it increased by 25%. To do this, we can multiply the original population by 0.25: 684 x 0.25 = 171 So the population increased by 171 people, bringing the total population to: 684 + 171 = 855 Next, we need to find out how many people moved away when 40% of the population left. To do this, we can multiply the current population by 0.4: 855 x 0.4 = 342 So 342 people moved away, leaving the current population at: 855 - 342 = 513 Therefore, the current population of Youngsville is 513 people.",

            "question": "Q: Yvette wants to frame a new picture. When she goes to her local frame shop, she finds out that the frame she wanted is 20% more expensive than her budget of $60. If she paid for a smaller frame at 3/4 the new price of the frame she initially intended to buy, how much money did she remain with?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out the price of the frame Yvette initially intended to buy. We know that it is 20% more expensive than her budget of $60, so we can set up an equation: Price of initial frame = $60 + 20% of $60 Price of initial frame = $60 + $12 Price of initial frame = $72 Next, we need to find out the price of the smaller frame that Yvette ended up buying. We know that it is 3/4 the price of the initial frame, so we can set up another equation: Price of smaller frame = 3/4 x $72 Price of smaller frame = $54 Finally, we need to find out how much money Yvette remained with. We know that she initially had a budget of $60, but she ended up spending $54 on the smaller frame. So we can subtract the price of the smaller frame from her budget: Money Yvette remained with = $60 - $54 Money Yvette remained with = $6 Therefore, Yvette remained with $6 after buying the smaller frame.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the cost per serving of the spirits. To do this, we divide the total cost of the bottle by the number of servings: $30.00 รท 16 servings = $1.875 per serving Next, we need to find how much the restaurant charges per serving: $8.00 per serving Finally, we can calculate the profit the restaurant makes on a bottle of spirits by subtracting the cost per serving from the price charged per serving and then multiplying by the number of servings: ($8.00 per serving - $1.875 per serving) x 16 servings = $94.00 Therefore, the restaurant makes $94.00 on a bottle of spirits.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people were left on the team after 8 people quit. To do this, we can subtract 8 from the original total of 25: 25 - 8 = 17 So there were 17 people left on the team after 8 people quit. Next, we need to add the 13 new people who joined the team: 17 + 13 = 30 Therefore, there are now 30 people on the team.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many servings of chicken and sides Monty needs to feed 36 people. Since the restaurant's 8 piece fried chicken bucket feeds 6 people, we can calculate that Monty needs 6 buckets of chicken to feed 36 people. Next, we need to figure out how many sides Monty needs. The restaurant offers 2 sides with each 8 piece chicken bucket, so Monty needs 6 x 2 = 12 sides. Now, we can calculate the total cost. Monty is paying $12.00 for 6 people, so he needs to pay 6/6 = 1 dollar per person. To feed 36 people, Monty needs to pay 36 x 1 = $36.00 for the chicken and sides.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days Larry jogs in two weeks. Larry jogs for 3 days in the first week and 5 days in the second week, so he jogs for a total of 3 + 5 = 8 days in two weeks. Next, we need to find out how many hours Larry jogs in one day. Larry jogs for 30 minutes each day, which is equivalent to 0.5 hours. Finally, we can calculate how many hours Larry jogs in total for two weeks by multiplying the number of days by the number of hours per day: 8 days x 0.5 hours per day = 4 hours Therefore, Larry jogs for a total of 4 hours in two weeks.",

Classroom A has raised $20 from each of two families, $10 from each of eight families, and $5  from each of ten families. How much more money does Classroom A need in order to reach the goal?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total amount of money raised by Classroom A so far: - $20 x 2 = $40 (from two families) - $10 x 8 = $80 (from eight families) - $5 x 10 = $50 (from ten families) Total raised so far = $40 + $80 + $50 = $170 Next, let's calculate how much more money Classroom A needs to reach the goal: Goal amount = $200 Amount raised so far = $170 Amount needed to reach goal = Goal amount - Amount raised so far Amount needed to reach goal = $200 - $170 Amount needed to reach goal = $30 Therefore, Classroom A needs $30 more to reach the goal of raising $200 for the community outreach program.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of pets that Heloise has. We know that the ratio of dogs to cats is 10:17, which means that for every 10 dogs, there are 17 cats. Let's call the number of dogs Heloise has \"10x\" and the number of cats \"17x\". So, the total number of pets is: 10x + 17x = 189 27x = 189 x = 7 This means that Heloise has 10x = 10(7) = 70 dogs and 17x = 17(7) = 119 cats. Now, if she gives 10 dogs to Janet, she will have: 70 - 10 = 60 dogs So, Heloise will have 60 dogs remaining altogether.",
