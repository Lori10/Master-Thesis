Last month he sold eight large paintings and four small paintings. If he sold twice as much this month, how much is his sales for this month?\nA:",
            "rationale": "Let's think step by step.\nNoah earned $60/large painting x 8 large paintings = $<<60*8=480>>480 for the large paintings.\nHe also earned $30/small painting x 4 small paintings = $<<30*4=120>>120 for the small paintings.\nHis total sales last month were $480 + $120 = $<<480+120=600>>600.\nSo, his sales this month are $600 x 2 = $<<600*2=1200>>1200.",

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step.\nIn the first four houses, there are a total of 4 houses * 3 gnomes = <<4*3=12>>12 gnomes.\nTherefore, the fifth house had 20 total gnomes â€“ 12 gnomes = <<20-12=8>>8 gnomes.",

If Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats, and John takes away 6 pink hard hats and twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats that he removed, then calculate the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck.\nA:",
