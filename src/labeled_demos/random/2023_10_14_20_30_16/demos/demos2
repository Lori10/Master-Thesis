            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the cost price of the item is $100. If the selling price is quadrupled, the new selling price would be $400. Let's say the profit made at the original selling price was $x. If the profit is pentadrupled, the new profit would be $5x. Profit = Selling price - Cost price So, x = Selling price - $100 $5x = $400 - $100 $5x = $300 x = $60 Therefore, the original profit was $60 and the new profit is $300. Percentage increase in profit = (New profit - Original profit) / Original profit * 100 = (300 - 60) / 60 * 100 = 400% So, the answer is (D) 200%.",

If 20 candidates are sent from B to A, then the number of students in A is double the number of students in B. The number of students in room A is: Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 110 (C) 120 (D) 130 (E) 140",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the initial number of students in room A is \"x\" and in room B is \"y\". According to the first condition, if 10 students are sent from A to B, then the number of students in each room is the same. So, after the transfer, the number of students in each room will be (x-10) and (y+10). According to the second condition, if 20 candidates are sent from B to A, then the number of students in A is double the number of students in B. So, after the transfer, the number of students in each room will be (x+20) and (y-20/2) = (y-10). Now, we can equate both expressions for the number of students in room B: y+10 = y-10/2 Solving for y, we get: y = 30 Substituting this value in the expression for the number of students in room A, we get: x+20 = 2(y-10) x+20 = 2(30-10) x+20 = 40 x = 20 Therefore, the number of students in room A is 20+20 = 40. None of the above answer choices are correct.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total cost of the first purchase of 10 t-shirts. Total cost of 10 t-shirts = 10 x $14 = $140 Step 2: Find the total cost of the second purchase of 15 t-shirts. Total cost of 15 t-shirts = 15 x $11 = $165 Step 3: Find the total cost of both purchases. Total cost of both purchases = $140 + $165 = $305 Step 4: Find the total number of t-shirts purchased. Total number of t-shirts = 10 + 15 = 25 Step 5: Find the average price per t-shirt. Average price per t-shirt = Total cost of both purchases / Total number of t-shirts D = $305 / 25 = $12.20 Therefore, the answer is (A) $12.20.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the value of (x-y)!. Since x=16, we have (16-y)!. Next, we need to find the remainder when (16-y)! is divided by 16. This means we need to find the largest value of y such that (16-y)! is divisible by 16. We know that 16=2^4, so we need to find the largest power of 2 that divides (16-y)!. We can use the formula for the highest power of a prime p that divides n!, which is given by: ⌊n/p⌋ + ⌊n/p^2⌋ + ⌊n/p^3⌋ + ... where ⌊x⌋ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. In this case, p=2 and n=16-y, so we have: ⌊(16-y)/2⌋ + ⌊(16-y)/4⌋ + ⌊(16-y)/8⌋ + ⌊(16-y)/16⌋ Simplifying this expression, we get: 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15 So the largest power of 2 that divides (16-y)! is 2^15. Therefore, the maximum value of y for which f(x,y)=0 is 15. The answer is (C) 15.",
