            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 9.6 kg to grams: 9.6 kg = 9.6 x 1000 g = 9600 g Now we can set up the proportion: 28 g / 9600 g = x / 100 Solving for x: x = (28 x 100) / 9600 x = 0.29 So the answer is approximately 29%. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 29.",

If 200 grams of solution P are mixed with 800 grams of solution Q, then liquid X accounts for what percent of the weight of the resulting solution? Answer Choices: (A) 1.3% (B) 1.2% (C) 1.1% (D) 1.0% (E) 0.9%",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much liquid X is in 200 grams of solution P and 800 grams of solution Q. Liquid X in 200 grams of solution P = 0.5% of 200 grams = 1 gram Liquid X in 800 grams of solution Q = 1.5% of 800 grams = 12 grams Total liquid X in the resulting solution = 1 gram + 12 grams = 13 grams Now, we need to find out what percent of the weight of the resulting solution is 13 grams. Total weight of resulting solution = 200 grams + 800 grams = 1000 grams Percent of liquid X in the resulting solution = (13 grams / 1000 grams) x 100% = 1.3% Therefore, the answer is (A) 1.3%.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. We can start by assuming four consecutive natural numbers as n, n+1, n+2, and n+3. The product of these four numbers would be: n x (n+1) x (n+2) x (n+3) = n(n+3) x (n+1)(n+2) = (n^2 + 3n) x (n^2 + 3n + 2) = n^4 + 6n^3 + 11n^2 + 6n Now, we need to find the largest natural number that exactly divides this expression. We can see that 2 and 3 both divide the expression. To check if any larger number divides the expression, we can try to factorize it. n^4 + 6n^3 + 11n^2 + 6n = n(n^3 + 6n^2 + 11n + 6) = n(n+1)(n^2 + 5n + 6) = n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3) So, the largest natural number that exactly divides the product of any four consecutive natural numbers is the product of the four consecutive numbers divided by their LCM. LCM of (n, n+1, n+2, n+3) = (n+3) if n is not divisible by 3, otherwise LCM = 3(n+3). Therefore, the largest natural number that exactly divides the product of any four consecutive natural numbers is 3 x (n+3) if n is divisible by 3, otherwise it is (n+3). Looking at the answer choices, we can see that (C) 24 is the correct answer.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 3 hours 45 minutes into seconds. 3 hours = 3 x 60 x 60 = 10,800 seconds 45 minutes = 45 x 60 = 2,700 seconds Total time = 10,800 + 2,700 = 13,500 seconds Now, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time The man's speed is 12 metres per second. So, distance covered in 13,500 seconds = 12 x 13,500 = 162,000 metres We need to convert this to kilometres: 1 kilometre = 1000 metres So, distance covered in 3 hours 45 minutes = 162,000/1000 = 162 kilometres Therefore, the answer is (B) 162.",
