            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. The shopkeeper sold 200 meters of cloth for Rs. 12000, which means he sold each meter for Rs. 60 (12000/200). Now, we know that he sold each meter at a loss of Rs. 6. So, his cost price for each meter would be Rs. 66 (60+6). Therefore, the correct answer is (E) Rs. 66.",

If all seven contestants finish (including Charles Barkley) and there are no ties, how many different arrangements of finishes are there in which Carmelo defeats LeBron? Answer Choices: (A)  5040 (B)  2520 (C)  720 (D)  120 (E)  42",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to choose the positions for Carmelo and LeBron. There are 2 options for the first place, and once that is decided, there is only 1 option for the second place. Next, we need to arrange the remaining 5 people in the remaining 5 positions. There are 5 options for the third place, 4 options for the fourth place, 3 options for the fifth place, 2 options for the sixth place, and 1 option for the seventh place. Therefore, the total number of arrangements in which Carmelo defeats LeBron is 2 x 1 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 240. None of the answer choices match our result, so the answer is None of the above.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. We know that a:b = 4:1, which means that a = 4b. Substituting this value of a in the expression (a - 3b)/(2a - b), we get: (4b - 3b)/(2(4b) - b) = b/(8b - b) = b/7b = 1/7 Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 1/7.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. Linda bought 3 notebooks at $1.20 each, so she spent 3 x $1.20 = $3.60 on notebooks. She also bought a box of pencils at $1.50 and a box of pens at $1.70, so she spent $1.50 + $1.70 = $3.20 on stationery. Therefore, Linda spent a total of $3.60 + $3.20 = $6.80.
