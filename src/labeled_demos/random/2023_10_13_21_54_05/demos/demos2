            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. Time taken by bus to travel from St. Louis to Chicago and back comes to St. Louis = 3 hours Time taken by bus to travel from St. Louis to Springfield and back comes to St. Louis = 7 hours Time taken by both buses to meet again in St. Louis will be LCM of 3 and 7 = 21 If the buses start at 01:00 o'clock from St. Louis , they will meet again in St. Louis at 22:00 hours Answer D",
