After 45 mins Pam would have covered 45/60 * 10 mph = 7.5 miles Cathy would have covered 45/60 * 8 mph = 6 miles Pam does 30 minutes of stretching .. so after 75 mins Pam would still be at 7.5 miles Cathy would have covered 75/60 * 8 = 10 miles. So after 75 mins Cathy is 2.5 miles ahead. ANSWER:E",
