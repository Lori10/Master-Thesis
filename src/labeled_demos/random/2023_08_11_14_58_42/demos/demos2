Kyla can fold 5 towels in 10 minutes, and Anthony can fold 7 towels in 20 minutes. If they all fold towels together, how many towels can they fold in one hour?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nThere are 1 x 60 minutes = <<1*60=60>>60 minutes in 1 hour.\nThere are 60/5 = <<60/5=12>>12 sets of 5 minutes in 1 hour.\nSo, Jane can fold 3 x 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 towels in an hour.\nThere are 60/10 = <<60/10=6>>6 sets of 10 minutes in 1 hour.\nSo, Kyla can fold 5 x 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 towels in an hour.\nThere are 60/20 = <<60/20=3>>3 sets of 20 minutes in 1 hour.\nSo, Anthony can fold 7 x 3 = <<7*3=21>>21 towels in an hour.\nTherefore, the 3 of them can fold a total of 36 + 30 + 21 = <<36+30+21=87>>87 towels in 1 hour.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nSince each water bottle has a capacity of 12 liters, when filled up to 3/4 of capacity, each carries 3/4*12 = <<3/4*12=9>>9 liters of water.\nIf there are 50 bottles of water in each box, the number of liters the water bottles in a box are carrying is 50*9 = <<50*9=450>>450 liters.\nIn 10 boxes containing bottled water, the total number of liters in the water bottles is 450*10 =<<450*10=4500>>4500 liters.",
