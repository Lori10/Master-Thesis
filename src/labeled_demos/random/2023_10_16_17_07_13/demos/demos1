            "question": "Q: There are 40 balls which are red, blue or green. If 15 balls are green and the sum of red balls and green balls is less than 25, at most how many red balls are there? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 9",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. Given that there are 40 balls in total and 15 of them are green, we can find the number of red balls by subtracting the number of green and blue balls from the total number of balls: Number of red balls = Total number of balls - Number of green balls - Number of blue balls We don't know the number of blue balls, but we do know that the sum of red and green balls is less than 25. So we can write: Number of red balls + Number of green balls < 25 Substituting the value of the number of green balls, we get: Number of red balls + 15 < 25 Simplifying, we get: Number of red balls < 10 So the maximum number of red balls is 9. Therefore, the answer is (E) 9.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Calculate the amount of sulphuric acid in the 150 ml of 30% solution. 30% of 150 ml = (30/100) x 150 ml = 45 ml Step 2: Calculate the amount of sulphuric acid in the 400 ml of 12% solution. 12% of 400 ml = (12/100) x 400 ml = 48 ml Step 3: Calculate the total amount of sulphuric acid in the mixture. 45 ml + 48 ml = 93 ml Step 4: Calculate the total volume of the mixture. 150 ml + 400 ml = 550 ml Step 5: Calculate the concentration of the sulphuric acid in the mixture. Q = (93/550) x 100% Q = 16.91% None of the answer choices match the calculated concentration, so the answer is None of the above.",

            "question": "Q: A jar full of whisky contains 40% alcohol. A part of this whisky is replaced by another containg 19% alcohol and now the percentage of alcohol was found to be 22%. What quantity of whisky is replaced ? Answer Choices: (A) 1/3 (B) 2/3 (C) 2/5 (D) 3/5 (E) 4/5",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the jar initially contains 100 units of whisky. Out of these 100 units, 40 units are alcohol. Let's say x units of whisky are replaced with the new whisky containing 19% alcohol. So, the amount of alcohol in the new mixture will be: 40 - 0.4x (alcohol in the original mixture) + 0.19x (alcohol in the new mixture) The total amount of whisky in the new mixture will be: 100 - x (original amount) + x (new amount) Now, we are given that the percentage of alcohol in the new mixture is 22%. So, we can set up the equation: (40 - 0.4x + 0.19x)/(100) = 0.22 Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 2/5 Therefore, 2/5 of the original amount of whisky is replaced with the new whisky containing 19% alcohol. So, the answer is (C) 2/5.",
