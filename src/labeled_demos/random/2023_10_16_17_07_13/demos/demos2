            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find 60% of 900, which is 0.6 x 900 = 540. Next, we can set up the equation: 45 x ? = 540 To solve for ?, we can divide both sides by 45: ? = 540/45 ? = 12 Therefore, the answer is (B) 12.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. The difference between 5 and 8 is 3, between 8 and 10 is 2, between 10 and 12 is 2, and between 12 and 16 is 4. So, it seems like the differences are not following a specific pattern. To find the missing number, we can try to look for other patterns. One possible pattern is that the numbers are increasing by 1, then 2, then 2, then 4, and so on. Following this pattern, the next number should increase by 4, making it 16 + 4 = 20. However, this number is not among the answer choices. The closest answer choice is (D) 21, which is an increase of 5 from the previous number. This pattern is also possible, as it would be an increase of 1, then 2, then 2, then 5. Therefore, the answer is (D) 21.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step. The formula for calculating the number of standard deviations a value is from the mean is: z = (x - μ) / σ where z is the number of standard deviations, x is the value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation. We want to find the value that is more than 2.5 standard deviations from the mean. So we need to find the value of z that corresponds to 2.5 standard deviations. We can use the z-score table or a calculator to find that the z-score for 2.5 standard deviations is approximately 0.9938. Now we can use the formula to solve for x: 0.9938 = (x - 21) / 3 Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: 2.9814 = x - 21 Adding 21 to both sides, we get: x = 23.9814 So the value that is more than 2.5 standard deviations from the mean is approximately 23.98. The closest answer choice is (D) 23.5, which is less than 2.5 standard deviations from the mean. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above.",

Seven years ago, their ages were (4x-7), (7x-7), and (9x-7), respectively. According to the problem, the sum of their ages seven years ago was 79: (4x-7) + (7x-7) + (9x-7) = 79 Simplifying the equation: 20x - 21 = 79 20x = 100 x = 5 Therefore, their present ages are: 4x = 20 7x = 35 9x = 45 So the answer is (C) 35, 45.",
