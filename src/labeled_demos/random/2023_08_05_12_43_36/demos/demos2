            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nFind the number of students who got their degree by multiplying: 804 students * 75% = <<804*75*.01=603>>603 students.\nThen find the number of students who didn't pass their exams by subtracting this number from the total: 804 students - 603 students = <<804-603=201>>201 students.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nHe gives his dog 2*30=<<2*30=60>>60 treats for the month\nSo that means it cost 60*.1=$<<60*.1=6>>6",

            "question": "Q: Arnold owns three cars. The first car averages 50 miles per gallon of gas. The second car averages 10 miles per gallon of gas. And the third car averages 15 miles per gallon of gas. He splits his 450-mile monthly driving mileage equally amongst his three cars.  If gas costs $2 per gallon, how much does he spend on gas each month?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nHe drives each vehicle 150 miles because 450 / 3 = <<450/3=150>>150\nThe first car will need 3 gallons of gas because 150 / 50 = <<150/50=3>>3\nThe second car will need 15 gallons of gas because 150 / 10 = <<150/10=15>>15\nThe third car will need 10 gallons of gas because 150 / 15 = <<150/15=10>>10\nHe will need 28 gallons in total because 3 + 15 + 10 = <<3+15+10=28>>28\nThis will cost him $56 because 28 x $2 = $<<28*2=56>>56",

During breakfast, they had 73 customers. During lunch, they had 127 customers. During dinner, they had 87 customers. If they predict they'll get twice the amount of customers on Saturday as they had on Friday, how many customers do they predict they will get?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nOn Friday the restaurant had 73 customers for breakfast + 127 customers for lunch + 87 customers for dinner = <<73+127+87=287>>287 customers total on Friday.\nIf they predict getting 2x the amount of customers on Saturday as on Friday, they will have 287 customers x 2 = <<287*2=574>>574 customers on Saturday.",

            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nShe hand washes them every 4 weeks and there are 52 weeks in a year so she washes them 52/4 = <<52/4=13>>13 times per year\nIt takes her 30 minutes to hand wash the pillowcases and she does this 13 times per year for a total of 30*13 = <<30*13=390>>390 minutes per year",

Jen ran third and finished in 30 seconds.  Tiffany ran the last leg and finished in 7 seconds less than Mary.  How many seconds did it take the team to finish the race?",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nSusan's time was 30 seconds + 10 seconds = <<30+10=40>>40 seconds.\nMary's time was 40 seconds * 2 = <<40*2=80>>80 seconds.\nTiffany's time was 80 seconds - 7 seconds = <<80-7=73>>73 seconds.\nThe total time for the team was 80 seconds + 40 seconds + 30 seconds + 73 seconds = <<80+40+30+73=223>>223 seconds.",
