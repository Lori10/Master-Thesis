      "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nLet us start by understand the meaning of 4 > |Number of Apples|\n1) when we write |-x| this means the same as |x|.\n2) Mod is very easy concept if you solve mod question by considering as a distance. when a mod is written as |x-(a)| = b, this means the distance from point 'a' (both side left and right of 'a' on number line) is b. |x-(a)| < b means the distance is between the two extreme distance(left and right side of 'a' on number line, considering the max distance is 'b' from 'a' - as per this scenario.....hence the value of 'a' must be between these two extremes. |x-(a)| > b means the distance is greater than the distance of 'b'..i.e the value of a could be anywhere more than 'b'.\nNow come to the question. Let number of apple packets be ‘a’ and number of oranges packets be ‘b’. First its given |a| < 4 ==> |a-0| < 4 ==> the distance from zero is less than 4. So the point ‘a’ will be -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3 as distance from 0 to these values is less than 4. Number of apple packets is above zero so possible values of ‘a’ left are 1,2,3.\nAs per the given information there are total of 20 fruits and they are in packets (3 per packet for apples and 2 per packets for oranges) so we can write it as follows:\n3a + 2b = 20 ==> b = 10 – (3*a)/2. If b is an integer then ‘a’ must be divisible by 2. If we take only those values of ‘a’ that are divisible by 2 then we are left with 2 only. So there are two packets of apples. If there are two packets of apples then b = 10 – (3*2)/2 ==> b = 7. So we have 7 packets of oranges and 2 packets of apples. So A is the answer. 7 packets (2 orange each) and 2 packets of apples (3 apples each) make 20 fruits in total.",

Compound inequalities often need to be manipulated, and we can use the rules of algebra that we already know, to do this. Just as with equations, whatever we do to one part of a compound inequality, we must do to all parts of the compound inequality. Let’s first isolate n within the inequality.\n1< 5n + 5 < 60\nWe first subtract 5 from all three parts of the inequality, and we obtain:\n-4 < 5n < 55\nNext, we divide both sides of the inequality by 5 and we get:\n-4/5 < n < 11\nThe integers that are greater than -4/5 and less than 4 are 0, 1, 2, and 3. Thus, there are 4 integers that satisfy the inequality 1 < 5n + 5 < 25.\nThe answer is C.",

No one said anything about specific results, especially not on a question that includes so many people.\nMany questions on the GMAT can be overwhelming in appearance so first thing…Relax. This question looks nasty, but it’s pretty straightforward, requiring two things: the basic first calculation and then some additional work to solve the problem. It would be extremely painful to try to calculate this whole question in one fell swoop. So don’t.\nCalculate out all possibilities first to get your bearings. That is, how many different arrangements, period? Since the order of arrangement again matters, this is another permutation. And since we’re placing all seven runners, this calculation is…\n7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1, cash and prizes worth 5040 arrangements.\nNow, what to do? Again, some nice deep breathing to control your nerves – relax and think. These 5040 arrangements are a comprehensive list; every possible seven-person order of finish has been counted. So, we have accounted for every time Carmelo beats LeBron AND every time LeBron beats Carmelo. Doesn’t it make sense that, for every time Carmelo beats LeBron, there is exactly one other instance in which LeBron beats Carmelo? Or more simply, doesn’t it make sense that, if these 5040 represents everything, that Carmelo beats LeBron exactly 50% of the time and vice versa?\nThe thought takes time. You need to have the presence to recognize that grinding your way in, around, and through this question could take roughly forever. Stepping back and recognizing that this is simply a 50/50 proposition and applying that thought to the 5040 you cranked out gives you 2520. The answer is B.",

None of the nuts currently have a ratio of 3 : 4. The cashews and almonds do have a ratio of 2 : 3, but there are not enough pecans in the bowl to complete the ratio.\niii. The ratio 4 : 10 is the same as the given ratio 6 : 15. To see this, multiply the ratio by 3/2 . The new ratio is 6 : 10.5 : 15. Unfortunately, this means that there are fewer cashews that this ratio would require. Removing cashews won’t create the desired ratio.\nAnswer : E",

Since this is a problem-solving question, and there can only be one correct answer, we can select any value for p, as long as it is a prime number greater than 2. We always want to work with small numbers, so we should select 3 for p. Thus, we have:\nn = 4 x 3\nn = 12\nNext we have to determine all the factors, or divisors, of P. Remember the term factor is synonymous with the term divisor.\n1, 12, 6, 2, 4, 3\nFrom this we see that we have 4 even divisors: 12, 6, 2, and 4.\nIf you are concerned that trying just one value of p might not substantiate the answer, try another value for p.

      "question_idx": 258,
      "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nCorrect Answer: A\nExplanation: The relevant formula for this problem is Average D= (Sum)/(Number of Terms). Another way to look at the formula is Sum = Average x Number of Terms. For the first purchase, the vendor's sum (total cost) was $140, since 14 x 10 = 140. For the second purchase, the vendor's cost was $165, since 11 x 15 = 165. The grand sum is then $140 + $165, which equals $305. The total number of shirts purchased was 25, so to get the average price per shirt, we divide 305 by 25, which equals $12.20. As a result, the correct answer is A.\nNOTE: A relative understanding of weighted average offers a shortcut to this problem. Because the true average of 11 and 14 is 12.5, but the vendor sells more shirts at the lower price than at the higher price, the weighted average must be less than $12.50; only answer choice A is a possibility.",
