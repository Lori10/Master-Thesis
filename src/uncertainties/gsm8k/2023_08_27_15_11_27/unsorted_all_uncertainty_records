      "question": "Q: The P.T.O. decided to provide shirts for the elementary students for track and field day. Each grade was given a different color. 101 Kindergartners wore orange shirts that cost $5.80 each. 113 first graders wore yellow shirts that cost $5 each. 107 second graders wore blue shirts that cost $5.60 each. 108 third graders wore green shirts that cost $5.25 each. How much did the P.T.O. spend on shirts for field day?",

      "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nThe cost for 101 Kindergarten shirts x $5.80 = $<<101*5.80=585.80>>585.80.\nThe cost for 113 first grade shirts x $5 = $<<113*5=565>>565.\nThe cost for 107 second grade shirts x $5.60 = $<<107*5.60=599.20>>599.20.\nThe cost for 108 third grade shirts x $5.25 = $<<108*5.25=567>>567.\nThe total cost of the shirts was $585.80 + $565 + $599.20 + $567 = $<<585.8+565+599.2+567=2317>>2,317",
