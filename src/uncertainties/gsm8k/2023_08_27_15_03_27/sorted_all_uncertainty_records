      "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nRupert is younger than Vincent by 2 years, so he is 22 years old – 2 years = <<22-2=20>>20 years old.\nKhloe is 10 years younger than Rupert so she is 20 years old – 10 years = 10 years old.\nEugene is 3 times older than Khloe so he is 10 years old * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 years old.\nYorick is twice Eugene’s age so he is 30 years old * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 years old.\nAmilia is a quarter of Yorick’s age so she is 60 years old / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 years old.\nTricia is a third of Amilia’s age so she is 15 years old / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 years old.",

      "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nThe cost for 101 Kindergarten shirts x $5.80 = $<<101*5.80=585.80>>585.80.\nThe cost for 113 first grade shirts x $5 = $<<113*5=565>>565.\nThe cost for 107 second grade shirts x $5.60 = $<<107*5.60=599.20>>599.20.\nThe cost for 108 third grade shirts x $5.25 = $<<108*5.25=567>>567.\nThe total cost of the shirts was $585.80 + $565 + $599.20 + $567 = $<<585.8+565+599.2+567=2317>>2,317",
