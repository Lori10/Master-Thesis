      "question_idx": 513,
      "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nThe total ratio for the number of cats and dogs that Heloise has is 10+17 = <<10+17=27>>27\nFrom the ratios, the fraction representing the number of dogs is 10/27, and this represents 10/27*189 = <<10/27*189=70>>70 dogs.\nIf Heloise gives 10 of her dogs to Janet, she remains with 70-10 = <<70-10=60>>60 dogs.",

      "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\n35 bones at the end - 10 received = <<35-10=25>>25 on Sunday.\nLassie ate half, so multiply by two to find the number of bones at the beginning which is 25 * 2 = <<25*2=50>>50 bones.",

      "question": "Q: Marly is making soup. He adds 2 quarts of milk and three times as much chicken stock to 1 quart of pureed vegetables. Then he divides the soup into bags that can hold 3 quarts each. How many bags does he need?",
      "question_idx": 514,
      "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nFirst triple the amount of milk to find the amount of chicken stock: 2 quarts * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 quarts\nThen add all three quantities to find the total volume of the soup: 6 quarts + 2 quarts + 1 quart = <<6+2+1=9>>9 quarts\nFinally, divide the number of quarts by the number of quarts per bag to find the number of bags needed: 9 quarts / 3 quarts/bag = <<9/3=3>>3 bags",
