            "rationale": "First, we know that Ben collected a third of what Laurie did. Laurie collected 36 shells, so Ben collected 36/3 = 12 shells.\n\nNext, we know that Alan collected four times as many shells as Ben did. So, Alan collected 4*12 = 48 shells.",

            "question": "Q: Tina makes $18.00 an hour.  If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.  If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?\nA:",
            "rationale": "First, calculate how much Tina makes in a regular 8-hour shift: $18.00/hour * 8 hours = $<<18*8=144.00>>144.00.\n\nNext, calculate how much she makes for the 2 hours of overtime she works each day: $18.00/hour * 1.5 (overtime rate) * 2 hours = $<<18*1.5*2=54.00>>54.00.\n\nAdd these two amounts to find out how much she makes in a day: $144.00 + $54.00 = $<<144+54=198.00>>198.00.\n\nFinally, multiply this daily amount by the number of days she works to find out how much she makes in a week: $198.00/day * 5 days = $<<198*5=990.00>>990.00.",

            "question": "Q: A family of 12 monkeys collected 10 piles of bananas. 6 piles had 9 hands, with each hand having 14 bananas, while the remaining piles had 12 hands, with each hand having 9 bananas. How many bananas would each monkey get if they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves?\nA:",
            "rationale": "First, calculate the total number of bananas in the 6 piles with 9 hands each. Since each hand has 14 bananas, that's 6 piles * 9 hands/pile * 14 bananas/hand = 756 bananas.\n\nNext, calculate the total number of bananas in the remaining 4 piles with 12 hands each. Since each hand has 9 bananas, that's 4 piles * 12 hands/pile * 9 bananas/hand = 432 bananas.\n\nAdd the two amounts to find the total number of bananas: 756 bananas + 432 bananas = 1188 bananas.\n\nFinally, divide the total number of bananas by the number of monkeys to find the number of bananas each monkey gets: 1188 bananas / 12 monkeys = 99 bananas/monkey. So each monkey would get 99 bananas.",

            "rationale": "First, we need to find out how many pages Julie read today. Since she read twice as many pages as yesterday, she read 12 * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 pages today.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pages she has read in total. She read 12 pages yesterday and 24 pages today, so she has read 12 + 24 = <<12+24=36>>36 pages in total.\n\nThen, we need to find out how many pages are left. The book has 120 pages and she has read 36 pages, so there are 120 - 36 = <<120-36=84>>84 pages left.\n\nFinally, if she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, she should read 84 / 2 = <<84/2=42>>42 pages.",

            "rationale": "First, we know that Betty has half of the money she needs, so she has $100 / 2 = $<<100/2=50>>50.\nHer grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents, so they gave her 2 * $15 = $<<2*15=30>>30.\nSo in total, she got $15 + $30 = $<<15+30=45>>45 from her family.\nSo in total, she has $50 + $45 = $<<50+45=95>>95.\nThat means Betty needs $100 - $95 = $<<100-95=5>>5 more to buy the wallet.

            "rationale": "First, calculate how many miles Tim bikes to work and back each day by doubling the distance to work, which is 20 miles * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 miles.\nThen multiply that number by the number of days he works to find the total distance he bikes for work, which is 40 miles/day * 5 days/week = <<40*5=200>>200 miles/week.\nThen add the distance of his weekend ride to find the total distance he bikes in a week, which is 200 miles + 200 miles = <<200+200=400>>400 miles.\nThen divide the total distance by his speed to find how long he spends biking, which is 400 miles / 25 mph = <<400/25=16>>16 hours.
