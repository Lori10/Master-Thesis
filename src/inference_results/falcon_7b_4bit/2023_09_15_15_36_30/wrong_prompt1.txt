{'prompt': "You are an expert at arithmetic reasoning and are willing to solve grade school math problems. To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\nQ: Daisy is climbing trees all around her neighborhood and starts to notice the number of branches and the height. The first tree she climbs is 50 feet tall and has 200 branches. The second tree she climbs is 40 feet tall and has 180 branches. The third tree she climbs is 60 feet tall and has 180 branches. The final tree she climbs is 34 feet tall and has 153 branches. On average, how many branches do these trees have per foot?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe first tree has 4 branches per foot because 200 / 50 = <<200/50=4>>4\nThe second tree tree has 4.5 branches per foot because 180 / 40 = <<180/40=4.5>>4.5\nThe third tree has 3 branches per foot because 180 / 60 = <<180/60=3>>3\nThe fourth tree has 4.5 branches per foot because 153 / 34 = <<153/34=4.5>>4.5\nThe total branches per foot is 16 because 4 + 4.5 + 3 + 4.5 = <<4+4.5+3+4.5=16>>16\nThe average branches per foot is 4 because 16 / 4 = <<16/4=4>>4 The answer is 4.\n\nQ: Mr. Maximilian is a dairy animal farmer and has 140 cows on his farm. Forty percent of the cows on his farm have a red spot, 25 percent of the cows without a red spot have a blue spot and the remaining cows do not have any spot. How many cows on the farm have no spot?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nIf Mr. Maximilian has 140 cows and 40% of them have red spots, then 40/100*140 = <<140*40/100=56>>56 cows have red spots.\nThe number of cows with no red spot is 140-56 = <<140-56=84>>84 cows.\nOut of the 84 cows without a red spot, 25% of them have a blue spot, a total of 25/100*84 = <<25/100*84=21>>21 cows.\nThe number of cows without any spot is 84-21 =<<84-21=63>>63 animals. The answer is 63.\n\nQ: Peter and Kristin are to read 20 fantasy novels each in a week. Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin. If Peter reads one book in 18 hours, how long will Kristin read half of her books?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nSince Peter reads three times as fast as Kristin, Kristin will take 18*3 = <<18*3=54>>54 hours to read one book.\nKristin reads half of her books, a total of 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 books.\nThe time Kristin will take to read half of her books is 10*54 = <<10*54=540>>540 The answer is 540.\n\nQ: Cristine bought a dozen lemons and gave 1/4 of them to her neighbor. How many lemons does Cristine have left?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nCristine bought 1 x 12 = <<1*12=12>>12 lemons.\nShe gave 12 x 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 lemons to her neighbor.\nSo, Cristine is left with 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9 lemons. The answer is 9.\n\nQ: Tom charges a fee of $100 a day to search for an item for the first 5 days and then $60 per day for every day after that.  How much did it cost for him to look for an item for 10 days?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe first 5 days cost 5*100=$<<5*100=500>>500\nHe gets 10-5=<<10-5=5>>5 days on discount\nHe paid 5*60=$<<5*60=300>>300 at the discounted rate\nSo in total he pays 500+300=$<<500+300=800>>800 The answer is 800.\n\nQ: James is a first-year student at a University in Chicago. He has a budget of $1000 per semester. He spends 30% of his money on food, 15% on accommodation, 25% on entertainment, and the rest on coursework materials. How much money does he spend on coursework materials?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nAccommodation is 15% * $1000=$<<15*.01*1000=150>>150\nFood is          30% * $1000=$<<30*.01*1000=300>>300\nEntertainment is   25% * $1000=$<<25*.01*1000=250>>250\nCoursework materials are thus $1000-($150+$300+$250) = $300 The answer is 300.\n\nQ: Marco has $24. Mary has $15. If Marco gives Mary half of what he has, Mary will have more than Marco. But Mary spends $5. How much more money does Mary have than Marco?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nHalf of what Marco has is $24 / 2 = $<<24/2=12>>12.\nIf he gives Mary $12, she has $12 + $15 = $<<12+15=27>>27.\nNow subtract the money Mary spends: $27 - $5 = $<<27-5=22>>22.\nNow subtract Marco's money from Mary's remaining money, $22 - $12 = $<<22-12=10>>10. The answer is 10.\n\nQ: Yvette wants to frame a new picture. When she goes to her local frame shop, she finds out that the frame she wanted is 20% more expensive than her budget of $60. If she paid for a smaller frame at 3/4 the new price of the frame she initially intended to buy, how much money did she remain with?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe frame she initially intended to buy was 20/100*$60=$<<20/100*60=12>>12 more expensive than she had thought.\nThis means the frame was being sold at $60+$12 = $<<60+12=72>>72\nIf she paid for a smaller frame at 3/4 the price of the frame she initially intended to buy, she paid 3/4*$72 = $<<3/4*72=54>>54\nYvette remained with $60-$54 = $<<60-54=6>>6 The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step."}
