To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\nQ: Daisy is climbing trees all around her neighborhood and starts to notice the number of branches and the height. The first tree she climbs is 50 feet tall and has 200 branches. The second tree she climbs is 40 feet tall and has 180 branches. The third tree she climbs is 60 feet tall and has 180 branches. The final tree she climbs is 34 feet tall and has 153 branches. On average, how many branches do these trees have per foot?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe first tree has 4 branches per foot because 200 / 50 = <<200/50=4>>4\nThe second tree tree has 4.5 branches per foot because 180 / 40 = <<180/40=4.5>>4.5\nThe third tree has 3 branches per foot because 180 / 60 = <<180/60=3>>3\nThe fourth tree has 4.5 branches per foot because 153 / 34 = <<153/34=4.5>>4.5\nThe total branches per foot is 16 because 4 + 4.5 + 3 + 4.5 = <<4+4.5+3+4.5=16>>16\nThe average branches per foot is 4 because 16 / 4 = <<16/4=4>>4 The answer is 4.\n\nQ: Mr. Maximilian is a dairy animal farmer and has 140 cows on his farm. Forty percent of the cows on his farm have a red spot, 25 percent of the cows without a red spot have a blue spot and the remaining cows do not have any spot. How many cows on the farm have no spot?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nIf Mr. Maximilian has 140 cows and 40% of them have red spots, then 40/100*140 = <<140*40/100=56>>56 cows have red spots.\nThe number of cows with no red spot is 140-56 = <<140-56=84>>84 cows.\nOut of the 84 cows without a red spot, 25% of them have a blue spot, a total of 25/100*84 = <<25/100*84=21>>21 cows.\nThe number of cows without any spot is 84-21 =<<84-21=63>>63 animals. The answer is 63.\n\nQ: Peter and Kristin are to read 20 fantasy novels each in a week. Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin. If Peter reads one book in 18 hours, how long will Kristin read half of her books?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nSince Peter reads three times as fast as Kristin, Kristin will take 18*3 = <<18*3=54>>54 hours to read one book.\nKristin reads half of her books, a total of 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 books.\nThe time Kristin will take to read half of her books is 10*54 = <<10*54=540>>540 The answer is 540.\n\nQ: Cristine bought a dozen lemons and gave 1/4 of them to her neighbor. How many lemons does Cristine have left?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nCristine bought 1 x 12 = <<1*12=12>>12 lemons.\nShe gave 12 x 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 lemons to her neighbor.\nSo, Cristine is left with 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9 lemons. The answer is 9.\n\nQ: Tom charges a fee of $100 a day to search for an item for the first 5 days and then $60 per day for every day after that.  How much did it cost for him to look for an item for 10 days?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe first 5 days cost 5*100=$<<5*100=500>>500\nHe gets 10-5=<<10-5=5>>5 days on discount\nHe paid 5*60=$<<5*60=300>>300 at the discounted rate\nSo in total he pays 500+300=$<<500+300=800>>800 The answer is 800.\n\nQ: James is a first-year student at a University in Chicago. He has a budget of $1000 per semester. He spends 30% of his money on food, 15% on accommodation, 25% on entertainment, and the rest on coursework materials. How much money does he spend on coursework materials?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nAccommodation is 15% * $1000=$<<15*.01*1000=150>>150\nFood is          30% * $1000=$<<30*.01*1000=300>>300\nEntertainment is   25% * $1000=$<<25*.01*1000=250>>250\nCoursework materials are thus $1000-($150+$300+$250) = $300 The answer is 300.\n\nQ: Marco has $24. Mary has $15. If Marco gives Mary half of what he has, Mary will have more than Marco. But Mary spends $5. How much more money does Mary have than Marco?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nHalf of what Marco has is $24 / 2 = $<<24/2=12>>12.\nIf he gives Mary $12, she has $12 + $15 = $<<12+15=27>>27.\nNow subtract the money Mary spends: $27 - $5 = $<<27-5=22>>22.\nNow subtract Marco's money from Mary's remaining money, $22 - $12 = $<<22-12=10>>10. The answer is 10.\n\nQ: Yvette wants to frame a new picture. When she goes to her local frame shop, she finds out that the frame she wanted is 20% more expensive than her budget of $60. If she paid for a smaller frame at 3/4 the new price of the frame she initially intended to buy, how much money did she remain with?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe frame she initially intended to buy was 20/100*$60=$<<20/100*60=12>>12 more expensive than she had thought.\nThis means the frame was being sold at $60+$12 = $<<60+12=72>>72\nIf she paid for a smaller frame at 3/4 the price of the frame she initially intended to buy, she paid 3/4*$72 = $<<3/4*72=54>>54\nYvette remained with $60-$54 = $<<60-54=6>>6 The answer is 6.\n\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",

If he uses 60 eggs in his recipe, calculate the total number of cups of flour and eggs that he uses altogether.\nA: Let's think step by step.\nDante needs half as many cups of flour to bake his chocolate cake as he needs eggs, meaning he needs 60/2 = <<60/2=30>>30 cups of flour for his recipe.\nAltogether, Dante needs 30+60 = <<30+60=90>>90 eggs and cups of flour for his recipe. The answer is 90.\n\nQ: Yanna bought 60 apples. She gave eighteen apples to Zenny. She gave six more apples to Andrea and kept the rest. How many apples did she keep?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nAfter giving 18 apples to Zenny, Yanna remained with 60 - 18 = <<60-18=42>>42 apples.\nSince she also gave Andrea 6 apples, Yanna remained with 42 - 6 = <<36=36>>36 apples\nTherefore, Yanna kept 36 apples. The answer is 36.\n\nQ: Betty has 20 books, and her sister has 1/4 times more books than Betty. What's the total number of books the two have?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nBetty's sister has 1/4 * 20 books = <<1/4*20=5>>5 more books.\nThe total number of books Betty's sister has is 20 books + 5 books = <<20+5=25>>25 books\nThe total number of books the two have is 25 books + 20 books = <<25+20=45>>45 books The answer is 45.\n\nQ: Bill put his french fries in the oven after it finished heating.  The recommended time was 5 minutes for them to be fully cooked.  He put them in for 45 seconds.  How many seconds remained?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nEach minute last 60 seconds, so that means for the fries to be fully cooked Bill needs to cook them for 5*60=<<5*60=300>>300 seconds\nSince Bill had the fries in the oven for 45 seconds so far, that means they need to stay in the oven for another 300-45= <<300-45=255>>255 seconds. The answer is 255.\n\nQ: Suzanna's history textbook has 160 pages and her geography textbook has 70 more pages. Her math textbook has half of the sum of the first two books' pages, and her science textbook has twice the number of pages of her history textbook. If Suzanna stacks all her textbooks on her desk, how many pages would there be in total?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nHer geography textbook has 160 + 70 = <<160+70=230>>230 pages\nThe sum of pages of her history and geography textbook is 160 + 230 = <<160+230=390>>390 pages\nHer math textbook has 390/2 = <<390/2=195>>195 pages\nHer science textbook has 160 x 2 = <<160*2=320>>320 pages\nIn total, there would be 160 + 230 + 195 + 320 = <<160+230+195+320=905>>905 pages The answer is 905.\n\nQ: Tim won a $100 raffle.  He gave away 20% to his friend.  How much did he keep?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nHe gave away 100*.2=$<<100*.2=20>>20\nSo he kept 100-20=$<<100-20=80>>80 The answer is 80.\n\nQ: On a weekend road trip, the Jensen family drove 210 miles on highways, where their car gets 35 miles for each gallon of gas and 54 miles on city streets where their car gets 18 miles for each gallon. How many gallons of gas did they use?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nOn highways, the Jensen family used 210 miles / 35 miles/gallon = <<210/35=6>>6 gallons of gas.\nOn city streets, the Jensen family used 54 miles / 18 miles/gallon = <<54/18=3>>3 gallons of gas.\nTotal, the Jensen family used 6 gallons + 3 gallons = <<6+3=9>>9 gallons of gas. The answer is 9.\n\nQ: Marcy spends 12 minutes petting her cat and 1/3 of that time combing it. How many minutes does she spend with her cat in total?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nFirst find the time Marcy spends combing the cat: 12 minutes / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 minutes\nThen add that to the time spent petting the cat to find the total time she spends with it: 4 minutes + 12 minutes = <<4+12=16>>16 minutes The answer is 16.\n\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
