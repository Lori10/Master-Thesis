If in 6 years Alice will be twice as old as Bob, how old will Alice be in 5 years? Answer Choices: (A) 19 (B) 21 (C) 23 (D) 25 (E) 27\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nA=B+10 so B=A-10.\nA+6=2(B+6).\nA+6=2(A-10+6).\nA+6=2A-8.\nA=14.\nIn 5 years, Alice will be 19 years old.\nThe answer is A. The answer is A.\n\nQ: A certain store sold pens for $0.35 each and pencils for $0.25 each. If a customer purchased both pens and pencils from the store for a total of $3.50, what total number of pens and pencils did the customer purchase? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 9 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nAnswer: Algebraically, the question looks like this: 2.5 = 0.35x + 0.25y There are six possible numbers of pens that fit that requirement:\n1 pen: $0.35\n2 pens: $0.70\n3 pens: $1.05\n4 pens: $1.40\n5 pens: $1.75 balance can fetch 7 pencils for $0.25 each. That's 5 pens and 7 pencils for a total of 12 pens and pencils. Choice (E) is correct. The answer is E.\n\nQ: Two numbers are in the ratio of 2:3 . if 4 is added in both numbers the ratio becomes 5:7. Find the difference between numbers. Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 2 (E) 10\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nWe're told that two numbers are in the ratio of 2:3. Thus, the two numbers could be...\n2 and 3\n4 and 6\n6 and 9\n8 and 12\n10 and 15\nEtc.\nWe're told that ADDING 4 to each number changes the ratio of the numbers to 5:7. We're asked for the DIFFERENCE between the original numbers.\nSince adding 4 makes the first number a multiple of 5, this limits the possibilities....\n2+4 = 6 NOT POSSIBLE\n4+4 = 8 NOT POSSIBLE\n6+4 = 10 This IS possible...Using this example, we would have...\n6 and 9, after adding 4 to each, becomes10 and 13...this is NOT a ratio of 5 to 7 though (even though it's pretty close), so we have to keep looking....\nThe next value that becomes a multiple of 5 when you add 4 to it is...16...\n16 + 4 = 20\nWith16 and 24, after adding 4 to each, we have20 and 28.This IS a ratio of 5 to 7, so we have our pair of original numbers.\nThe difference between them is 8.\nFinal Answer:\nA The answer is A.\n\nQ: If x is 50 percent greater than 88, then x = Answer Choices: (A) 68 (B) 132 (C) 86 (D) 105.6 (E) 108\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nx=88*1.5=132\nSo the answer is B. The answer is B.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",

Seven years ago, the sum of their ages was 79. Find their present ages. Answer Choices: (A) 20, 28 (B) 28, 36 (C) 35, 45 (D) 35, 55 (E) of these\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nLet their present ages be 4x, 7x and 9x years respectively.\nThen, (4x - 7) + (7x - 7) + (9x - 7) = 79\n20x = 100 => x = 5\nTheir present ages are 20, 35 and 45 years respectively.\nANSWER:C The answer is C.\n\nQ: If w is 40 percent less than q, q is 40 percent less than y, and z is 46 percent less than y, then z is greater than w by what percent of w? Answer Choices: (A) 4% (B) 18% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 50%\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nGIven w= 0.6q, q=0.6y, z=0.54y, substituting, w=2/3 Z----> z= 1.5w and thus z is 50% greater than w. E is the correct answer. The answer is E.\n\nQ: ((-1.9)(0.6) \u2013 (2.6)(1.2))/5.0 = ? Answer Choices: (A) -0.852 (B) 1.0 (C) 1.07 (D) 1.71 (E) 2.71\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nDove straight into calculation but quickly realized that the sum of two negatives is a negative so there is only one option.\n-0.852\nAnswer A The answer is A.\n\nQ: An elevator starts with 5 pasengers and stops at 8 different floors of the house. Find out the probability of all the 5 passengers alighting at different floors. Answer Choices: (A) 90 / 512 (B) 105 / 512 (C) 15/512 (D) 30/512 (E) 48/512\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nExplanation :\nProbability\n=> No. of arrangements with restriction / No. of arrangements without restriction .\n=> nPr / nr.\n=> 8P5 / 85 .\n=> 105 / 512.\nRequired probability is 105 / 512.\nAnswer : B The answer is B.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
