The only possible combinations are 8+8+1, 7+7+3, and 6+6+5.\n\nNext, we know that the sum of the squares of the digits is 109. This means that the squares of the digits must add up to 109. The only possible combinations are 8^2+8^2+1^2, 7^2+7^2+3^2, and 6^2+6^2+5^2.\n\nFinally, we know that if we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.
