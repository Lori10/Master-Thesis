On Wednesday she went to another store and bought 5 times the number of cakes she did on Tuesday. How many cakes did she buy after all three days?",
            "Pred_Rationale": "\nRose bought 4 cakes on Monday.\nOn Tuesday she bought 3 x 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 cakes.\nOn Wednesday she bought 5 x 12 = <<5*12=60>>60 cakes.\nThe total number of cakes she bought after all three days is 4 + 12 + 60 = <<4+12+60=76>>76. The answer is 76.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "\nThe pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep, so the total volume of the pool is 6 x 4 x 5 = <<6*4*5=120>>120 cubic feet.\nIt costs $.1 per cubic foot to fill, so it will cost 120 x $.1 = <<120*.1=12>>$12 to fill the pool. The answer is $12.",
