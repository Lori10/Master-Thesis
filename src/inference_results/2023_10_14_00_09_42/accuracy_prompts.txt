        "prompt": "You are an expert at arithmetic reasoning and are willing to solve algebraic word problems. Select the correct answer from the given options. If none of the options are correct, generate 'None of the above'. To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\n\nQ: A can complete a project in 20 days and B can complete the same project in 30 days. If A and B start working on the project together and A quits 15 days before the project is completed, in how many days total will the project be completed? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 21 (C) 24 (D) 27 (E) 30\n\nA: Let's think step by step. A's rate is 1/20 of the project per day. B's rate is 1/30 of the project per day. The combined rate is 1/12 of the project per day. In the last 15 days, B can do 1/2 of the project. Thus A and B must complete 1/2 of the project, which takes 6 days. The total number of days is 6 + 15 = 21. The answer is B. The answer is B.\n\nQ: A jar full of whisky contains 40% alcohol. A part of this whisky is replaced by another containg 19% alcohol and now the percentage of alcohol was found to be 22%. What quantity of whisky is replaced ? Answer Choices: (A) 1/3 (B) 2/3 (C) 2/5 (D) 3/5 (E) 4/5\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Let us assume the total original amount of whiskey = 10 ml ---> 4 ml alcohol and 6 ml non-alcohol. Let x ml be the amount removed ---> total alcohol left = 4-0.4x New quantity of whiskey added = x ml out of which 0.19 is the alcohol. Thus, the final quantity of alcohol = 4-0.4x+0.19x ----> (4-0.21x)/ 10 = 0.26 ---> x = 20/3 ml. Per the question, you need to find the x ml removed as a ratio of the initial volume ---> (20/3)/10 = 3/5. Hence, D is the correct answer. The answer is D.\n\nQ: Shawn invested one half of his savings in a bond that paid simple interest for 2 years (20% per anum) and received $600 as interest. He invested the remaining in a bond that paid compound interest, interest being compounded annually, for the same 2 years at the same rate of interest and received $655 as interest. What was the value of his total savings before investing in these two bonds? Answer Choices: (A) 3000 (B) 5000 (C) 6000 (D) 8000 (E) 9000\n\nA: Let's think step by step. So, we know that Shawn received 20% of the amount he invested in a year. We also know that in one year Shawn received $300, thud 0.2x = $300 --> x = $1,500. Since, he invested equal sums in his 2 bonds, then his total savings before investing was 2*$1,500 = $3,000. Answer: A The answer is A.\n\nQ: If the range of the set of numbers {150, 90, 125, 110, 170, 155, x, 100, 140} is 90, which of the following could be x? Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 95 (C) 110 (D) 125 (E) 140\n\nA: Let's think step by step. The range of the other 8 numbers is 170-90 = 80, so x must be either the smallest number or the largest number in the set. Then x = 170-90 = 80 or x = 90+90 = 180 The answer is A. The answer is A.\n\nQ: On Wednesday, Kramer purchases exactly 3 new shirts, 2 new sweaters, and 4 new hats, On the following day and each subsequent day thereafter, Kramer wears one of his new shirts together with one of his new sweaters and one of his new hats. Kramer avoids wearing the exact same combination of shirt, sweater, and hat for as long as possible. On which day is this no longer possible? Answer Choices: (A) Tuesday (B) Wednesday (C) Thursday (D) Friday (E) Sunday\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Shirt combinations = 3!/1*(3-1)! = 3*2*1/1*2*1 = 3 Sweater combinations = 2!/1*(2-1)! = 2*1/1*1 = 2 Hat combinations = 4!/1!*(4-1)! = 4*3*2*1/1*3*2*1 = 4 Total Combinations = Shirt Combos*Sweater Combos*Hat Combos 3*2*4=24 combinations 24 / 7 (days of the week) = remainder of 3 Purchased on Wednesday, 3rd day is Saturday. Next day, which he won't have a new combination for, is Sunday. (E) The answer is E.\n\nQ: A farmer is having a total of 20 fruits (apples or oranges). He made two type packets with these fruits. All the fruits are in either apple packets of orange packets. Apple Packets contain 3 apples each and Orange packets contain 2 oranges each.\nIf |apple packets| < 4\nThen How many packets of apples the farmer can have. When number of apple and orange packets are both positive integers above zero. Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 4 (D) 7 (E) 6\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Let us start by understand the meaning of 4 > |Number of Apples| 1) when we write |-x| this means the same as |x|. 2) Mod is very easy concept if you solve mod question by considering as a distance. when a mod is written as |x-(a)| = b, this means the distance from point 'a' (both side left and right of 'a' on number line) is b. |x-(a)| < b means the distance is between the two extreme distance(left and right side of 'a' on number line, considering the max distance is 'b' from 'a' - as per this scenario.....hence the value of 'a' must be between these two extremes. |x-(a)| > b means the distance is greater than the distance of 'b'..i.e the value of a could be anywhere more than 'b'. Now come to the question. Let number of apple packets be \u2018a\u2019 and number of oranges packets be \u2018b\u2019. First its given |a| < 4 ==> |a-0| < 4 ==> the distance from zero is less than 4. So the point \u2018a\u2019 will be -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3 as distance from 0 to these values is less than 4. Number of apple packets is above zero so possible values of \u2018a\u2019 left are 1,2,3. As per the given information there are total of 20 fruits and they are in packets (3 per packet for apples and 2 per packets for oranges) so we can write it as follows: 3a + 2b = 20 ==> b = 10 \u2013 (3*a)/2. If b is an integer then \u2018a\u2019 must be divisible by 2. If we take only those values of \u2018a\u2019 that are divisible by 2 then we are left with 2 only. So there are two packets of apples. If there are two packets of apples then b = 10 \u2013 (3*2)/2 ==> b = 7. So we have 7 packets of oranges and 2 packets of apples. So A is the answer. 7 packets (2 orange each) and 2 packets of apples (3 apples each) make 20 fruits in total. The answer is A.\n\nQ: A thief steals at a car at 4.30 p.m. and drives it at 60 km/hr. The theft is discovered at 3 p.m. and the owner sets off in another car at 75 km/hr. When will he overtake the thief? Answer Choices: (A) 1 p.m (B) 3 p.m (C) 4 p.m (D) 5 p.m (E) 7 p.m\n\nA: Let's think step by step. E 7 p.m Suppose the thief is overtaken x hrs after 4.30 p.m. Then, distance covered by the owner in (x - 1/2) hrs. 60x = 75(x - 1/2) => x = 5/2 hrs. So, the thief is overtaken at 7 p.m. The answer is E.\n\nQ: Number of ways in which the letters of word PARDENS can be arranged with vowels in alphabetical order, is Answer Choices: (A) 360 (B) 240 (C) 2520 (D) 480 (E) None of these\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Solution Order of vowels of fixed \u00e2\u02c6\u00b4 required number of ways are 7!/2!. Answer C The answer is C.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
