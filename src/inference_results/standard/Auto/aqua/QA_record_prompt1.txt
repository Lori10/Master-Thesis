        "Q": "Q: One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5",
        "Pred_Rationale": " We know that 1 gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. So, if we want to get the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to multiply 1 gram by 100/9 for vitamin E and 100/8 for vitamin A. This gives us 11.11 grams for vitamin E and 12.5 grams for vitamin A. Since we need to get at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to take the higher number, which is 12.5.
