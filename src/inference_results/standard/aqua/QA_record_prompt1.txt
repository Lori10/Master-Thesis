        "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to calculate the time it takes for Shweta to cover 15 km. Since she rides at a rate of 10 km per hour, it will take her 15/10 = 1.5 hours to cover 15 km.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total time she spends resting. She stops for 10 minutes at the end of every 15 km, so for 100 km, she will stop 100/15 = 6.67 times. Since she stops for 10 minutes each time, the total time spent resting is 6.67 * 10 = 66.67 minutes.\n\nNow, we need to convert the time spent resting from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 66.67 minutes is equal to 66.67/60 = 1.11 hours.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total time it takes for Shweta to cover 100 km. She spends 1.5 hours riding and 1.11 hours resting, so the total time is 1.5 + 1.11 = 2.61 hours.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) 13 hours.",

We are given that Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours.\n\nNext, we are told that Jack finishes two-thirds of the work. This means that there is one-third of the work remaining for Jill to do.\n\nWe are also given that Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. This means that Jill takes 20 times longer than Jack to clean the same amount of work.\n\nSince Jill takes 20 times longer than Jack, it will take her 20 times longer to finish the remaining one-third of the work.\n\nSo, the time it takes Jill to finish the remaining work is 20 * (1/3) = 20/3 hours.\n\nTherefore, the answer is not listed in the answer choices.",
