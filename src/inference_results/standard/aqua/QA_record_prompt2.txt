Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5\nA:",
        "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to determine the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.

        "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find out how many times Shweta will stop for rest during the 100 km journey. To do this, we divide 100 km by 15 km (the distance she travels before each rest). \n\n100 km / 15 km = 6.67\n\nSince she cannot stop for rest 0.67 times, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, she will stop for rest 7 times during the journey.\n\nNow, let's calculate the time it takes for Shweta to travel 100 km. \n\nShe rides at a rate of 10 km per hour, so she will spend 100 km / 10 km per hour = 10 hours riding.\n\nShe also stops for 10 minutes at the end of every 15 km. Since she stops 7 times, she will spend 7 * 10 minutes = 70 minutes resting.\n\nTo convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 70 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 1.17 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total time it takes for Shweta to cover 100 km is 10 hours + 1.17 hours = 11.17 hours.\n\nSince the answer choices are given in whole numbers, we round up to the nearest whole number.\n\nTherefore, Shweta will take 11 hours to cover 100 km. \n\nThe correct answer is (C) 11 hours.",

Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20\nA:",
        "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find out how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht by himself. We are given that Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the yacht per hour.\n\nNext, we are told that Jack finishes two-thirds of the work. This means that he completes 2/3 of the yacht in the time it takes him to clean the entire yacht. To find out how long it takes him to finish two-thirds of the work, we can set up the equation:\n\n(2/3) = (1/12) * t\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2/3 = 1/12 * t\n2/3 = t/12\nt = 8\n\nSo it takes Jack 8 hours to finish two-thirds of the work.\n\nNow we need to find out how long it takes Jill to finish the remaining one-third of the work. We are told that Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. This means that Jill's rate of cleaning is 1/20 of the yacht per hour.\n\nTo find out how long it takes Jill to finish one-third of the work, we can set up the equation:\n\n(1/3) = (1/20) * t\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n1/3 = 1/20 * t\n1/3 = t/20\nt = 20/3\n\nSo it takes Jill approximately 6.67 hours (or 6 hours and 40 minutes) to finish the remaining one-third of the work.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) 20.",

        "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the total work done by the 8 men in 6 days. Since they work together, we can multiply the number of men by the number of days to get the total work done. So, 8 men * 6 days = 48 man-days of work.\n\nNext, we need to find how many men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day. Since the work is the same, we can set up a proportion to solve for the number of men. Let's call the number of men required as \"x\". The proportion would be:\n\n8 men / 48 man-days = x men / 1/2 day\n\nTo solve for x, we can cross multiply:\n\n8 * 1/2 = 48 * x\n\n4 = 48x\n\nDividing both sides by 48, we get:\n\nx = 4/48 = 1/12\n\nSo, 1/12 of a man is required to complete the work in 1/2 day. Since we can't have a fraction of a man, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the answer is 1 man.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 1 man.",

        "Q": "An organization decided to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contribution from each of its employees. If each of them had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. How many employees are there in that organization? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 200 (C) 400 (D) 100 (E) 500\nA:",
        "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume there are x employees in the organization.\n\nIf each employee contributes an equal amount, then the total contribution would be 6 lakh. So, each employee contributes 6 lakh / x.\n\nIf each employee contributes Rs. 60 extra, then the total contribution would be 6.24 lakh. So, each employee contributes (6.24 lakh / x) + 60.\n\nAccording to the given information, we can set up the equation:\n\n6 lakh / x = (6.24 lakh / x) + 60\n\nTo solve this equation, we can multiply both sides by x to get rid of the denominators:\n\n6 lakh = 6.24 lakh + 60x\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation:\n\n0.24 lakh = 60x\n\nDivide both sides by 0.24 lakh:\n\nx = 60 / 0.24\n\nx = 250\n\nTherefore, there are 250 employees in the organization.",

        "Q": "Last year, a Home Appliance Store sold an average(arithmetic mean) of 42 microwave ovens per month. In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 30 (C) 31 (D) 32 (E) None of the above\nA:",
        "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months of this year. Since the average is 20 per month, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months is 20 * 10 = 200.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of microwave ovens sold in the previous year. Since the average is 42 per month, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the previous year is 42 * 12 = 504.\n\nFinally, we need to find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period. To do this, we add the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months to the total number of microwave ovens sold in the previous year, and then divide by the total number of months (22).\n\n(200 + 504) / 22 = 704 / 22 = 32\n\nTherefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period is 32. The answer is (D) 32.",
