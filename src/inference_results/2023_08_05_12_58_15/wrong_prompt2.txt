{'prompt': "You are an expert at arithmetic reasoning and are willing to solve algebraic word problems. To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\nQ: TOM traveled the entire 50 miles trip. If he did the first 15 miles of at a constant rate 20 miles per hour and the remaining trip of at a constant rate 45 miles per hour, what is the his average speed, in miles per hour? Answer Choices: (A) 60.40mph (B) 60.20mph (C) 55.32mph (D) 65.50mph (E) 70.25mph\nA: Let's think step by step.\navg speed = total distance/ total time = (d1+d2)/(t1+t2) = (15+35) / ((15/20)+(35/45)) = 50*180/149 = 60.40mph\nA The answer is A.\n\nQ: A certain high school has 500 students. Of these students, 20 are taking music, 20 are taking art, and 10 are taking both music and art. How many students are taking neither music nor art? Answer Choices: (A) 430 (B) 440 (C) 450 (D) 460 (E) 470\nA: Let's think step by step.\nWe're given a series of facts to work with:\n1) A certain high school has 500 students.\n2) Of these students:\nX are taking music,\nY are taking art, and\nZ are taking BOTH music and art.\nWe're asked how many students are taking NEITHER music nor art?\nLet's TEST\nX = 20\nY = 20\nZ = 10\nSo, we have 20 students taking music, 20 taking art and 10 taking BOTH music and art. That 10 person has been counted TWICE though (once in the music 'group' and once in the art 'group'), so what we really have is...\n10 student taking JUST music\n10 student taking JUST art\n10 student taking BOTH music and art\nTotal = 30 students\nWe're asked for the total number of students who are taking NEITHER Course. That is 5000 - 30 = 470.\nE The answer is E.\n\nQ: if cost of an apple is equal to cost of 4 oranges and he has 100$ with him. Cost of an orange is 1$. He want to buy same number of orange and apples. So how many apple and orange he would be able to buy in 100$? Answer Choices: (A) 10 apple an 10 oranges (B) 20 apple and 20 oranges (C) 27 apples and 27 oranges (D) 30 apple and 30 oranges (E) 34 apples and 34 oranges\nA: Let's think step by step.\nSince cost of an orange is 1$ and apple is 4 times costlier than orange so the cost of apple is 4$. Now if we add cost of an apple and orange it comes to be 5$ and hence if we divide 100 by 5 we get answer 20. So he will be able to buy 20 apple and 20 oranges. So option B is correct. The answer is B.\n\nQ: If one positive integer is greater than another positive integer by 4, and the difference of their cubes is 208, what is their sum? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 10 (C) 12 (D) 14 (E) 16\nA: Let's think step by step.\n1^3 = 1\n2^3 = 8\n3^3 = 27\n4^3 = 64\n5^3 = 125\n6^3 = 216\nThe two numbers are 2 and 6.\nThe answer is A. The answer is A.\n\nQ: From a group of 3 boys and 3 girls, 4 children are to be randomly selected. What is the probability that equal numbers of boys and girls will be selected? Answer Choices: (A) 1/10 (B) 4/9 (C) 1/2 (D) 3/5 (E) 2/3\nA: Let's think step by step.\nprob reqd= 1- probab of not having eq numbers\nprob of not having eq no's is = prob of having 3 Boys and 1 girl or prob of having 3 girls and 1 boy\n=(1* 3/15) +(3/15 * 1)=2/5\nreqd prob= 1-2/5=3/5\nAnswer:D The answer is D.\n\nQ: Anand and Deepak started a business investing Rs. 25,000 and Rs. 35,000 respectively. Out of a total profit of Rs. 13,800, Deepak's share is? Answer Choices: (A) 2777 (B) 2888 (C) 8050 (D) 2882 (E) 2781\nA: Let's think step by step.\nRatio of their shares = 25000 : 35000 = 5:7\nDeepak's share = 13800 * 7/12 = Rs. 8050.\nAnswer: C The answer is C.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step."}
