Then, \n\nC.I. = P(1 + r/100)^2 - P = P[(1 + r/100)^2 - 1]\n\nS.I. = P*r*2/100 = P*r/50\n\nGiven, C.I. - S.I. = Rs. 72 and P = Rs. 5000\n\n5000[(1 + r/100)^2 - 1] - 5000*r/50 = 72\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n(1 + r/100)^2 - 1 - r/100 = 72/5000\n\n(1 + r/100)^2 - r/100 - 721/5000 = 0\n\nLet (1 + r/100) = x\n\nThen, x^2 - x - 721/5000 = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we get:\n\nx = 1.08 or x = -0.68\n\nSince the rate of interest cannot be negative, we take x = 1.08\n\nTherefore, (1 + r/100) = 1.08\n\nr/100 = 0.08\n\nr = 8%\n\nHence, the rate of interest is 8%.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can use the formula for average speed, which is:\n\naverage speed = total distance / total time\n\nSince the plane flies along the four sides of a square, the total distance it covers is the perimeter of the square, which is 4 times the length of one side. Let's call the length of one side \"s\". Then:\n\ntotal distance = 4s\n\nTo find the total time, we need to find the time it takes to fly each side. We can use the formula:\n\ntime = distance / speed\n\nFor the first side, the distance is \"s\" and the speed is 200 km/hr, so:\n\ntime for first side = s / 200\n\nFor the second side, the distance is also \"s\" and the speed is 400 km/hr, so:\n\ntime for second side = s / 400\n\nFor the third side, the distance is again \"s\" and the speed is 600 km/hr, so:\n\ntime for third side = s / 600\n\nFor the fourth side, the distance is still \"s\" and the speed is 800 km/hr, so:\n\ntime for fourth side = s / 800\n\nThe total time is the sum of these four times:\n\ntotal time = s/200 + s/400 + s/600 + s/800\n\nWe can simplify this expression by finding a common denominator:\n\ntotal time = (6s + 3s + 2s + 1.5s) / (2400)\n\ntotal time = 12.5s / 2400\n\nNow we can substitute the expressions for total distance and total time into the formula for average speed:\n\naverage speed = (4s) / (12.5s / 2400)\n\naverage speed = (4s) * (2400 / 12.5s)\n\naverage speed = 768000 / s\n\nWe don't know the length of one side of the square, but we can see that the average speed is inversely proportional to the length of the side. That is, if we double the length of the side, the average speed will be halved. Therefore, we can choose any convenient value for the length of the side, and the answer will be proportional to that value. Let's choose s = 10 km. Then:\n\naverage speed = 768000 / 10\n\naverage speed = 76800 km/hr\n\nThis is not one of the answer choices, but we can see that it is closest to answer choice B, 562 km/hr.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that there are 100 students in total at Daifu university. Then, 24 students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. Let's call the number of students who are only members of the swim team \"x\". Then, the number of students who are members of the swim team (including those who are also members of the chess club) is (x + 24). \n\nWe know that 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club. This means that 80% of members of the swim team are members of both the swim team and the chess club. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\n0.8(x + 24) = x\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n0.8x + 19.2 = x\n\n0.2x = 19.2\n\nx = 96\n\nSo, there are 96 students who are only members of the swim team, and there are 24 students who are members of both the swim team and the chess club. Therefore, the total number of students who are members of the swim team is (96 + 24) = 120. \n\nFinally, we can calculate the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team:\n\n120/100 * 100% = 120%\n\nThis answer doesn't make sense, so we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work. \n\nWe made a mistake in assuming that there are 100 students in total at Daifu university. We don't actually know the total number of students, so we can't calculate percentages based on that assumption. \n\nInstead, let's use \"T\" to represent the total number of students. Then, we know that 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team, so:\n\n0.24T = number of students who are members of both a chess club and a swim team\n\nWe also know that 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club. Let's call the number of students who are members of the swim team (including those who are also members of the chess club) \"S\". Then, we can set up the following equation:\n\n0.2S = number of students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club\n\nS - 0.2S = 0.8S = number of students who are members of both the swim team and the chess club\n\nWe want to find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team, which is:\n\n(S/ T) * 100%\n\nSubstituting in the values we know, we get:\n\n(S/ T) * 100% = [(0.8S + 0.24T)/ T] * 100%\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(S/ T) * 100% = (0.8S/ T + 0.24) * 100%\n\nWe don't know the values of S or T, so we can't calculate the exact percentage. However, we can see that the answer must be less than 100%, since it is impossible for more than 100% of students to be members of the swim team. \n\nTherefore, the answer is None of the above.",

What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 81 (C) 90 (D) 99 (E) 110",
            "Pred_Rationale": "We can use the formula: \n\nn(A or B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A and B)\n\nLet x be the number of students who attended the prom night and the debating session. Then, we know that:\n\nn(prom) >= 0.45(200) = 90\nn(debate) >= 0.35(200) = 70\n\nWe want to find the maximum number of students who did not attend either event, which is the complement of the number of students who attended at least one event. So, we want to find:\n\nn(neither) = 200 - n(prom or debate)\n\nUsing the formula above, we have:\n\nn(prom or debate) = n(prom) + n(debate) - x\n\nWe want to maximize n(neither), which means we want to minimize n(prom or debate). So, we want to minimize x. \n\nTo minimize x, we can assume that all 90 students who attended the prom night also attended the debating session. Then, we have:\n\nn(prom or debate) = n(prom) + n(debate) - x\nn(prom or debate) = 90 + 70 - 90\nn(prom or debate) = 70\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is:\n\nn(neither) = 200 - n(prom or debate)\nn(neither) = 200 - 70\nn(neither) = 130\n\nThe answer is 130, which is not one of the answer choices. However, we can see that the minimum number of students who attended at least one event is 90 + 70 - x = 70, which means x >= 50. This gives us a maximum value of n(neither) = 200 - 70 = 130, which is the closest answer choice. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 99.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can start by finding the shuttle's vertical speed: \n\nVertical speed = distance/time = 700/40 = 17.5 m/s \n\nWe can then use this speed to find the distance traveled during the 5 seconds it takes to pass a point: \n\nDistance = speed x time = 17.5 x 5 = 87.5 m \n\nFinally, we can add the length of the shuttle to this distance to get the total length: \n\nTotal length = distance + length = 87.5 + length \n\nWe don't have enough information to find the length of the shuttle directly, but we do know that the answer must be one of the given options. We can try each option in turn and see which one gives a total length of 87.5 m: \n\n- Option A: 87.5 - 50 = 37.5 (not a possible length) \n- Option B: 87.5 - 75 = 12.5 (not a possible length) \n- Option C: 87.5 - 100 = -12.5 (not a possible length) \n- Option D: 87.5 - 125 = -37.5 (not a possible length) \n- Option E: 87.5 - 150 = -62.5 (not a possible length) \n\nTherefore, none of the given options are correct.

Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume the wholesale cost of the appliance to be $100. \n\nThen, the original retail price would be $100 + 60% of $100 = $160. \n\nThe appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, which is 20% of $160 = $32 less. \n\nTherefore, the selling price of the appliance = $160 - $32 = $128. \n\nNow, we need to find what percent more than its wholesale cost was the selling price. \n\nThe selling price is $28 more than the wholesale cost of $100. \n\nSo, the required percentage = (28/100) * 100% = 28%. \n\nHence, the answer is (B) 28%.",
