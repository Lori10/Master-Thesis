            "Pred_Rationale": "We can use the formula for compound interest to solve this problem. The formula is:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\nA = the amount of money at the end of the investment\nP = the principal amount (the initial investment)\nr = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)\nn = the number of times the interest is compounded per year\nt = the time (in years) of the investment\n\nFor simple interest, the formula is:\n\nA = P(1 + rt)\n\nWhere:\nA = the amount of money at the end of the investment\nP = the principal amount (the initial investment)\nr = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)\nt = the time (in years) of the investment\n\nLet's use these formulas to solve the problem:\n\nThe difference between simple interest and compound interest for Rs. 5000 for 2 years is Rs. 72. This means that the compound interest is greater than the simple interest by Rs. 72.\n\nLet's assume that the annual interest rate is r. Then, we can write:\n\nCompound interest = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) - P\nSimple interest = Prt\n\nWe know that the difference between the two is Rs. 72, so we can write:\n\nP(1 + r/n)^(nt) - P - Prt = 72\n\nWe can simplify this equation by factoring out P:\n\nP[(1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1 - rt] = 72\n\nWe know that P = Rs. 5000, n = 1 (since the interest is compounded annually), and t = 2. Substituting these values, we get:\n\n5000[(1 + r/1)^(1*2) - 1 - 2r] = 72\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n5000[(1 + r)^2 - 1 - 2r] = 72\n\nExpanding the square, we get:\n\n5000[1 + 2r + r^2 - 1 - 2r] = 72\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n5000r^2 = 72\n\nDividing both sides by 5000, we get:\n\nr^2 = 0.0144\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\nr = 0.12\n\nTherefore, the annual interest rate is 12%.\n\nThe answer is B.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can solve this problem by using combinations. We need to find the number of ways to select 3 candy bars from the 11 candy bars such that the total cost is more than $4. We can break this down into cases based on the cost of the candy bars selected.\n\nCase 1: Select all three candy bars that cost $2 each.\nThere are 4 candy bars that cost $2 each, so there are 4C3 = 4 ways to select all three of them. The total cost would be $6.\n\nCase 2: Select two candy bars that cost $2 each and one candy bar that costs $1.\nThere are 4 candy bars that cost $2 each and 4 candy bars that cost $1 each, so there are 4C2 * 4C1 = 24 ways to select two $2 candy bars and one $1 candy bar. The total cost would be $5.\n\nCase 3: Select one candy bar that costs $2, one candy bar that costs $1, and one candy bar that costs $0.50.\nThere are 4 candy bars that cost $2 each, 4 candy bars that cost $1 each, and 3 candy bars that cost $0.50 each, so there are 4C1 * 4C1 * 3C1 = 48 ways to select one candy bar from each price group. The total cost would be $3.50.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 4 + 24 + 48 = 76 ways to select 3 candy bars from the 11 candy bars such that the total cost is more than $4. However, we need to subtract the number of ways to select 3 candy bars such that the total cost is exactly $4 or less. We can only do this by selecting three candy bars that cost $0.50 each, which can be done in 3C3 = 1 way, or by selecting two candy bars that cost $2 each and one candy bar that costs $0.50, which can be done in 4C2 * 3C1 = 18 ways. Therefore, there are 1 + 18 = 19 ways to select 3 candy bars such that the total cost is $4 or less.\n\nThe final answer is 76 - 19 = 57 ways to select 3 candy bars from the 11 candy bars such that the total cost is more than $4.\n\nThe answer is None of the above.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can use the formula for average speed, which is:\n\naverage speed = total distance / total time\n\nSince the plane flies along the four sides of a square, each side has the same length, let's call it \"d\". The total distance around the square is then 4d.\n\nTo find the total time, we need to find the time it takes to fly each side. We can use the formula:\n\ntime = distance / speed\n\nFor the first side, the distance is d and the speed is 200 km/hr, so the time is d/200. Similarly, the times for the other sides are d/400, d/600, and d/800.\n\nThe total time is then:\n\ntotal time = d/200 + d/400 + d/600 + d/800\n\nWe can simplify this by finding a common denominator:\n\ntotal time = (12d + 6d + 4d + 3d) / (2400)\n\ntotal time = 25d / 2400\n\nNow we can plug in the values for total distance and total time into the formula for average speed:\n\naverage speed = (4d) / (25d / 2400)\n\naverage speed = (4d) * (2400 / 25d)\n\naverage speed = 38400 / d\n\nWe don't know the value of \"d\", but we can see that the average speed is inversely proportional to the length of the side of the square. In other words, if we double the length of the side, the average speed will be halved. Therefore, we can choose any convenient value for \"d\" and still get the same ratio of average speeds.\n\nFor example, let's say the side length is 1 km. Then the total distance around the square is 4 km, and the total time is:\n\ntotal time = (1/200) + (1/400) + (1/600) + (1/800)\n\ntotal time = 0.01625 hours\n\nPlugging this into the formula for average speed, we get:\n\naverage speed = 38400 / 1\n\naverage speed = 38400 km/hr\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's call the side of the original square piece of cloth \"x\". When we trim 4 feet from one edge, we are left with a rectangle that is x by x-4. \n\nWe are told that this rectangle is cut in half diagonally to form two triangles, each with an area of 70 square feet. The area of a triangle is 1/2 base times height, so we can set up an equation:\n\n1/2 (x)(x-4)/2 = 70\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx(x-4)/4 = 70\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4, we get:\n\nx(x-4) = 280\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\nx^2 - 4x = 280\n\nRearranging this equation, we get:\n\nx^2 - 4x - 280 = 0\n\nWe can solve for x using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))/2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -4, and c = -280, so:\n\nx = (-(-4) \u00b1 sqrt((-4)^2 - 4(1)(-280)))/2(1)\n\nx = (4 \u00b1 sqrt(1136))/2\n\nx = (4 \u00b1 8sqrt(71))/2\n\nx = 2 \u00b1 4sqrt(71)\n\nSince x is the length of a side of the original square piece of cloth, the perimeter of the original piece is 4x. So:\n\nPerimeter = 4(2 \u00b1 4sqrt(71))\n\nPerimeter = 8 \u00b1 16sqrt(71)\n\nThe answer choices are not in this form, so we need to simplify further. We can use a calculator to approximate the value of 8 + 16sqrt(71):\n\n8 + 16sqrt(71) \u2248 62.3\n\nAnd we can use a calculator to approximate the value of 8 - 16sqrt(71):\n\n8 - 16sqrt(71) \u2248 -46.3\n\nSince a perimeter cannot be negative, we can discard the negative solution and conclude that the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth was approximately 62.3 feet.\n\nFinal Answer:\nD The answer is D.",

Since there could be some students who took both physics and math, we know that the total number of students who took physics or math is greater than 20% + 28% = 48% of n.\nSo, we have:\n0.48n < the number of students who took physics or math\nWe also know that the number of students who took physics or math is less than or equal to the total number of students in the school, which is n.\nSo, we have:\nthe number of students who took physics or math <= n\nCombining these two inequalities, we get:\n0.48n < the number of students who took physics or math <= n\nNow, we can try to find the smallest possible value of n that satisfies this inequality. Let's start with the smallest answer choice:\n(A) 550\n0.48(550) = 264\nThis means that the number of students who took physics or math must be greater than 264.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The merchant can take a discount of 4% if he pays within 30 days. If he doesn't pay within 30 days, he must pay the full amount within n days. We want to find the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money to take advantage of the discount. \n\nIf he takes the discount, he will pay 96% of the invoice amount, which is:\n\n0.96 * $20,000 = $19,200\n\nIf he doesn't take the discount, he will pay the full amount of $20,000. \n\nLet's say he borrows the money for x days at an interest rate of r. Then he will have to pay back:\n\n$19,200 = $20,000 * (1 - 0.04) = $20,000 * 0.96\n\n$20,000 = $20,000 * (1 + r * (x/365))\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n1 + r * (x/365) = 19,200/20,000\n\n1 + r * (x/365) = 0.96\n\nr * (x/365) = -0.04\n\nr = (-0.04 * 365)/x\n\nWe want to find the highest value of r that satisfies this equation. The highest value of r will occur when x is the smallest possible value. \n\nThe smallest possible value of x is 31 (30 days for the discount plus 1 day to pay the loan back). \n\nSubstituting x = 31, we get:\n\nr = (-0.04 * 365)/31\n\nr = -0.471\n\nThe highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money is 47.1%. \n\nHowever, none of the answer choices match this value, so the answer is None of the above.",

Similarly, it would take him 17+(t+4) = t+21 hours to return by car. \n\nTherefore, the total time it would take him to travel both ways by car is (t+4) + (t+21) = 2t + 25 hours. \n\nWe don't know the value of t, but we can use the fact that he takes 17 hours to go by train to solve for it. \n\nIf he takes t hours to travel to the city by train, then it takes him t hours to return by train as well.

Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours",
            "Pred_Rationale": "We can start by finding the relative speed of the two cars:\nRelative speed = Speed of car 1 - Speed of car 2\nRelative speed = 55 - 52\nRelative speed = 3 mph\nThis means that the distance between the two cars is decreasing at a rate of 3 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes for the distance to be 15 miles, we can set up the following equation:\n15 = 3t\nWhere t is the time in hours.

In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 28 (C) 30 (D) 53 (E) 59",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's start by finding out how many times the number of water lilies doubles to reach the final number of lilies. If there is one lily initially and it doubles every two days, then after 2 days there will be 2 lilies, after 4 days there will be 4 lilies, after 6 days there will be 8 lilies, and so on. We can see that the number of lilies doubles every 2 days, so after 60 days there will be 2^(60/2) = 2^30 lilies on the lake.\n\nNow, let's find out how many days it will take for the lake to be fully covered with lilies if there are initially 64 lilies. We can use the same logic as before, but instead of starting with 1 lily, we start with 64 lilies. After 2 days there will be 128 lilies, after 4 days there will be 256 lilies, after 6 days there will be 512 lilies, and so on. We want to find out how many days it will take for the number of lilies to reach 2^30.\n\nWe can set up an equation to solve for the number of days:\n64 * 2^(d/2) = 2^30\nDividing both sides by 64, we get:\n2^(d/2) = 2^25\nTaking the logarithm of both sides, we get:\nd/2 = 25\nd = 50\n\nTherefore, it will take 50 days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies if there are initially 64 lilies.\n\nFinal Answer:\nD.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We are given that the perimeter of the rectangular plot is 340 meters. Let's assume that the length of the rectangular plot is l and the breadth is b. Then we have:\n\n2(l + b) = 340\nl + b = 170\n\nWe need to find the cost of gardening a 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot. This means that we need to increase the length and breadth of the rectangular plot by 2 meters each (1 meter on each side). So, the new length and breadth will be (l + 2) and (b + 2) respectively. \n\nThe area of the rectangular plot with the boundary will be:\n\n(l + 2)(b + 2) - lb\n= lb + 2l + 2b + 4 - lb\n= 2l + 2b + 4\n\nThe cost of gardening 1 square meter is given as $10. Therefore, the cost of gardening the entire area will be:\n\n10(2l + 2b + 4)\n= 20(l + b + 2)\n= 20(170 + 2)\n= 20(172)\n= $3440\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 3440.",

The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5(\u221a3 + 1)  (B) 6(\u221a3 + \u221a2)  (C) 7(\u221a3 \u2013 1)  (D) 8(\u221a3 \u2013 2)  (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the height of the tower be h and the distance of the car from the base of the tower be d. Then, we have two right triangles, one with angle of elevation 45 degrees and the other with angle of elevation 60 degrees. We can set up the following system of equations:\n\nh/d = tan(45) = 1\n(h+x)/d = tan(60) = sqrt(3)\n\nwhere x is the distance the car travels after the angle of elevation changes from 45 to 60 degrees. Solving for h and d in terms of x, we get:\n\nh = sqrt(3)x\nd = x/sqrt(3)\n\nSubstituting these into the first equation, we get:\n\nsqrt(3)x / (x/sqrt(3)) = 1\n3x^2 = x^2/3\nx^2 = 3/4\nx = sqrt(3)/2\n\nSo the car travels a distance of sqrt(3)/2 after the angle of elevation changes from 45 to 60 degrees. To find the total distance the car travels, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nd^2 + h^2 = (d+x)^2\n(x/sqrt(3))^2 + (sqrt(3)x)^2 = (d+x)^2\n4x^2/3 + 3x^2 = (d+x)^2\nd+x = sqrt(7)x/3\n\nThe time it takes for the car to travel this distance at a uniform speed is proportional to the distance, so we can set up the following proportion:\n\nsqrt(3)/2 / t = (sqrt(7)/3)x / (t+t1)\n\nwhere t1 is the additional time it takes for the car to travel the remaining distance to the base of the tower. Solving for t1, we get:\n\nt1 = 3t(sqrt(7)/3 - sqrt(3)/2) / sqrt(7)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nt1 = t(3sqrt(7) - 6)/2sqrt(7)\n\nSo the answer is (E) None of these, since none of the answer choices match this expression.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's first find the amount of zinc and copper in alloy X and Y separately.\n\nIn alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. This means that for every 2 parts of zinc, there are 3 parts of copper. So, if we have 6x grams of alloy X, we have 2x grams of zinc and 3x grams of copper.\n\nSimilarly, in alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which simplifies to 2:3. This means that for every 2 parts of zinc, there are 3 parts of copper. So, if we have 7y grams of alloy Y, we have 2y grams of zinc and 3y grams of copper.\n\nNow, we can find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z by adding the amounts from alloy X and Y.\n\nTotal zinc = 2x + 2y = 2(x + y)\nTotal copper = 3x + 3y = 3(x + y)\n\nWe are given that we have 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y, so the total amount of alloy Z is 40 + 60 = 100 grams.\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z by dividing the total amount of zinc by the total amount of copper.\n\nTotal zinc : Total copper = 2(x + y) : 3(x + y) = 2:3\n\nSo, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 2:3.\n\nFinal Answer:\nC) 59:90",

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can start by using algebra to solve the problem. Let's let the breadth of the rectangle be \"b\". Then we know that the length is 4 times the breadth plus 1, or 4b + 1. We also know that the area of the rectangle is 150 square meters. So we can set up an equation:\n\nb(4b + 1) = 150\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\n4b^2 + b = 150\n\nRearranging and setting equal to zero, we get:\n\n4b^2 + b - 150 = 0\n\nWe can factor this quadratic equation:\n\n(4b - 15)(b + 10) = 0\n\nSo either 4b - 15 = 0 or b + 10 = 0. The second solution doesn't make sense, since the breadth of the rectangle can't be negative. So we solve for b in the first equation:\n\n4b - 15 = 0\n4b = 15\nb = 3.75\n\nSo the breadth of the rectangle is 3.75 meters. The length is 4 times this plus 1, or 16 meters. The perimeter is twice the length plus twice the breadth:\n\n2(16) + 2(3.75) = 32 + 7.5 = 39.5\n\nSo the perimeter is 39.5 meters, which is closest to answer choice (B) 61 m.",

Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The volume of the coin is the volume of a cylinder with height 2mm and radius 7.5mm. So the volume of the coin is pi*(7.5mm)^2*(2mm) = 352.5mm^3.\nLet the weight of aluminum in the coin be x grams. Then the weight of silver in the coin is 2x grams. Since the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, we have:\ndensity of aluminum * volume of aluminum * weight of aluminum = density of silver * volume of silver * weight of silver\n2.7 g/cm^3 * x * 352.5mm^3 * x = 5.4 g/cm^3 * (352.5mm^3 - x * 352.5mm^3) * 2x\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\nx^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\n(x - 1)^2 = 0\nx = 1\nSo the weight of aluminum in the coin is 1 gram, and the weight of silver in the coin is 2 grams. Therefore, the weight of the coin is 3 grams. Since the coin is made of equal volumes of aluminum and silver, the density of the alloy is the average of the densities of aluminum and silver, which is (2.7 g/cm^3 + 5.4 g/cm^3)/2 = 4.05 g/cm^3. The volume of the aluminum coin is pi*(15mm/2)^2*(1mm) = 176.625mm^3. Therefore, the weight of the aluminum coin is:\ndensity of aluminum * volume of aluminum = 2.7 g/cm^3 * 176.625mm^3 = 477.1875 g = 47.72 grams (rounded to two decimal places).\nThe answer is None of the above.",
