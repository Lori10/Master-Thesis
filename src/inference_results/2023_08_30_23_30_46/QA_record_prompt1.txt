Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find out how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht. We know that he can clean it in 12 hours, so we can set up the equation:\n\n1 yacht / 12 hours = Jack's rate of cleaning\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it takes Jack to clean two-thirds of the yacht. We can set up another equation:\n\n2/3 yacht / x hours = Jack's rate of cleaning\n\nWe don't know x yet, but we can solve for it by setting the two rates of cleaning equal to each other:\n\n1 yacht / 12 hours = 2/3 yacht / x hours\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\nx = 8 hours\n\nSo Jack takes 8 hours to clean two-thirds of the yacht. That means there is one-third of the yacht left to clean.\n\nNow we need to find out how long it takes Jill to clean one-third of the yacht. We know that her rate of cleaning is 5% of what Jack can do, so we can set up the equation:\n\n1/20 * Jack's rate of cleaning = Jill's rate of cleaning\n\nWe already know Jack's rate of cleaning (1 yacht / 12 hours), so we can substitute that in:\n\n1/20 * 1 yacht / 12 hours = Jill's rate of cleaning\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n1 yacht / 240 hours = Jill's rate of cleaning\n\nFinally, we can set up the last equation to find out how long it takes Jill to clean one-third of the yacht:\n\n1/3 yacht / y hours = Jill's rate of cleaning\n\nSubstituting in Jill's rate of cleaning, we get:\n\n1/3 yacht / y hours = 1 yacht / 240 hours\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\ny = 80 hours\n\nSo it takes Jill 80 hours to clean one-third of the yacht.

Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find out how many pens the company needs to manufacture in order to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler. Since 10% of the produced pens are always defective, the company needs to produce more than 7200 pens to account for the defective ones. \n\nLet's use x to represent the total number of pens the company needs to manufacture. Then, we can set up the following equation:\n\nx - 0.1x = 7200\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n0.9x = 7200\n\nx = 8000\n\nSo, the company needs to manufacture 8000 pens in order to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler.\n\nNext, we need to find out the overall profit on all the manufactured pens. The question tells us that the estimated profit is 25%. Let's use C to represent the manufactured cost of each pen. Then, we can set up the following equation:\n\n0.25(C*x) = 7200*10\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n0.25Cx = 72000\n\nCx = 72000/0.25\n\nCx = 288000\n\nSo, the manufactured cost of each pen is Rs. 36.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the manufactured cost of each pen before the defective ones are removed.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's break down the problem. \n\nWe need to find the probability that a number chosen from the set S is relatively prime to 1,000. \n\nTo do this, we need to find the number of integers in S that are relatively prime to 1,000 and divide it by the total number of integers in S. \n\nLet's start by finding the number of integers in S that are relatively prime to 1,000. \n\nWe know that 1 is relatively prime to all numbers, so we can exclude it from our count. \n\nWe also know that any even number is not relatively prime to 1,000 since they share a common factor of 2. \n\nTherefore, we only need to consider the odd numbers in S. \n\nTo find the number of odd numbers in S, we can divide the total number of integers in S by 2 since half of them will be odd. \n\nSo, the number of odd integers in S is 1,000/2 = 500. \n\nNow, we need to find how many of these odd integers are relatively prime to 1,000. \n\nTo do this, we can use Euler's totient function, which gives us the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. \n\nThe formula for Euler's totient function is: \n\n\u03c6(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere n is the number we want to find the totient of, and p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n. \n\nIn this case, we want to find \u03c6(1,000). \n\nThe prime factorization of 1,000 is 2^3 * 5^3. \n\nSo, \n\n\u03c6(1,000) = 1,000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5) \n\n\u03c6(1,000) = 400 \n\nTherefore, there are 400 odd integers in S that are relatively prime to 1,000. \n\nFinally, we can find the probability by dividing the number of odd integers that are relatively prime to 1,000 by the total number of integers in S: \n\nP = 400/1,000 \n\nP = 2/5 \n\nSo, the answer is (D) 2/5.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we can use the formula for batting average: \n\nBatting average = Total runs scored / Number of innings played \n\nWe know that Sachin's current batting average is 51, so we can set up an equation: \n\n51 = Total runs scored / Number of innings played \n\nNext, we know that in the finals, Sachin scored 78 runs and his new batting average is 54. We can set up another equation using the same formula: \n\n54 = (Total runs scored + 78) / (Number of innings played + 1) \n\nWe can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by (Number of innings played + 1): \n\n54(Number of innings played + 1) = Total runs scored + 78 \n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (Total runs scored and Number of innings played). We can solve for one variable in one equation and substitute it into the other equation. \n\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for Total runs scored: \n\nTotal runs scored = 51(Number of innings played) \n\nSubstituting this into the second equation: \n\n54(Number of innings played + 1) = 51(Number of innings played) + 78 \n\nExpanding and simplifying: \n\n54Number of innings played + 54 = 51Number of innings played + 78 \n\n3Number of innings played = 24 \n\nNumber of innings played = 8 \n\nTherefore, Sachin played 8 matches in this season. \n\nThe answer is (B) 8.",

If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth? Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, let's find the area of the rectangular piece of cloth. Since it was formed by trimming 4 feet from one edge of the square, the length of the rectangular piece is x-4 and the width is x (where x is the length of the original square). Therefore, the area of the rectangular piece is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x.\n\nNext, we know that the rectangular piece was cut diagonally in half to form two triangles, each with an area of 70 square feet. The area of a triangle is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where b is the base and h is the height. Since the two triangles are congruent, they have the same base and height. Let's call the base of each triangle y. Then, we have:\n\n(1/2)(y)(h) = 70\n\nSolving for h, we get:\n\nh = 140/y\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular piece, which is also the hypotenuse of each triangle. Let's call this length d. Then, we have:\n\nd^2 = (x-4)^2 + x^2\n\nd^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16\n\nd = sqrt(2x^2 - 8x + 16)\n\nSince each triangle has a base of y and a height of h, we can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find the length of the other side of each triangle. Let's call this length z. Then, we have:\n\nz^2 = y^2 + h^2\n\nz^2 = y^2 + (140/y)^2\n\nz = sqrt(y^2 + (140/y)^2)\n\nNow, we know that the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth was 4x. We want to find the value of 4x that satisfies the conditions given in the problem. We know that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so we have:\n\n(1/2)(y)(h) = 70\n\ny(140/y) = 140y^(-1) = 70\n\ny = 2\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nd = sqrt(2x^2 - 8x + 16) = sqrt(2(x-2)^2 + 8)\n\nz = sqrt(y^2 + (140/y)^2) = sqrt(4 + 19600/4) = sqrt(4904)\n\nPerimeter = 4x = 4(x-4) + 2d + 2z = 4x - 16 + 2sqrt(2(x-2)^2 + 8) + 2sqrt(4904)\n\nWe can simplify this expression by factoring out a 2 from the two square roots:\n\nPerimeter = 4x - 16 + 2sqrt(2)(sqrt((x-2)^2 + 4) + sqrt(2452))\n\nNow, we can test each answer choice to see which one satisfies this equation.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the cost price of each bag of flour. We know that the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price, which means that the cost price is 75% of the selling price. \n\nLet's represent the cost price as x. Then, we can write:\n\n0.75x = selling price = $100\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = $100/0.75 = $133.33 (rounded to the nearest cent)\n\nNow that we know the cost price, we can find the profit per bag:\n\nprofit per bag = selling price - cost price = $100 - $133.33 = -$33.33\n\nWait a minute, a negative profit? This means that the grocer is actually losing money on each bag sold. But the problem states that the grocer made a profit of $3,000. What's going on?\n\nWe need to go back and check our calculations. We made a mistake in assuming that the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price. The correct interpretation is that the grocer makes a 25% profit on the cost price. \n\nLet's start over with this new information. We know that the profit per bag is $3,000, and we know that the profit is 25% of the cost price. Let's represent the cost price as x again:\n\nprofit per bag = 0.25x\n\n$3,000 = 0.25x\n\nx = $12,000\n\nNow we can find the selling price:\n\nselling price = cost price + profit = $12,000 + $3,000 = $15,000\n\nAnd finally, we can find the number of bags sold:\n\nnumber of bags sold = total revenue / selling price = $15,000 / $100 = 150\n\nNone of the above.

Substituting the value of r, we get the volume of the sphere as (4/3)\u03c0(a/2)^3 = (1/6)\u03c0a^3.\n\nNow, let's find the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the sphere. \n\nVolume of cube : Volume of sphere = a^3 : (1/6)\u03c0a^3\n\nSimplifying this ratio, we get:\n\nVolume of cube : Volume of sphere = 6 : \u03c0\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 6: \u03c0.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.\n\nWe know that the median income of the family is $3000. This means that half of the family members earn less than $3000 and half of them earn more than $3000.\n\nLet's assume that there are 'n' members in the family. If we arrange their incomes in ascending order, the median income will be the income of the (n+1)/2th member.\n\nSince the median income is $3000, we can write:\n\n(n+1)/2th member's income = $3000\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\n(n+1)th member's income = $6000\n\nWe also know that the total income of the family per month is $9000. So, we can write:\n\nTotal income of the family = Sum of incomes of all members\n\n$9000 = (1st member's income) + (2nd member's income) + ... + (n-1)th member's income + (n)th member's income\n\nWe can substitute (n+1)th member's income with $6000, and simplify the equation:\n\n$9000 = (1st member's income) + (2nd member's income) + ... + (n-1)th member's income + $6000\n\n$3000 = (1st member's income) + (2nd member's income) + ... + (n-1)th member's income\n\nWe know that each member earns some amount of money, which is greater than or equal to $3000.

In this case, the number of ways to select two balls is the same as the total number of ways to select two balls from n-1 balls, which is (n-1)(n-2)/2. \n\nCase 2: The ball with number 3 is in the box. In this case, we need to subtract the number of ways to select two balls that include the ball with number 3 from the total number of ways to select two balls.

Then, the amount they need to pay after the discount is applied is:\n\n$20,000 x (1 - 4%) = $19,200\n\nThe interest the merchant will pay for borrowing \"P\" for 30 days is:\n\nI = P x r x t\n\nwhere \"r\" is the interest rate and \"t\" is the time in years (i.e., 30/365).\n\nThe total amount the merchant will need to pay after 30 days is:\n\n$19,200 + I\n\nThe merchant can afford to borrow money at an interest rate that will make this total amount equal to or less than $20,000 (i.e., the original amount of the invoice).\n\nSo, we can set up the following inequality:\n\n$19,200 + I \u2264 $20,000\n\nSolving for \"I\", we get:\n\nI \u2264 $800\n\nSubstituting in the formula for \"I\", we get:\n\nP x r x t \u2264 $800\n\nPlugging in the values for \"P\" and \"t\", we get:\n\nr \u2264 $800 / ($20,000 x 30/365)\n\nr \u2264 0.0413\n\nMultiplying by 100 to convert to a percentage, we get:\n\nr \u2264 4.13%\n\nTherefore, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 4.13%.\n\nNone of the answer choices provided match this answer, so the correct answer is None of these.",

So, the new number would be '1abcde' and it would be equal to 3 * 'abcde'. \n\nNow, we can write two equations based on the above information: \n\n10 * 'abcde' = 'abcde1' \n\n3 * 'abcde' = '1abcde' \n\nLet's solve for 'abcde' using the first equation: \n\n10 * 'abcde' = 'abcde1' \n\n10 * 'abcde' = 100000 * a + 10000 * b + 1000 * c + 100 * d + 10 * e + 1 \n\nDividing both sides by 10: \n\n'abcde' = 10000 * a + 1000 * b + 100 * c + 10 * d + e + 0.1 \n\nNow, let's substitute this value of 'abcde' in the second equation: \n\n3 * (10000 * a + 1000 * b + 100 * c + 10 * d + e) = 100000 + 10000 * a + 1000 * b + 100 * c + 10 * d + e \n\nSimplifying: \n\n29997 * a + 2997 * b + 297 * c + 27 * d = 99999 \n\nDividing both sides by 3: \n\n9999 * a + 999 * b + 99 * c + 9 * d = 33333 \n\nWe can see that the sum of the digits on the left side is a multiple of 9. So, the sum of the digits on the right side must also be a multiple of 9. \n\nThe only answer choice that satisfies this condition is (A) 42857. \n\nLet's check: \n\n'abcde' = 42857 \n\n'abcde1' = 428571 \n\n'1abcde' = 142857 \n\n10 * 'abcde' = 428570 \n\n3 * 'abcde' = 128571 \n\nSo, (A) 42857 is the correct answer.",

This means that:\n\nh^2 + t^2 + u^2 = 109\n\nWe also know that if we subtract 495 from the number, we get a number with the same digits in reverse order. Let's call the original number \"abc\", where a is the hundreds digit, b is the tens digit, and c is the units digit. Then we can write:\n\nabc - 495 = cba\n\nor\n\n100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n99a - 99c = 495\n\nor\n\na - c = 5\n\nNow we have three equations:\n\nh + t + u = 17\nh^2 + t^2 + u^2 = 109\na - c = 5\n\nWe can use these equations to solve for the values of a, b, and c. One way to do this is to use trial and error. We can start by guessing values for a, b, and c that satisfy the first two equations, and then check if they also satisfy the third equation. If they don't, we can try again with different values.\n\nLet's try a = 3, b = 6, and c = 8.

Let Mohan's share be x, then Sohan's share will be (5100 - x). \n\nNow, we know that both Mohan and Sohan will receive equal amounts on attaining the age of 26 years. So, we can use the formula for compound interest: \n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nwhere A is the amount, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the time period. \n\nLet's assume that the interest is compounded annually. So, Mohan's amount after 3 years (from age 23 to 26) will be:\n\nA1 = x(1 + 0.04)^3\n\nSimilarly, Sohan's amount after 2 years (from age 24 to 26) will be:\n\nA2 = (5100 - x)(1 + 0.04)^2\n\nSince both amounts are equal, we can equate them:\n\nx(1 + 0.04)^3 = (5100 - x)(1 + 0.04)^2\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx = 2600\n\nTherefore, Mohan's share is Rs. 2600. \n\nThe correct answer is (C) 2600.",

We know that distance = speed x time, so:\n\ndistance AB = speed x time AB\ndistance AB = 70t1\n\nNext, we need to find the time it took Kevin to return from point B to point A. Let's call this time t2. We know that distance = speed x time, so:\n\ndistance BA = speed x time BA\ndistance BA = 90t2\n\nWe also know that Kevin was 70 miles away from point B, exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip. Let's call this time t3.

So, after two days, there will be 64 * 2 = 128 water lilies on the lake.\n\nSimilarly, after four days, there will be 128 * 2 = 256 water lilies on the lake.\n\nWe can see that the number of water lilies on the lake is doubling every two days. So, we can write an equation for the number of water lilies on the lake after \"x\" days as follows:\n\n64 * 2^(x/2) = total number of water lilies on the lake\n\nWe know that it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies when there is only one water lily on it. So, we can use this information to solve for \"x\" as follows:\n\n64 * 2^(60/2) = total number of water lilies on the lake\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n64 * 2^30 = total number of water lilies on the lake\n\ntotal number of water lilies on the lake = 1,073,741,824\n\nNow, we can use this value of the total number of water lilies on the lake in the equation we derived earlier to solve for \"x\":\n\n64 * 2^(x/2) = 1,073,741,824\n\nDividing both sides by 64, we get:\n\n2^(x/2) = 16,777,216\n\nTaking the logarithm of both sides, we get:\n\n(x/2) * log(2) = log(16,777,216)\n\nx/2 = log(16,777,216) / log(2)\n\nx/2 = 24\n\nx = 48\n\nTherefore, the lake will be fully covered with lilies in 48 days if initially there were 64 water lilies on it.\n\nNone of the above answer choices is correct.",

Let's call this remainder \"r\". \n\nSo, we can write: \n\n2272 = aN + r \n875 = bN + r \n\nwhere a and b are some integers. \n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get: \n\n1397 = (a - b)N \n\nNow, we know that N is a 3-digit number, so it must be between 100 and 999. Therefore, (a - b) must be a factor of 1397. \n\nThe prime factorization of 1397 is 1397 = 19 x 73. \n\nThe only factors of 1397 are 1 and 1397 itself. Therefore, (a - b) can only be 1 or 1397. \n\nIf (a - b) = 1, then N = 1397. But we also know that the sum of the digits of N must be less than or equal to 27 (since 999 is the largest 3-digit number and its digits add up to 27). However, the sum of the digits of 1397 is 20, which is less than 27. \n\nTherefore, (a - b) cannot be 1. It must be 1397. \n\nSo, we have: \n\n1397N = 1397 x N = 1397(a - b)N = 1397(2272 - 875) = 1397 x 1397 \n\nTherefore, N = 1397. \n\nThe sum of the digits of N is 1 + 3 + 9 + 7 = 20. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (None of the above).",

There are 5C1 ways to choose 1 pair of adjacent vertices and 4C2 ways to choose 2 non-adjacent vertices, which is equal to 30.

We also know that the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi-annually. This means that the interest is calculated twice a year, and added to the principal.\n\nLet's use the formula for compound interest to solve this problem:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nwhere A is the amount at the end of the investment period, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n\nIn this case, we know that A = $54,080, r = 8%, n = 2 (since the interest is compounded semi-annually), and t = 1 year. We want to find P, the original principal.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$54,080 = P(1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)\n\nSimplifying the right-hand side, we get:\n\n$54,080 = P(1.04)^2\n\n$54,080 = P(1.0816)\n\nDividing both sides by 1.0816, we get:\n\nP = $50,000\n\nTherefore, the amount of money that Charles originally invested is $50,000.\n\nThe correct answer is (B) $50,000.",

Since the first term is -50, the last term is -50 + (k-1), and the middle term is (-50 + (-50 + (k-1))) / 2 = -50 + (k-1)/2. So we have:\n\n51 = k * (-50 + (k-1)/2)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n102 = k * (-99 + k)\n\nExpanding the right side, we get:\n\n102 = -99k + k^2\n\nRearranging and factoring, we get:\n\nk^2 - 99k + 102 = 0\n(k - 3)(k - 96) = 0\n\nSo k = 3 or k = 96.

Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the volume of the coin made of alloy. The volume of a cylinder (which is the shape of the coin) is given by the formula V = \u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius (half of the diameter) and h is the height (thickness). \n\nIn this case, r = 7.5 mm and h = 2 mm, so V = \u03c0(7.5)^2(2) = 352.5 mm^3. \n\nSince the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, we can divide this volume by 2 to get the volume of each metal. Therefore, the volume of aluminum in the coin is 176.25 mm^3. \n\nNext, we need to find the weight of this amount of aluminum. We know that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, so the weight of the same volume of silver would be twice that of aluminum. \n\nLet's call the weight of aluminum in the coin W. Then the weight of silver in the coin would be 2W. \n\nWe can set up an equation based on the total weight of the coin: \n\nW + 2W = 30 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n3W = 30 \n\nW = 10 \n\nSo the weight of the aluminum in the coin is 10 grams. \n\nNow we can use this information to find the weight of a pure aluminum coin with the same volume. \n\nThe volume of the new coin is also a cylinder, but with a different radius and height. The radius is now 15/2 = 7.5 mm (half of the new diameter) and the height is 1 mm (half of the new thickness). \n\nThe volume of this cylinder is V = \u03c0(7.5)^2(1) = 176.625 mm^3. \n\nSince the volume of aluminum in the alloy coin is the same as the volume of aluminum in the pure aluminum coin, we know that the weight of the pure aluminum coin is also 10 grams. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 36 grams.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the minimum number of ties we need to take out to ensure that we have at least two ties of the same color. \n\nThe worst-case scenario is that we pick one tie of each color, which would give us a total of 5 ties. However, if we pick one more tie of any color, we will have at least two ties of that color. \n\nSo, we need to take out 6 ties in total to ensure that we have at least two ties of the same color. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) 6.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the length of the space diagonal of the rectangular solid. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find this value:\n\nd = sqrt(3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2)\nd = sqrt(9 + 16 + 225)\nd = sqrt(250)\nd = 5sqrt(10)\n\nNext, we know that the diameter of the sphere is equal to the space diagonal of the rectangular solid. So, the diameter of the sphere is:\n\nD = 2d\nD = 2(5sqrt(10))\nD = 10sqrt(10)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (None of the above) since none of the given answer choices match our calculated value of 10sqrt(10).",
