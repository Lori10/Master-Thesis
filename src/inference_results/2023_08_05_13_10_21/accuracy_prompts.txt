He reads part of a novel every evening, 5 days a week, for 1 hour.  He doubles his reading time on Saturday and Sundays.  How many minutes does Hank spend reading in 1 week?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nHe reads 30 minutes in the morning 5 days a week for a total of 30*5 = <<30*5=150>>150 minutes\nHe doubles his reading time on the weekends so 30*2 = <<30*2=60>>60 minutes per day\nHe reads 60 minutes on Saturday and Sunday in the mornings for a total of 60+60 = <<60+60=120>>120 minutes\nHe reads 1 hour in the evenings 5 days a week for a total of 1*5 = <<1*5=5>>5 hours\nHe doubles his reading time on the weekends so 1*2 = <<1*2=2>>2 hours per day\nHe reads 2 hours on Saturday and Sunday in the evenings for a total of 2+2 = <<2+2=4>>4 hours\nHe read 5+4 = 9 hours which, when converted to minutes is 9*60 = 540 minutes\nHe reads 150 minutes in the morning and 120 minutes in the evenings and 540 over the weekend for a total of 150+120+540 = 810 minutes in 1 week The answer is 810.\n\nQ: Carolyn is planning out her final essay. The introduction will be 450 words, the conclusion will be triple the length of the introduction, and each of the four body sections will be the same length. If her essay has to be 5000 words total, how long is each section?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nFirst find the length of the conclusion by tripling the length of the introduction: 450 words * 3 = <<450*3=1350>>1350 words\nThen subtract the length of the introduction and conclusion from the total length to find the combined length of the body sections: 5000 words - 1350 words - 450 words = <<5000-1350-450=3200>>3200 words\nThen divide the combined length of the body section by the number of body sections to find the length of each section: 3200 words / 4 sections = <<3200/4=800>>800 words/section The answer is 800.\n\nQ: The chicken crossed the road to get to the other side twice for the thrill of it. The first time, it had to dodge 23 speeding cars. The second time, a person tried to catch it and accidentally pulled out twice as many feathers as the number of cars the chicken had dodged. The chicken had 5263 feathers before its thrill-seeking road crossings. How many feathers did it have afterward?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe chicken lost 23 * 2 = <<23*2=46>>46 feathers on its second road crossing.\nThus, it had 5263 - 46 = <<5263-46=5217>>5217 feathers after crossing the road twice. The answer is 5217.\n\nQ: Ivan had $10 and spent 1/5 of it on cupcakes. He then spent some money on a milkshake and had only $3 left. How much is the milkshake?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nIvan spent a total of $10 - $3 = $<<10-3=7>>7 on cupcakes and a milkshake.\nThe cost of the cupcake is $10 x 1/5 = $<<10*1/5=2>>2.\nSo, $7 - $2 = $<<7-2=5>>5 was spent on the milkshake. The answer is 5.\n\nQ: Stefan goes to a restaurant to eat dinner with his family. They order an appetizer that costs $10 and 4 entrees that are $20 each. If they tip 20% of the total for the waiter, what is the total amount of money that they spend at the restaurant?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe total cost of the entrees is 4 * $20 = $<<4*20=80>>80.\nThe total cost of the dinner is $80 + $10 = $<<80+10=90>>90.\nThe tip is $90 * 0.20 = $<<90*0.20=18>>18\nThe total cost with tip is $90 + $18 = $<<90+18=108>>108 The answer is 108.\n\nQ: Melony makes $21 of profit every time she sells 3 shirts and four times as much profit when she sells two pairs of sandals. How much profit will she make if she sells 7 shirts and 3 pairs of sandals?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nMelony makes $21 * 4 = $<<21*4=84>>84 of profit for two pairs of sandals.\nMelony makes $84 / 2 pairs = $<<84/2=42>>42 of profit per pair of shoes.\nMelony makes $21 / 3 shirts = $<<21/3=7>>7 of profit per shirt.\nFor seven shirts, Melony will make 7 shirts * $7 = $<<7*7=49>>49 of profit.\nFor three pairs of sandals, Melony will make 3 pairs * $42/pair = $<<3*42=126>>126 of profit.\nMelony will make a total of $49 + $126 = $<<49+126=175>>175 of profit. The answer is 175.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",

How many didn't pass their exams?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nFind the number of students who got their degree by multiplying: 804 students * 75% = <<804*75*.01=603>>603 students.\nThen find the number of students who didn't pass their exams by subtracting this number from the total: 804 students - 603 students = <<804-603=201>>201 students. The answer is 201.\n\nQ: John decides to buy a month's supply of dog treats.  He gives his dog 2 treats a day and they cost $.1 each.  How much does he spend on the treats if the month is 30 days long?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nHe gives his dog 2*30=<<2*30=60>>60 treats for the month\nSo that means it cost 60*.1=$<<60*.1=6>>6 The answer is 6.\n\nQ: Arnold owns three cars. The first car averages 50 miles per gallon of gas. The second car averages 10 miles per gallon of gas. And the third car averages 15 miles per gallon of gas. He splits his 450-mile monthly driving mileage equally amongst his three cars.  If gas costs $2 per gallon, how much does he spend on gas each month?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nHe drives each vehicle 150 miles because 450 / 3 = <<450/3=150>>150\nThe first car will need 3 gallons of gas because 150 / 50 = <<150/50=3>>3\nThe second car will need 15 gallons of gas because 150 / 10 = <<150/10=15>>15\nThe third car will need 10 gallons of gas because 150 / 15 = <<150/15=10>>10\nHe will need 28 gallons in total because 3 + 15 + 10 = <<3+15+10=28>>28\nThis will cost him $56 because 28 x $2 = $<<28*2=56>>56 The answer is 56.\n\nQ: A busy restaurant is counting how many customers they had during that Friday to try to predict how many they might get on Saturday. During breakfast, they had 73 customers. During lunch, they had 127 customers. During dinner, they had 87 customers. If they predict they'll get twice the amount of customers on Saturday as they had on Friday, how many customers do they predict they will get?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nOn Friday the restaurant had 73 customers for breakfast + 127 customers for lunch + 87 customers for dinner = <<73+127+87=287>>287 customers total on Friday.\nIf they predict getting 2x the amount of customers on Saturday as on Friday, they will have 287 customers x 2 = <<287*2=574>>574 customers on Saturday. The answer is 574.\n\nQ: Every 4 weeks, Helen hand washes her silk pillowcases.  It takes 30 minutes to hand wash all of them.  In 1 year, how much time does Helen spend hand washing her pillowcases?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nShe hand washes them every 4 weeks and there are 52 weeks in a year so she washes them 52/4 = <<52/4=13>>13 times per year\nIt takes her 30 minutes to hand wash the pillowcases and she does this 13 times per year for a total of 30*13 = <<30*13=390>>390 minutes per year The answer is 390.\n\nQ: 4 friends are running a 4 x 100 relay race.  Mary ran first and took twice as long as Susan.  Susan ran second and she took 10 seconds longer than Jen.  Jen ran third and finished in 30 seconds.  Tiffany ran the last leg and finished in 7 seconds less than Mary.  How many seconds did it take the team to finish the race?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nSusan's time was 30 seconds + 10 seconds = <<30+10=40>>40 seconds.\nMary's time was 40 seconds * 2 = <<40*2=80>>80 seconds.\nTiffany's time was 80 seconds - 7 seconds = <<80-7=73>>73 seconds.\nThe total time for the team was 80 seconds + 40 seconds + 30 seconds + 73 seconds = <<80+40+30+73=223>>223 seconds.
