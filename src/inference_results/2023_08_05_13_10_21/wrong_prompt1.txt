He reads part of a novel every evening, 5 days a week, for 1 hour.  He doubles his reading time on Saturday and Sundays.  How many minutes does Hank spend reading in 1 week?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nHe reads 30 minutes in the morning 5 days a week for a total of 30*5 = <<30*5=150>>150 minutes\nHe doubles his reading time on the weekends so 30*2 = <<30*2=60>>60 minutes per day\nHe reads 60 minutes on Saturday and Sunday in the mornings for a total of 60+60 = <<60+60=120>>120 minutes\nHe reads 1 hour in the evenings 5 days a week for a total of 1*5 = <<1*5=5>>5 hours\nHe doubles his reading time on the weekends so 1*2 = <<1*2=2>>2 hours per day\nHe reads 2 hours on Saturday and Sunday in the evenings for a total of 2+2 = <<2+2=4>>4 hours\nHe read 5+4 = 9 hours which, when converted to minutes is 9*60 = 540 minutes\nHe reads 150 minutes in the morning and 120 minutes in the evenings and 540 over the weekend for a total of 150+120+540 = 810 minutes in 1 week The answer is 810.\n\nQ: Carolyn is planning out her final essay. The introduction will be 450 words, the conclusion will be triple the length of the introduction, and each of the four body sections will be the same length. If her essay has to be 5000 words total, how long is each section?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nFirst find the length of the conclusion by tripling the length of the introduction: 450 words * 3 = <<450*3=1350>>1350 words\nThen subtract the length of the introduction and conclusion from the total length to find the combined length of the body sections: 5000 words - 1350 words - 450 words = <<5000-1350-450=3200>>3200 words\nThen divide the combined length of the body section by the number of body sections to find the length of each section: 3200 words / 4 sections = <<3200/4=800>>800 words/section The answer is 800.\n\nQ: The chicken crossed the road to get to the other side twice for the thrill of it. The first time, it had to dodge 23 speeding cars. The second time, a person tried to catch it and accidentally pulled out twice as many feathers as the number of cars the chicken had dodged. The chicken had 5263 feathers before its thrill-seeking road crossings. How many feathers did it have afterward?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe chicken lost 23 * 2 = <<23*2=46>>46 feathers on its second road crossing.\nThus, it had 5263 - 46 = <<5263-46=5217>>5217 feathers after crossing the road twice. The answer is 5217.\n\nQ: Ivan had $10 and spent 1/5 of it on cupcakes. He then spent some money on a milkshake and had only $3 left. How much is the milkshake?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nIvan spent a total of $10 - $3 = $<<10-3=7>>7 on cupcakes and a milkshake.\nThe cost of the cupcake is $10 x 1/5 = $<<10*1/5=2>>2.\nSo, $7 - $2 = $<<7-2=5>>5 was spent on the milkshake. The answer is 5.\n\nQ: Stefan goes to a restaurant to eat dinner with his family. They order an appetizer that costs $10 and 4 entrees that are $20 each. If they tip 20% of the total for the waiter, what is the total amount of money that they spend at the restaurant?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe total cost of the entrees is 4 * $20 = $<<4*20=80>>80.\nThe total cost of the dinner is $80 + $10 = $<<80+10=90>>90.\nThe tip is $90 * 0.20 = $<<90*0.20=18>>18\nThe total cost with tip is $90 + $18 = $<<90+18=108>>108 The answer is 108.\n\nQ: Melony makes $21 of profit every time she sells 3 shirts and four times as much profit when she sells two pairs of sandals. How much profit will she make if she sells 7 shirts and 3 pairs of sandals?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nMelony makes $21 * 4 = $<<21*4=84>>84 of profit for two pairs of sandals.\nMelony makes $84 / 2 pairs = $<<84/2=42>>42 of profit per pair of shoes.\nMelony makes $21 / 3 shirts = $<<21/3=7>>7 of profit per shirt.\nFor seven shirts, Melony will make 7 shirts * $7 = $<<7*7=49>>49 of profit.\nFor three pairs of sandals, Melony will make 3 pairs * $42/pair = $<<3*42=126>>126 of profit.\nMelony will make a total of $49 + $126 = $<<49+126=175>>175 of profit. The answer is 175.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step."}
