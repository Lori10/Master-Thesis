{'prompt': "You are an expert at arithmetic reasoning and are willing to solve grade school math problems. To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\nQ: A certain telescope increases the visual range at a particular location from 90 kilometers to 150 kilometers. By what percent is the visual range increased by using the telescope ? Answer Choices: (A) 30% (B) 33 1/2% (C) 40% (D) 60% (E) 66 2/3%\nA: Let's think step by step.\nOriginal visual range = 90 km\nNew visual range = 150 km\nPercent increase in the visual range by using the telescope\n= (150-90)/90 * 100%\n= 2/3 * 100%\n= 66.67 %\nAnswer E The answer is E.\n\nQ: When positive integer G is divided by positive integer B, the result is 4.35. Which of the following could be the reminder when G is divided by B? Answer Choices: (A)  13 (B)  14 (C)  15 (D)  16 (E)  17\nA: Let's think step by step.\nthe remainder will be obtained from the decimal part when G is divided by B i.e. 0.35\n0.35 = 35/100 = 7/20 so possible remainders are 7,14,21,28. Only option B-14 satisfies this\nPS: for B-14 G=174 and B=40 The answer is B.\n\nQ: Solve the equation:\n|(2x + 1)2 - 4x2 - 2| - 3|4x – 1| = - 6 Answer Choices: (A) -1/2 (B) 1/2 (C) -3/4 (D) 3 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step.\nSolution:\n|(2x + 1)2 - 4x2 - 2| – 3|4x -1| = - 6 <=>\n|4x2 + 4x + 1 - 4x2 - 2 | - 3|4x - 1| = - 6 <=>\n|4x – 1| - 3|4x – 1| = - 6 <=> -2|4x – 1| = - 6 <=>\n|4x – 1| = 3 <=> 4x - 1 = 3 or 4x - 1 = -3\nTherefore x = 1 or x = -1/2\nAnswer A The answer is A.\n\nQ: A man in a train travelling at 20km/hr notices that a train going in the opposite direction passes him in 5 sec.If the length of this train is 140m find its speed . Answer Choices: (A) 30 km/hr (B) 40 km/hr (C) 81 km/hr (D) 60 km/hr (E) 70 km/hr\nA: Let's think step by step.\nrelative speed of trains = 140/5 mtrs/sec = 140*18/(5*5)= 101 km/hr\nspeed of 2nd train = 101-20=81 km/hr\nANSWER:C The answer is C.\n\nQ: How many digits 2^400 has? Answer Choices: (A) 31 (B) 35 (C) 50 (D) 99 (E) 121\nA: Let's think step by step.\n2^10 = 1.024 * 10^3 => 2^100 = (1.024)^10 * 10^120\ntherefore 121 digits would be my best guess\nE The answer is E.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step."}
