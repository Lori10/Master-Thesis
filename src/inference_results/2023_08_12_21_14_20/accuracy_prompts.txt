To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\nQ: A certain telescope increases the visual range at a particular location from 90 kilometers to 150 kilometers. By what percent is the visual range increased by using the telescope ? Answer Choices: (A) 30% (B) 33 1/2% (C) 40% (D) 60% (E) 66 2/3%\nA: Let's think step by step.\nOriginal visual range = 90 km\nNew visual range = 150 km\nPercent increase in the visual range by using the telescope\n= (150-90)/90 * 100%\n= 2/3 * 100%\n= 66.67 %\nAnswer E The answer is E.\n\nQ: When positive integer G is divided by positive integer B, the result is 4.35. Which of the following could be the reminder when G is divided by B? Answer Choices: (A)  13 (B)  14 (C)  15 (D)  16 (E)  17\nA: Let's think step by step.\nthe remainder will be obtained from the decimal part when G is divided by B i.e. 0.35\n0.35 = 35/100 = 7/20 so possible remainders are 7,14,21,28. Only option B-14 satisfies this\nPS: for B-14 G=174 and B=40 The answer is B.\n\nQ: Solve the equation:\n|(2x + 1)2 - 4x2 - 2| - 3|4x \u2013 1| = - 6 Answer Choices: (A) -1/2 (B) 1/2 (C) -3/4 (D) 3 (E) None\nA: Let's think step by step.\nSolution:\n|(2x + 1)2 - 4x2 - 2| \u2013 3|4x -1| = - 6 <=>\n|4x2 + 4x + 1 - 4x2 - 2 | - 3|4x - 1| = - 6 <=>\n|4x \u2013 1| - 3|4x \u2013 1| = - 6 <=> -2|4x \u2013 1| = - 6 <=>\n|4x \u2013 1| = 3 <=> 4x - 1 = 3 or 4x - 1 = -3\nTherefore x = 1 or x = -1/2\nAnswer A The answer is A.\n\nQ: A man in a train travelling at 20km/hr notices that a train going in the opposite direction passes him in 5 sec.If the length of this train is 140m find its speed . Answer Choices: (A) 30 km/hr (B) 40 km/hr (C) 81 km/hr (D) 60 km/hr (E) 70 km/hr\nA: Let's think step by step.\nrelative speed of trains = 140/5 mtrs/sec = 140*18/(5*5)= 101 km/hr\nspeed of 2nd train = 101-20=81 km/hr\nANSWER:C The answer is C.\n\nQ: How many digits 2^400 has? Answer Choices: (A) 31 (B) 35 (C) 50 (D) 99 (E) 121\nA: Let's think step by step.\n2^10 = 1.024 * 10^3 => 2^100 = (1.024)^10 * 10^120\ntherefore 121 digits would be my best guess\nE The answer is E.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",

To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\nQ: Two pipes P and Q can fill a cistern in 12 and 14 minutes respectively. Both are opened together, but at the end of 3 minutes the first is turned off. How much longer will the cistern take to fill? Answer Choices: (A) 11 1/2 min (B) 11 1/4 min (C) 11 2/4 min (D) 11 1/5 min (E) 10 1/2 min\nA: Let's think step by step.\n3/12 + x/14 = 1\nx= 10 1/2\nAnswer: E The answer is E.\n\nQ: There is a 50% chance Jen will visit Chile this year, while there is a 25% chance that she will visit Madagascar this year. What is the probability that Jen will visit either Chile or Madagascar this year, but NOT both?[/b] Answer Choices: (A) 25% (B) 50% (C) 62.5% (D) 63.5% (E) 75%\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe thing to note in the question is she would not be visiting both.\nThus p(Chile)*(1-p(Madagascar))+p(Madagascar)*(1-p(Chile))\nwhich is\n(1/2*3/4) + (1/4*1/2),\n3/8*1/8=1/2 =50%\nAnswer: B The answer is B.\n\nQ: If 3d + 1 < 2d < 9 - d, which of the following must be true?\nI. -1 < d < 3\nII. d < -1\nIII. d < 3 Answer Choices: (A)  II only (B)  III only (C)  I and II only (D)  II and III only (E)  I, II and III\nA: Let's think step by step.\nJust try plugging d in a number like 0 or 1, and you'll quickly find that the inequality doesn't hold.\nSo you can immediately cross out any answers with I or III, leaving just (A) II only. The answer is A.\n\nQ: A certain characteristic in a large population has a distribution that is symmetric about the mean m. 64 percent of the distribution lies within one standard deviation d of the mean. If the shelf\u2019s average life is 7.8 years and the standard deviation is 2.4 years, what percent of the distribution has more than 10.2 years as a shelf\u2019s average life? Answer Choices: (A) 15% (B) 16% (C) 17% (D) 18% (E) 19%\nA: Let's think step by step.\nAverage = 7.8\nSD = 2.4\n7.8 - 2.4 < 64% of distribution < 7.8 + 2.4\n5.4 < 64% of distribution < 10.2\n36% is outside this range.\nGiven: Distribution is symmetric. So 18% of distribution is less than 5.4 and the other 18% of distribution is greater than 10.2.\nAnswer: D The answer is D.\n\nQ: The edges of a cuboid are 4 cm, 4 cm and 6 cm.
