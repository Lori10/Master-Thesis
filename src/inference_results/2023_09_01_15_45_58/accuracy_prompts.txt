        "prompt": "You are an expert at arithmetic reasoning and are willing to solve algebraic word problems. Select the correct answer from the given options. If none of the options are correct, generate 'None of the above'. To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\n\nQ: Three friends-whose walking rates are 1 ft./sec., 3ft./sec.,and 6ft./sec. start together walking in the same direction around a circular track that is 420 feet in circumference.After how many minutes are the three of them together again? Answer Choices: (A) 5 mins (B) 10 mins (C) 15 mins (D) 3 mins (E) 7 mins\n\nA: Let's think step by step. The time they take will be what the 1st friend takes to complete one circumference as he is the slowest and that is the point all 3 of them will be together at the end of 7 mins. E The answer is E.\n\nQ: The average of temperatures at noontime from Monday to Friday is 40; the lowest one is 30, what is the possible maximum range of the temperatures? Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 25 (C) 50 (D) 45 (E) 75\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Average=40, Sum of temperatures=40*5=200 As the min temperature is 30, max would be 200-4*30=80 --> The range=80(max)-30(min)=50 Answer: C The answer is C.\n\nQ: Number of ways in which the letters of word PARDENS can be arranged with vowels in alphabetical order, is Answer Choices: (A) 360 (B) 240 (C) 2520 (D) 480 (E) None of these\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Solution Order of vowels of fixed \u00e2\u02c6\u00b4 required number of ways are 7!/2!. Answer C The answer is C.\n\nQ: If the range of the set of numbers {150, 90, 125, 110, 170, 155, x, 100, 140} is 90, which of the following could be x? Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 95 (C) 110 (D) 125 (E) 140\n\nA: Let's think step by step. The range of the other 8 numbers is 170-90 = 80, so x must be either the smallest number or the largest number in the set. Then x = 170-90 = 80 or x = 90+90 = 180 The answer is A. The answer is A.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
