To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\n\nQ: Alma is taking a walk and comes across four goats standing behind a fence. Alma has a bag of baby carrots she brought to have for a snack and decides to feed the goats with them. Alma wants to make sure all the goats get the same amount of carrots, so she starts counting them out. She has 47 baby carrots. If she wants to give the exact same amount of carrots to each goat and wants to feed them all the carrots she can, how many will she have left over?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nAlma has 47 baby carrots to feed 3 goats, 47 / 4 = <<47/4=11.75>>11.75 baby carrots.\nIf she takes away the remaining .75, each goat gets an even 11 carrots each.\nIf Alma feeds 11 carrots to each of 4 goats, that's a total of 11 * 4 = <<11*4=44>>44 carrots Alma feeds the goats.\nShe started with 47 baby carrots - 44 she feeds the goats = <<47-44=3>>3 baby carrots left over. The answer is 3.\n\nQ: Arthur has 3 dogs. They eat an average of 15 pounds of food a week. One dog eats 13 pounds a week. The second eats double this. How much does the third dog eat a week?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe second dog eats 26 pounds a week because 13 x 2 = <<13*2=26>>26\nIn total they eat 45 pounds because 3 x 15 = <<3*15=45>>45\nThe third dog eats 6 pounds a week because 45 - 13 - 26 = <<45-13-26=6>>6 The answer is 6.\n\nQ: A fixer uses 30% of the nails in a container to repair the kitchen. He also used 70% of the remaining nails in the container to repair the fence. If there were 400 nails in the container, how many nails are remaining?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe fixer used 30/100*400 = <<30/100*400=120>>120 nails to fix the kitchen.\nThe number of nails remaining in the container after he fixes the kitchen is 400-120 = <<400-120=280>>280\nHe also uses 70/100*280 = <<70/100*280=196>>196 of the nails remaining in the container to fix the fence.\nThe total number of nails which the fixer hasn't used is 280-196 = <<280-196=84>>84 The answer is 84.\n\nQ: Jerry is refilling the duck pond in his backyard during a drought. The pond can hold 200 gallons of water. Jerry's hose can normally pump 6 gallons/minute, but due to drought restrictions, it can only pump 2/3rds as fast right now. How many minutes will it take Jerry to fill his pond?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nFirst find the current rate the hose pumps by multiplying its normal rate by 2/3: 6 gallons/minute * 2/3 = <<6*2/3=4>>4 gallons/minute\nThen divide the number of gallons in the pond by the number of gallons pumped each minute to find how many minutes filling the pond takes: 200 gallons / 4 gallons/minute = <<200/4=50>>50 minutes The answer is 50.\n\nQ: Jan enters a double dutch competition.  After training she doubles her speed which used to be 70 skips per minute.  How many skips does she do in 5 minutes?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nShe does 70*2=<<70*2=140>>140 skips a minute\nSo he does 140*5=<<140*5=700>>700 skips in the 5 minutes The answer is 700.\n\nQ: John takes 3 days off of streaming per week.  On the days he does stream, he streams for 4 hours at a time and makes $10 an hour.  How much does he make a week?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nHe streams for 7-3=<<7-3=4>>4 days a week\nSo he streams 4*4=<<4*4=16>>16 hours a week\nThat means he makes 16*10=$<<16*10=160>>160 a week The answer is 160.\n\nQ: Maria's birthday is in 22 days. Her friend Lilly wants to buy her flowers so she saves $2 each day until Maria's birthday. If a flower costs $4, how many flowers can she buy?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nIn 22 days she will have 22 days * $2/day = $<<22*2=44>>44\nA flower costs $4 so she can buy $44 / $4/flower = <<44/4=11>>11 flowers The answer is 11.\n\nQ: Tonya has opened a lemonade stand selling lemonade in small, medium, and large cups at $1, $2 and $3 respectively. At the close of business she ended up making $50.  As she went back through her inventory she noticed that she sold $11 worth of small lemonades and $24 worth of medium lemonades. How many cups of large lemonade did Tonya sell?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\n1. Tonya sold $11 worth of small lemonades and $24 worth of medium lemonades which makes $11 + $24= $<<11+24=35>>35 for small and medium lemonades.\n2. Tonya made a total of $50. If she made $35 selling the two smaller sizes and she sold three sizes in all then $50-$35= $<<50-35=15>>15 worth of large lemonades.\n3. The large lemonades sold for $3 each and Tonya sold $15 worth of large lemonades which means she sold $15/$3=<<15/3=5>>5 large cups of lemonade. The answer is 5.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
