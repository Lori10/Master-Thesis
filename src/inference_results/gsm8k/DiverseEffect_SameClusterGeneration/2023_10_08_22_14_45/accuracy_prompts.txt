To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\n\nQ: Billy has 8 hours of free time on each day of the weekend. He wants to spend 75% of his time playing video games and the rest of his time reading. He can read 60 pages an hour and his books all contain 80 pages. How many books does he read?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nHe has 16 hours because 2 x 8 = <<2*8=16>>16\nHe is going to spend 25% of his time reading because 100 - 75 = <<100-75=25>>25\nHe has 4 hours to read because 16 x .25 = <<16*.25=4>>4\nHe will read 240 pages because 4 x 60 = <<4*60=240>>240\nHe will read 3 books because 240 / 80 = <<240/80=3>>3 The answer is 3.\n\nQ: There are 248 pages in a book. Joanna can read 16 pages per hour. On Monday, she reads for 3 hours. On Tuesday, she reads for 6.5 hours. How many more hours does she need to read to finish the book?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nOn Monday, Joanna reads 3*16=<<3*16=48>>48 pages.\nOn Tuesday, Joanna reads 6.5 * 16 =<<6.5*16=104>>104 pages.\nSo far, she has read 48 +104 =<<48+104=152>>152 pages.\nThus, she has 248-152 = <<248-152=96>>96 pages left.\nShe will need to read for 96/16 = <<96/16=6>>6 hours to finish the book. The answer is 6.\n\nQ: Larry jogs for 30 minutes each day. In the first week, he jogs for 3 days while he jogs for 5 days in the second week. How many hours does he jog in total for two weeks?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nLarry jogs for a total of 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 days.\nThus, he jogs a total of 8 x 30 = <<8*30=240>>240 minutes.\nThis is equal to 240/60 = <<240/60=4>>4 hours. The answer is 4.\n\nQ: A book has 8 chapters. Beth has read 2 chapters in 3 hours. If she continues reading at that rate, in how many hours will she be able to finish reading the remaining chapters?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nBeth still needs to read 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 chapters.\nShe can read 1 chapter in 3/2 = <<1.5=1.5>>1.5 hours.\nTherefore, she will be able to finish reading the remaining chapters in 1.5 x 6 = <<1.5*6=9>>9 hours. The answer is 9.\n\nQ: Jill has a difficult test to study for.  She decides to study one day for 2 hours.  The next day she doubles this amount, and the day after that she studies one hour less than the previous day.  How many minutes does Jill study over the 3 days?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nFirst, we need to determine how many hours Jill studied in total. To find this out, we begin by performing 2*2= <<2*2=4>>4 hours spent on day two, double what she spent on day 1.\nNext, we perform 4-1= <<4-1=3>>3 hours to determine the amount she studied on the third day.\nWe then add 2+4+3= <<2+4+3=9>>9 hours spent in total across 3 days.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, she studied 9*60=<<9*60=540>>540 minutes in total. The answer is 540.\n\nQ: Peter and Kristin are to read 20 fantasy novels each in a week. Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin. If Peter reads one book in 18 hours, how long will Kristin read half of her books?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nSince Peter reads three times as fast as Kristin, Kristin will take 18*3 = <<18*3=54>>54 hours to read one book.\nKristin reads half of her books, a total of 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 books.\nThe time Kristin will take to read half of her books is 10*54 = <<10*54=540>>540 The answer is 540.\n\nQ: Jenny wants to read 3 books in the next 10 days. She can read 100 words per hour. If the first book has 200 words, the second book has 400 words, and the third book has 300 words, how many minutes per day, on average, should she spend reading?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nShe wants to read 200+400+300=<<200+400+300=900>>900 pages total.\nShe needs to spend 900/100 = <<900/100=9>>9 hours reading in the next three weeks.\nIn minutes, she will need to spend 9*60 = <<9*60=540>>540 minutes.\nThus, she should spend 540 minutes/10 days = <<540/10=54>>54 minutes per day reading. The answer is 54.\n\nQ: Hank reads the newspaper every morning, 5 days a week for 30 minutes.  He reads part of a novel every evening, 5 days a week, for 1 hour.  He doubles his reading time on Saturday and Sundays.  How many minutes does Hank spend reading in 1 week?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nHe reads 30 minutes in the morning 5 days a week for a total of 30*5 = <<30*5=150>>150 minutes\nHe doubles his reading time on the weekends so 30*2 = <<30*2=60>>60 minutes per day\nHe reads 60 minutes on Saturday and Sunday in the mornings for a total of 60+60 = <<60+60=120>>120 minutes\nHe reads 1 hour in the evenings 5 days a week for a total of 1*5 = <<1*5=5>>5 hours\nHe doubles his reading time on the weekends so 1*2 = <<1*2=2>>2 hours per day\nHe reads 2 hours on Saturday and Sunday in the evenings for a total of 2+2 = <<2+2=4>>4 hours\nHe read 5+4 = 9 hours which, when converted to minutes is 9*60 = 540 minutes\nHe reads 150 minutes in the morning and 120 minutes in the evenings and 540 over the weekend for a total of 150+120+540 = 810 minutes in 1 week The answer is 810.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
