To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\n\nQ: Alexander is going food shopping. If he buys 5 apples for $1 each and 2 oranges for $2 each, how much does he spend?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nAlexander spends 5 * $1 = $<<5*1=5>>5 on apples.\nHe spends 2 * $2 = $<<2*2=4>>4 on oranges.\nIn total, he spends $5 + $4 = $<<5+4=9>>9. The answer is 9.\n\nQ: Marcia wants to buy some fruit. Apples cost $2, bananas cost $1, and oranges cost $3. If Marcia buys 12 apples, 4 bananas and 4 oranges, what is the average cost of each piece of fruit in dollars?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nFind the price of each group of fruit\n12 apples * $2 per apple = $<<12*2=24>>24\n4 bananas * $1 per banana = $<<4*1=4>>4\n3 oranges * $4 per orange = $<<3*4=12>>12\n$24 + $4 + $12 = $<<24+4+12=40>>40 in total that was spent\n12 + 4 + 4 = <<12+4+4=20>>20 total fruits bought\n$40 / 20 fruits = $<<40/20=2>>2 per fruit The answer is 2.\n\nQ: A bag of dozen apples costs $14 and Brian has already spent $10 on kiwis and half that much on bananas. What's the maximum number of apples Brian can buy if he left his house with only $50 and needs to pay the $3.50 subway fare each way?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nBrian requires a total of $3.50 + $3.50 = $<<3.5+3.5=7>>7 to pay for the round trip subway fare\nWe also know he has spent half (1/2) the amount he spent on kiwis on bananas, so he'll spend (1/2) * $10 = $5 on bananas\nSo far in total he has spent $7 for his subway fare + $5 on bananas + $10 on kiwis = $7 + $5 + $10 = $<<7+5+10=22>>22\nIf he left his house with only $50, then all he will have left for apples would be $50 - $22 = $<<50-22=28>>28\nIf a bag of apples costs $14, then Brian would only be able to buy a maximum of $28/$14 = 2 bags of apples\nIf each bag of apples has a dozen (12) apples, then (2) two bags will have 12*2= <<2*12=24>>24 apples The answer is 24.\n\nQ: Betty bought 1 kg of oranges and 3 kg of apples. The total cost of oranges was $12. The apples were two times cheaper than the oranges. How much did Betty pay for 1 kg of apples?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe cost of the apples was $12 / 2 = $<<12/2=6>>6.\nWhen the cost of 3 kg of apples was $6, then the cost of 1 kg of apples was $6 / 3 kg = $<<6/3=2>>2/kg. The answer is 2.\n\nQ: Kenneth has $50 to go to the store. Kenneth bought 2 baguettes and 2 bottles of water. Each baguette cost $2 and each bottle of water cost $1. How much money does Kenneth have left?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe cost of the baguettes is 2 \u00d7 $2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.\nThe cost of the water is 2 \u00d7 $1 = $<<2*1=2>>2.\nThe total cost of the shopping is $4 + $2 = $<<4+2=6>>6.\nKenneth has $50 \u2212 $6 = $44 left. The answer is 44.\n\nQ: John buys 20 candy bars.  His brother Dave pays for 6 of them.  If each candy bar costs $1.50, how much did John pay?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nHe paid for 20-6=<<20-6=14>>14 candy bars\nSo he paid 14*1.5=$<<14*1.5=21>>21 The answer is 21.\n\nQ: Susie opens a pizza store. She charges $3 per slice and $15 for a whole pizza. If she was able to sell 24 slices of pizza and 3 whole pizzas, how much money did she earn?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nShe was able to earn 24 x 3= $<<24*3=72>>72 after selling 24 slices.\nShe earned 15 x 3= $<<15*3=45>>45 after selling 3 whole pizzas.\nTherefore, she earned a total of $72+$45= $<<72+45=117>>117. The answer is 117.\n\nQ: Sean buys 3 cans of soda, 2 soups, and 1 sandwich.  Each soup cost as much as the 3 combined sodas.  The sandwich cost 3 times as much as the soup.  If the soda cost $1 how much did everything cost together?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe soda cost 3*1=$<<3*1=3>>3\nSo the soups cost 2*3=$<<2*3=6>>6\nThe sandwich cost 3*3=$<<3*3=9>>9\nSo the total cost of everything was 3+6+9=$<<3+6+9=18>>18 The answer is 18.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
