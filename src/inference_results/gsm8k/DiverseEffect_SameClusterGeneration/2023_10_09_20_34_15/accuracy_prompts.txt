        "prompt": "You are an expert at arithmetic reasoning and are willing to solve grade school math problems. To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\n\nQ: Mary wants 144 cupcakes for her party. Mary has already made 36 cherry cupcakes, and 48 berry cupcakes. Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes for the rest. How much of each should she make?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nMary currently has 36 cherry + 48 berry cupcakes = <<36+48=84>>84 cupcakes.\nMary needs an additional 144 cupcakes \u2013 84 = <<144-84=60>>60 cupcakes.\nMary wants to split that number evenly between chocolate and vanilla, so 60 / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 cupcakes of each flavor. The answer is 30.\n\nQ: There are four members in one household. Each member consumes 3 slices of bread during breakfast and 2 slices of bread for snacks. A loaf of bread has 12 slices. How many days will five loaves of bread last in this family?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nA total of 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 slices of bread are consumed by each member every day.\nSo a family consumes a total of 5 x 4 = <<5*4=20>>20 slices of bread every day.\nFive loaves of bread have 5 x 12 = <<5*12=60>>60 slices of bread.\nThus, the 5 loaves of bread last for 60/20 = <<60/20=3>>3 days. The answer is 3.\n\nQ: Michelle is bringing sandwiches to work to give to her co-workers. She gives 4 sandwiches to one of her co-workers and keeps twice this amount for herself. If she had originally made 20 sandwiches, how many sandwiches does she have left to give to her other co-workers?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nMichelle kept 4 sandwiches * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 sandwiches for herself.\nThis leaves 20 total sandwiches \u2013 4 sandwiches for a coworker \u2013 8 sandwiches for herself = <<20-4-8=8>>8 sandwiches for her other co-workers. The answer is 8.\n\nQ: Monica made cookies for herself and her family. Her father ate 10 cookies and her mother ate half as much as the father. Her brother ate 2 more than her mother. How many cookies are left for Monica if she made 30 cookies in total?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nMonica's mother ate half as many cookies as Monica's father, so she ate 10 cookies / 2 = <<10/2=5>>5 cookies.\nMonica's brother ate 5 cookies + 2 cookies = <<5+2=7>>7 cookies.\nThere were 30 cookies - 7 cookies - 5 cookies - 10 cookies = <<30-7-5-10=8>>8 cookies left for Monica. The answer is 8.\n\nQ: Brenda bakes 20 cakes a day. She does this for 9 days and then sells half of the cakes. How many cakes are left with Brenda?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nAfter 9 days, Brenda bakes 20 * 9 = <<20*9=180>>180 cakes.\nAfter she sells half of them, the remaining will be 180 / 2 = <<180/2=90>>90 cakes. The answer is 90.\n\nQ: For every sandwich that he eats, Sam eats four apples. If he eats 10 sandwiches every day for one week, how many apples does he eat?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nTen sandwiches every day for one week is 7*10 = <<7*10=70>>70 sandwiches.\nFor every sandwich that Sam eats, he eats four apples, and since he ate 70 sandwiches, he ate 70*4 =<<70*4=280>>280 apples. The answer is 280.\n\nQ: A box holds 2 dozen doughnuts. If the family ate 8 doughnuts, how many doughnuts are left?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nTwo dozens of doughnuts are equal to 2 x 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 doughnuts.\nSince 8 doughnuts were eaten, therefore 24 - 8 = <<24-8=16>>16 doughnuts are left. The answer is 16.\n\nQ: Shane prepares sandwiches for the Boy Scouts. He buys 2 packages of sliced bread containing 20 slices each, and he also buys 2 packages of sliced ham containing 8 slices each. Shane will make as many sandwiches as he can according to the ham he has. How many slices of bread will he have leftover?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nWith 2 packages of sliced ham, Shane has 2 * 8 = <<2*8=16>>16 slices of ham.\nSince he has 16 slices, Shane makes 16 sandwiches.\nWith 2 packages of sliced bread, he has 20 * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 slices of bread.\nTo make the 16 sandwiches, he needs 16 * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 slices of bread.\nHe has 40 - 32 = <<40-32=8>>8 slices of bread leftover. The answer is 8.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
