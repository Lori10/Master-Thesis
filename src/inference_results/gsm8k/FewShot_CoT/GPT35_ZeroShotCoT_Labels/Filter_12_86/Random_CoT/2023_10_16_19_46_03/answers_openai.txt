Half of the vehicles on the lot are Dodge, and there are half as many Hyundai vehicles on the lot as there are Dodge vehicles.  How many Kia vehicles are on the lot?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that half of the vehicles on the lot are Dodge. So, we can start by finding half of 400: 400/2 = 200 Therefore, there are 200 Dodge vehicles on the lot. Next, we know that there are half as many Hyundai vehicles on the lot as there are Dodge vehicles. So, we can find half of the number of Dodge vehicles: 200/2 = 100 Therefore, there are 100 Hyundai vehicles on the lot. Finally, we can find the number of Kia vehicles by subtracting the number of Dodge and Hyundai vehicles from the total number of vehicles on the lot: 400 - 200 - 100 = 100 Therefore, there are 100 Kia vehicles on the lot. The answer is 100.\n\nQ: Eric has 20 marbles. He has 12 white marbles, 6 blue marbles, and the rest are green marbles. How many green marbles does Eric have?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Eric has a total of 20 marbles. Out of those 20 marbles, he has 12 white marbles and 6 blue marbles. To find out how many green marbles he has, we need to subtract the number of white and blue marbles from the total number of marbles: 20 - 12 - 6 = 2 Therefore, Eric has 2 green marbles. The answer is 2.\n\nQ: Dante needs half as many cups of flour to bake his chocolate cake as he needs eggs. If he uses 60 eggs in his recipe, calculate the total number of cups of flour and eggs that he uses altogether.\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cups of flour Dante needs. We know that he needs half as many cups of flour as he needs eggs. So, if he needs 60 eggs, he needs half as many cups of flour, which is 60/2 = 30 cups of flour. Next, we need to calculate the total number of cups of flour and eggs that Dante uses altogether. Dante uses 60 eggs and 30 cups of flour, so the total number of cups of flour and eggs that he uses altogether is 60 + 30 = 90. Therefore, Dante uses a total of 90 cups of flour and eggs altogether in his recipe. The answer is 90.\n\nQ: Miriam currently has 30 marbles, but she used to have more. Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, gave her sister twice that amount and gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has. How many marbles did Miriam start with?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, so she now has 30 - 60 = -30 marbles. This doesn't make sense, so we know that Miriam must have started with more than 60 marbles. Next, we know that Miriam gave her sister twice the amount she gave her brother, so her sister received 2 * 60 = 120 marbles. We also know that Miriam gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has, so Savanna received 3 * 30 = 90 marbles. In total, Miriam gave away 60 + 120 + 90 = 270 marbles. If Miriam started with x marbles, we can set up the equation: x - 270 = 30 Solving for x, we get: x = 300 Therefore, Miriam started with 300 marbles. The answer is 300.\n\nQ: Emery's family decides to travel for a weekend trip. They drive the first 100 miles in 1 hour. They stop at a McDonald's and then continue the rest of the journey for 300 miles. What's the total number of hours they traveled?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, they drove 100 miles in 1 hour. Then, they stopped at McDonald's, which we don't know how long it took. Finally, they continued the rest of the journey for 300 miles. So, the total distance they traveled is 100 + 300 = 400 miles. We know they drove the first 100 miles in 1 hour, but we don't know how long they stopped at McDonald's. Let's call that time \"x\". Then, they drove the remaining 300 miles. Let's call the time it took to drive that distance \"y\". So, the total time they traveled is: 1 hour (for the first 100 miles) + x (for the time they stopped at McDonald's) + y (for the remaining 300 miles) We don't know x or y, but we do know that the total time they traveled is the sum of those three values. Therefore, the answer is: Total time = 1 + x + y hours. The answer is 1.\n\nQ: There were 80 cars in a parking lot. At lunchtime, 13 cars left the parking lot but 5 more cars went in than left. How many cars are in the parking lot now?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there were 80 cars in the parking lot. Then, 13 cars left, so we can subtract 13 from 80: 80 - 13 = 67 Now, we know that there are 67 cars in the parking lot. But we also know that 5 more cars went in than left. So we need to add 5 to the current number of cars: 67 + 5 = 72 Therefore, there are 72 cars in the parking lot now. The answer is 72.\n\nQ: A park has three colors of flowering crepe myrtle trees planted: red, white, and pink. When they bloom, a third of them are pink, but only two are red. Most of them are white. There are 42 crepe myrtle trees in the park. How many have white flowers when they bloom?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that a third of the trees are pink. So, we can find the number of pink trees by dividing the total number of trees by 3: 42 \u00f7 3 = 14 So, there are 14 pink trees in the park. Next, we know that only two trees are red. So, we can subtract those from the total number of trees to find the number of white trees: 42 - 14 - 2 = 26 Therefore, there are 26 crepe myrtle trees with white flowers when they bloom. The answer is 26.\n\nQ: Jeremy decides to take Tylenol because of the pain he is experiencing. He decides to take 1000 mg every 6 hours for 2 weeks.  How many pills do they take if they are each 500 mg?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many hours are in two weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 14 days. Next, we need to figure out how many times Jeremy will take Tylenol in 2 weeks. If he takes it every 6 hours, that means he will take it 4 times a day (24 hours divided by 6 hours). So, in 2 weeks, he will take it 4 times a day for 14 days, which is a total of 56 times. Now we need to figure out how many milligrams of Tylenol he will take each time. He is taking 1000 mg each time, so we don't need to do any further calculations. Finally, we need to figure out how many pills he will take. Each pill is 500 mg, so he will need to take 2 pills each time. Therefore, over the course of 2 weeks, he will take 56 times 2 pills, which is a total of 112 pills. The answer is 112.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",

The town had a growth spurt and the population increased by 25% then they witnessed that 40% of the population moved away.  What is the current population?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people were added to the population when it increased by 25%. To do this, we can multiply the original population by 0.25: 684 x 0.25 = 171 So the population increased by 171 people, bringing the total population to: 684 + 171 = 855 Next, we need to find out how many people moved away when 40% of the population left. To do this, we can multiply the current population by 0.4: 855 x 0.4 = 342 So 342 people moved away, leaving the current population at: 855 - 342 = 513 Therefore, the current population of Youngsville is 513 people. The answer is 513.\n\nQ: Yvette wants to frame a new picture. When she goes to her local frame shop, she finds out that the frame she wanted is 20% more expensive than her budget of $60. If she paid for a smaller frame at 3/4 the new price of the frame she initially intended to buy, how much money did she remain with?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out the price of the frame Yvette initially intended to buy. We know that it is 20% more expensive than her budget of $60, so we can set up an equation: Price of initial frame = $60 + 20% of $60 Price of initial frame = $60 + $12 Price of initial frame = $72 Next, we need to find out the price of the smaller frame that Yvette ended up buying. We know that it is 3/4 the price of the initial frame, so we can set up another equation: Price of smaller frame = 3/4 x $72 Price of smaller frame = $54 Finally, we need to find out how much money Yvette remained with. We know that she initially had a budget of $60, but she ended up spending $54 on the smaller frame. So we can subtract the price of the smaller frame from her budget: Money Yvette remained with = $60 - $54 Money Yvette remained with = $6 Therefore, Yvette remained with $6 after buying the smaller frame. The answer is 6.\n\nQ: A 750 ml bottle of spirits costs $30.00 and has 16 servings per bottle.  Most restaurants will charge $8.00 for one serving.  How much money does a restaurant make on a bottle of spirits?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the cost per serving of the spirits. To do this, we divide the total cost of the bottle by the number of servings: $30.00 \u00f7 16 servings = $1.875 per serving Next, we need to find how much the restaurant charges per serving: $8.00 per serving Finally, we can calculate the profit the restaurant makes on a bottle of spirits by subtracting the cost per serving from the price charged per serving and then multiplying by the number of servings: ($8.00 per serving - $1.875 per serving) x 16 servings = $94.00 Therefore, the restaurant makes $94.00 on a bottle of spirits. The answer is 94.\n\nQ: Leticia, Nina, and Rosalie have a total of 25 people on their dance team. If 8 people quit, but 13 new people got in, how many people are there now on the team?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people were left on the team after 8 people quit. To do this, we can subtract 8 from the original total of 25: 25 - 8 = 17 So there were 17 people left on the team after 8 people quit. Next, we need to add the 13 new people who joined the team: 17 + 13 = 30 Therefore, there are now 30 people on the team. The answer is 30.\n\nQ: A local restaurant is offering an 8 piece fried chicken bucket and 2 sides for $12.00 that will feed 6 people.  If Monty was having a family reunion for 36 family members, how much will it cost him to buy enough chicken and sides to feed everyone one serving?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many servings of chicken and sides Monty needs to feed 36 people. Since the restaurant's 8 piece fried chicken bucket feeds 6 people, we can calculate that Monty needs 6 buckets of chicken to feed 36 people. Next, we need to figure out how many sides Monty needs. The restaurant offers 2 sides with each 8 piece chicken bucket, so Monty needs 6 x 2 = 12 sides. Now, we can calculate the total cost. Monty is paying $12.00 for 6 people, so he needs to pay 6/6 = 1 dollar per person. To feed 36 people, Monty needs to pay 36 x 1 = $36.00 for the chicken and sides. The answer is 36.\n\nQ: Larry jogs for 30 minutes each day. In the first week, he jogs for 3 days while he jogs for 5 days in the second week. How many hours does he jog in total for two weeks?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days Larry jogs in two weeks. Larry jogs for 3 days in the first week and 5 days in the second week, so he jogs for a total of 3 + 5 = 8 days in two weeks. Next, we need to find out how many hours Larry jogs in one day. Larry jogs for 30 minutes each day, which is equivalent to 0.5 hours. Finally, we can calculate how many hours Larry jogs in total for two weeks by multiplying the number of days by the number of hours per day: 8 days x 0.5 hours per day = 4 hours Therefore, Larry jogs for a total of 4 hours in two weeks. The answer is 4.\n\nQ: A school is planning a community outreach program. Each classroom must raise $200 for this activity. Classroom A has raised $20 from each of two families, $10 from each of eight families, and $5  from each of ten families. How much more money does Classroom A need in order to reach the goal?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total amount of money raised by Classroom A so far: - $20 x 2 = $40 (from two families) - $10 x 8 = $80 (from eight families) - $5 x 10 = $50 (from ten families) Total raised so far = $40 + $80 + $50 = $170 Next, let's calculate how much more money Classroom A needs to reach the goal: Goal amount = $200 Amount raised so far = $170 Amount needed to reach goal = Goal amount - Amount raised so far Amount needed to reach goal = $200 - $170 Amount needed to reach goal = $30 Therefore, Classroom A needs $30 more to reach the goal of raising $200 for the community outreach program. The answer is 200.\n\nQ: Heloise has dogs and cats in the ratio of 10:17, with the total number of pets being 189. If she gives 10 dogs to her friend Janet, how many dogs does she remain with altogether?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of pets that Heloise has. We know that the ratio of dogs to cats is 10:17, which means that for every 10 dogs, there are 17 cats. Let's call the number of dogs Heloise has \"10x\" and the number of cats \"17x\". So, the total number of pets is: 10x + 17x = 189 27x = 189 x = 7 This means that Heloise has 10x = 10(7) = 70 dogs and 17x = 17(7) = 119 cats. Now, if she gives 10 dogs to Janet, she will have: 70 - 10 = 60 dogs So, Heloise will have 60 dogs remaining altogether. The answer is 60.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
