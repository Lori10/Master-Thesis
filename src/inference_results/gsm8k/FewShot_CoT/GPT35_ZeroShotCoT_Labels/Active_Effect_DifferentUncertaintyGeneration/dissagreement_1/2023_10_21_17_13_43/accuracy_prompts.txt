To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\n\nQ: Jasper will serve charcuterie at his dinner party. He buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10, a pound of cream cheese that cost half the price of the cheddar cheese, and a pack of cold cuts that cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese. How much does he spend on the ingredients?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Jasper buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10, so the price per pound of cheddar cheese is $5 (10/2=5). Next, we know that the cream cheese costs half the price of the cheddar cheese, so it costs $2.50 (5/2=2.5). Finally, we know that the pack of cold cuts costs twice the price of the cheddar cheese, so it costs $10 x 2 = $20. To find the total cost of the ingredients, we add up the cost of each item: $10 (cheddar cheese) + $2.50 (cream cheese) + $20 (cold cuts) = $32.50 Therefore, Jasper spends $32.50 on the ingredients for his charcuterie. The answer is 32.\n\nQ: James decides to use tannerite to blow things up to reveal his baby's gender. The explosion ignites both his neighbors' houses and attracts a police officer, who arrests James on two count of arson, one count of manufacturing explosives, and one count of domestic terrorism. If the arson counts each carry a 6-year sentence, the explosives sentence is twice as long as the total arson sentence, and the domestic terrorism charge's sentence is 20 years, how long might James spend in jail?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total sentence for the arson counts. Since each count carries a 6-year sentence, the total sentence for both counts would be 6 years + 6 years = 12 years. Next, let's calculate the sentence for the explosives charge. We know that the explosives sentence is twice as long as the total arson sentence, which is 2 * 12 years = 24 years. Finally, let's calculate the sentence for the domestic terrorism charge, which is 20 years. To find the total sentence, we add up the sentences for each charge: 12 years + 24 years + 20 years = 56 years. Therefore, James might spend 56 years in jail. The answer is 56.\n\nQ: Kenneth has $50 to go to the store. Kenneth bought 2 baguettes and 2 bottles of water. Each baguette cost $2 and each bottle of water cost $1. How much money does Kenneth have left?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the total cost of the baguettes. Since Kenneth bought 2 baguettes and each baguette costs $2, the total cost of the baguettes is: 2 x $2 = $4 Next, let's calculate the total cost of the bottles of water. Since Kenneth bought 2 bottles of water and each bottle costs $1, the total cost of the bottles of water is: 2 x $1 = $2 Now, let's add the total cost of the baguettes and the total cost of the bottles of water to find the total cost of Kenneth's purchase: $4 + $2 = $6 Therefore, Kenneth spent $6 at the store. To find out how much money he has left, we need to subtract the total cost of his purchase from the amount of money he had to begin with: $50 - $6 = $44 So Kenneth has $44 left after his purchase. The answer is 44.\n\nQ: Delores has some money. She buys a computer for $400 and a printer for $40. If she has $10 left, how much money, in dollars, did Delores have at first?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total cost of the computer and printer. Total cost = $400 + $40 = $440 Next, we need to subtract the total cost from the amount of money Delores had at first to find out how much money she had before buying the computer and printer. Amount of money Delores had at first = Total cost + $10 Amount of money Delores had at first = $440 + $10 Amount of money Delores had at first = $450 Therefore, Delores had $450 at first. The answer is 450.\n\nQ: Melly's two cats each have litters of kittens at the same time. The first cat has 3 blue-eyed kittens and 7 brown-eyed kittens. The second cat has 4 blue-eyed kittens and 6 brown-eyed kittens. What percentage of all the kittens have blue eyes?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of kittens. The first cat has 3 + 7 = 10 kittens. The second cat has 4 + 6 = 10 kittens. So, the total number of kittens is 10 + 10 = 20. Next, we need to find the total number of blue-eyed kittens. The first cat has 3 blue-eyed kittens. The second cat has 4 blue-eyed kittens. So, the total number of blue-eyed kittens is 3 + 4 = 7. To find the percentage of kittens with blue eyes, we need to divide the number of blue-eyed kittens by the total number of kittens and then multiply by 100. 7/20 x 100 = 35 Therefore, 35% of all the kittens have blue eyes. The answer is 35.\n\nQ: Trevor buys three bouquets of carnations. The first included 9 carnations, and the second included 14 carnations. If the average number of carnations in the bouquets is 12, how many carnations were in the third bouquet?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of carnations in the first two bouquets. Total number of carnations in the first two bouquets = 9 + 14 = 23 Next, we can use the formula for finding the average: Average = (Total sum of items) / (Number of items) We know that the average number of carnations in the three bouquets is 12, and we already found the total number of carnations in the first two bouquets. So we can set up an equation: 12 = (23 + x) / 3 where x is the number of carnations in the third bouquet. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 36 = 23 + x Subtracting 23 from both sides, we get: x = 13 Therefore, there were 13 carnations in the third bouquet. The answer is 13.\n\nQ: Jason has a moray eel that eats 20 guppies a day and 5 betta fish who each eat 7 guppies a day. How many guppies per day does she need to buy?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many guppies the betta fish eat in total per day. Each betta fish eats 7 guppies a day, and there are 5 betta fish, so: 7 guppies/fish/day x 5 fish = 35 guppies/day Now we add the number of guppies the moray eel eats: 20 guppies/day (moray eel) + 35 guppies/day (betta fish) = 55 guppies/day Therefore, Jason needs to buy 55 guppies per day to feed all of his fish. The answer is 55.\n\nQ: The largest animal to have ever lived on earth is the blue whale.  The tongue of an adult blue whale can weigh 6000 pounds.  If one ton is 2000 pounds, how many tons can the tongue of an adult blue whale weigh?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the weight of the blue whale's tongue is 6000 pounds. To convert this to tons, we need to divide by 2000 (since one ton is 2000 pounds). So, 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/ton = 3 tons. Therefore, the tongue of an adult blue whale can weigh 3 tons. The answer is 3.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
