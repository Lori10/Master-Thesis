To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\n\nQ: A farmer owns a hog that recently gave birth to 6 piglets.  If the farmer raises the piglets until they are fully grown, he can sell the fully grown pig for $300.  Each piglet must grow for at least 12 months before it is large enough to be sold. It costs the farmer $10 per month to feed each animal until it is sold.  If the farmer sells 3 pigs after 12 months, and the remaining 3 pigs after 16 months, how much profit did he earn in total (after deducting the cost of food)?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe 3 pigs that are sold after 12 months will cost the farmer 12*10*3 = $<<12*10*3=360>>360 in food costs.\nThe 3 pigs that are sold after 16 months will cost the farmer 16*10*3 = $<<16*10*3=480>>480 in food costs.\nThus, the total food cost to raise the 6 piglets was 360 + 480 = $<<360+480=840>>840.\nNext, selling the 6 fully grown pigs will earn the farmer 6*300 = $<<6*300=1800>>1800 in revenue.\nTherefore, the earn the farmer 1800 - 840 = $<<1800-840=960>>960 in profit from these sales. The answer is 960.\n\nQ: Daisy and Rose were enjoying their backyard pool with their dogs.  If there are 24 legs/paws in the pool, how many dogs do Daisy and Rose have?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nDaisy and Rose each have 2 legs so between them, they have 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 legs\nThere are 24 legs in the pool and 4 belong to Daisy and Rose so there are 24-4 = <<24-4=20>>20 legs in the pool\nDogs have 4 legs and there are 20 legs in the pool so there are 20/4 = 5 dogs in the pool The answer is 5.\n\nQ: Some friends went hiking for 3.5 hours. They traveled 21 kilometers in that time. Birgit was 4 minutes/km faster than the average time. If Birgit kept the same pace, how many minutes would it take her to go 8 kilometers?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nMinutes spent hiking = 3.5*60 = <<3.5*60=210>>210 minutes\nAverage speed = 210 minutes/ 21 km = <<210/21=10>>10 minutes/km\nBirgit is 4 minutes/km faster = 10 - 4 = 6 min/km\nIt would take 6*8 = <<6*8=48>>48 minutes to go 8 km\nBirgit would take 48 minutes to travel 8 kilometers. The answer is 48.\n\nQ: To make fried green tomatoes, Thelma cuts each green tomato into 8 slices before cooking them up.  If 20 slices of fried green tomato make a meal for a single person, how many tomatoes will Thelma need to make enough fried green tomatoes to feed a family of 8 for a single meal?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nIf 20 slices are sufficient for a meal to feed a single person, then to feed eight Thelma will need 8*20=<<20*8=160>>160 slices of tomato.\nAt 8 slices per tomato, Thelma will need 160/8=<<160/8=20>>20 tomatoes to feed a family of 8. The answer is 20.\n\nQ: In ten years, I'll be twice my brother's age. The sum of our ages will then be 45 years old. How old am I now?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nLet X be my age now.\nIn ten years, I'll be X+<<+10=10>>10 years old.\nIn ten years, my brother will be (X+10)*1/2 years old.\nIn ten years, (X+10) + (X+10)*1/2 = 45.\nSo (X+10)*3/2 = 45.\nX+10 = 45 * 2/3 = 30.\nX = 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 years old. The answer is 20.\n\nQ: Giselle had 20 female doves in a birdhouse. After a month, the doves laid 3 eggs each. If 3/4 of the eggs hatched, calculate the total number of doves Giselle has now.\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nIf Giselle had 20 doves that laid 3 eggs each, the total number of eggs in the birdhouse is 20*3 = <<20*3=60>>60 eggs.\nIf 3/4 of the eggs hatched into birds, their total number is 3/4*60 = <<3/4*60=45>>45\nIn the birdhouse, there are 20 initial doves + 45 new squabs = <<20+45=65>>65 birds The answer is 65.\n\nQ: For his birthday, Geoffrey received clothes and money. His grandmother gave him \u20ac20, his aunt \u20ac25 and his uncle \u20ac30. With what he already had, he now has \u20ac125 in his wallet. He goes to a video game store and gets 3 games that cost 35 euros each. How much does he have left after this purchase?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nLet\u2019s calculate the total price of video games: 35\u20ac X 3\u20ac/game = <<35*3=105>>105\u20ac\nNow let\u2019s find out how much money Geoffrey has left by subtracting his spending from his starting amount of cash: 125\u20ac - 105\u20ac = <<125-105=20>>20\u20ac The answer is 20.\n\nQ: Maria wants to paint a picture and needs some tools to do that. She wants to buy a set of brushes for $20 and some canvas for three times more than the brushes. The paint costs Maria $8 per liter, and she needs at least 5 liters. How much money will she earn on the painting if she will be able to sell it for $200?\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nMaria wants to pay 3 * 20 = $<<3*20=60>>60 for the canvas.\nMaria needs 5 liters of paint, so the cost of it would be 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.\nSo in total Maria will earn 200 - 40 - 60 - 20 = $<<200-40-60-20=80>>80 if she will be able to sell the painting at the mentioned price. The answer is 80.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
