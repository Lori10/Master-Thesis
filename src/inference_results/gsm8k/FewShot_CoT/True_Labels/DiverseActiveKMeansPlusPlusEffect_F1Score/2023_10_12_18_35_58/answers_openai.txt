To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\n\nQ: The P.T.O. decided to provide shirts for the elementary students for track and field day. Each grade was given a different color. 101 Kindergartners wore orange shirts that cost $5.80 each. 113 first graders wore yellow shirts that cost $5 each. 107 second graders wore blue shirts that cost $5.60 each. 108 third graders wore green shirts that cost $5.25 each. How much did the P.T.O. spend on shirts for field day?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. The cost for 101 Kindergarten shirts x $5.80 = $<<101*5.80=585.80>>585.80. The cost for 113 first grade shirts x $5 = $<<113*5=565>>565. The cost for 107 second grade shirts x $5.60 = $<<107*5.60=599.20>>599.20. The cost for 108 third grade shirts x $5.25 = $<<108*5.25=567>>567. The total cost of the shirts was $585.80 + $565 + $599.20 + $567 = $<<585.8+565+599.2+567=2317>>2,317 The answer is 2317.\n\nQ: Trent caught 180 tadpoles then let 75% of them go. How many did he keep?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First find the number of tadpoles Trent released: 180 tadpoles * .75 = <<180*.75=135>>135 tadpoles Then subtract the number he let go from the total number to find the number of tadpoles he keeps: 180 tadpoles - 135 tadpoles = <<180-135=45>>45 tadpoles The answer is 45.\n\nQ: A train takes 4 hours to reach a destination at a speed of 50 miles per hour. How long would it take if it traveled at 100 miles per hour instead?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. The distance to the destination is 4 hours * 50 miles/hour = <<4*50=200>>200 miles. Traveling at 100 miles per hour, it will take 200 miles / (100 miles/hour) = <<200/(100)=2>>2 hours. The answer is 2.\n\nQ: Oliver had $9, then he saved $5 from his allowance and spent $4 on a frisbee and $3 on a puzzle. His friend gives him another $8 as it's his birthday. How much money does Oliver have left?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. The total amount of money saved is $9 + $5 = $<<9+5=14>>14. The total cost of the frisbee and the puzzle is $4 + $3 = $<<4+3=7>>7. So Oliver has $14 - $7 = $<<14-7=7>>7 left. His friend gives him $8, so now he has $7 + $8 = $<<7+8=15>>15. The answer is 15.\n\nQ: Luke started working on a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle. The first day he worked on it, he put together 10% of the pieces. On the second day, he put together another 20% of the remaining pieces from the first day. On the third day, he put together 30% of the remaining pieces from the previous day. How many pieces does he have left to complete after the third day?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Luke started putting together, 1000 x 0.1 = <<1000*0.1=100>>100 pieces. The next day, there were 1000-100 = <<1000-100=900>>900 pieces left. Then he put together 900 * 0.2 = <<900*0.2=180>>180 pieces on the second day. So there were 900 - 180 = <<900-180=720>>720 pieces left. On the third day, he put together 720 * 0.3 = <<720*0.3=216>>216 pieces. Therefore, Luke still has 720 - 216 = <<720-216=504>>504 pieces left to complete the puzzle. The answer is 504.\n\nQ: On Miss Lawrence's math exam, 80% of the 50 questions are problem-solving while the rest are multiple-choice questions. How many multiple-choice questions are there?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. 100% - 80% = 20% of Miss Lawrence's exam are multiple-choice questions. Thus, there are 50 x 20/100 = <<50*20/100=10>>10 multiple-choice questions. The answer is 10.\n\nQ: Every Monday to Friday morning, Alice walks 10 miles through a large grass field to get to school. To avoid the hot afternoon sun on her way home, she walks 12 miles through a forest. When she gets home on Friday, how many miles will she have walked that week?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. On Monday the total number of miles Alice walks to and from school is 10 + 12 = <<10+12=22>>22 miles. For the other 4 days, from Tuesday to Friday, she walks an additional 4 * 22 = <<4*22=88>>88 miles The total number of miles she will have walked by Friday 22 + 88 = <<22+88=110>>110 miles The answer is 110.\n\nQ: Sara and Joe have a combined height of 120 inches. Joe is 6 inches more than double Sara's height. How tall is Joe?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Let x be Sara's height in inches Joe is 6+2x inches tall 120=x+(6+2x) 120=3x+6 114=3x x=<<38=38>>38 inches Joe is 6+2(38)=82 inches The answer is 82.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
