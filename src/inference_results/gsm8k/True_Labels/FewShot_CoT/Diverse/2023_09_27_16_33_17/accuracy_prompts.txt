        "prompt": "You are an expert at arithmetic reasoning and are willing to solve grade school math problems. To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\nQ: Mary is trying to count the animals in the petting zoo, but they kept moving around so she double-counts 7 sheep and forgets to count 3 pigs. If Mary thinks there are 60 animals, how many are there really?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nFirst subtract the 7 double-counted animals from Mary's total: 60 animals - 7 animals = <<60-7=53>>53 animals\nThen add the animals she missed to find the real total: 53 animals + 3 pigs = <<53+3=56>>56 animals The answer is 56.\n\nQ: Bob started out the week with $80. On Monday alone, he spent half the money. On Tuesday, he spent one-fifth of the amount left from Monday. On Wednesday, he spent 3/8ths of the amount left from Tuesday. How much does he have left now?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nOn Monday, he spent half of $80 leaving him with $80-(1/2)*$80 = $<<80-(1/2)*80=40>>40\nOn Tuesday, he spent 1/5th of $40 leaving $40-(1/5)*40 = $<<40-(1/5)*40=32>>32\nOn Wednesday, he spent 3/8ths of $32 leaving $32-(3/8)*$32 = $20 The answer is 20.\n\nQ: Larry jogs for 30 minutes each day. In the first week, he jogs for 3 days while he jogs for 5 days in the second week. How many hours does he jog in total for two weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nLarry jogs for a total of 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 days.\nThus, he jogs a total of 8 x 30 = <<8*30=240>>240 minutes.\nThis is equal to 240/60 = <<240/60=4>>4 hours. The answer is 4.\n\nQ: Alexander is going food shopping. If he buys 5 apples for $1 each and 2 oranges for $2 each, how much does he spend?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nAlexander spends 5 * $1 = $<<5*1=5>>5 on apples.\nHe spends 2 * $2 = $<<2*2=4>>4 on oranges.\nIn total, he spends $5 + $4 = $<<5+4=9>>9. The answer is 9.\n\nQ: Kevin has been for a run and wants to calculate how far he traveled. He ran at 10 miles per hour for half an hour, 20 miles per hour for half an hour, then ran at 8 miles per hour for 15 minutes. How many miles has Kevin run?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nAt his first speed, Kevin ran 10 miles per hour * 0.5 hours = <<10*0.5=5>>5 miles.\nAt his second speed, he ran 20 miles per hour * 0.5 hours = <<20*0.5=10>>10 miles.\n15 minutes is a quarter of an hour so at his third speed, he ran 8 miles per hour * 0.25 hours = <<8*0.25=2>>2 miles.\nTherefore, Kevin ran a total of 5 miles + 10 miles + 2 miles = <<5+10+2=17>>17 miles. The answer is 17.\n\nQ: Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. If Mabel has 85 marbles, how many more marbles does Mabel have than Amanda?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nKatrina has 85/5 = <<85/5=17>>17 marbles.\nTwice as many marbles as Katrina is 17 x 2 = <<17*2=34>>34\nAmanda has 34 -12 = <<34-12=22>>22 marbles.\nMabel has 85 - 22 = <<85-22=63>>63 more marbles than Amanda The answer is 63.\n\nQ: Mary wants 144 cupcakes for her party. Mary has already made 36 cherry cupcakes, and 48 berry cupcakes. Mary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes for the rest. How much of each should she make?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nMary currently has 36 cherry + 48 berry cupcakes = <<36+48=84>>84 cupcakes.\nMary needs an additional 144 cupcakes \u2013 84 = <<144-84=60>>60 cupcakes.\nMary wants to split that number evenly between chocolate and vanilla, so 60 / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 cupcakes of each flavor. The answer is 30.\n\nQ: Ella has 4 bags with 20 apples in each bag and six bags with 25 apples in each bag. If Ella sells 200 apples, how many apples does Ella has left?\nA: Let's think step by step.\n4 bags have 4 x 20 = <<4*20=80>>80 apples.\nAnd, six bags have 6 x 25 = <<6*25=150>>150 apples.\nThus, Ella has 80 + 150 = <<80+150=230>>230 apples in all.\nTherefore, Ella has 230 - 200 = <<230-200=30>>30 apple left. The answer is 30.\n\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
