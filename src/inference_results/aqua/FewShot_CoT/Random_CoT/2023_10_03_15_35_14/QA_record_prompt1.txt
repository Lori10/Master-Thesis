            "Pred_Rationale": "The prime factorization of 7700 is 2^2 * 5^2 * 7 * 11. Since the GCF of the two integers is 11, one of the integers must be a multiple of 11. We are also given that one of the integers is 350. Thus, the other integer must have a prime factorization of the form 2^a * 5^b * 7^c * 11. We know that the LCM of the two integers is 7700, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n2^max(2,a) * 5^max(2,b) * 7^max(1,c) * 11^1 = 2^2 * 5^2 * 7 * 11\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n2^max(2,a) * 5^max(2,b) * 7^max(1,c) = 2^2 * 5^2\n\nSince the exponents on the left-hand side must be less than or equal to the exponents on the right-hand side, we know that a and b must both be less than or equal to 2. We also know that c must be less than or equal to 1, since the exponent on 7 is 1 in the prime factorization of 7700.\n\nWe are given that one of the integers is 350, which has a prime factorization of 2^1 * 5^2 * 7^1. Thus, the other integer must have a prime factorization of the form 2^a * 5^b * 11. Since a and b must both be less than or equal to 2, the only possible values for a and b are 1 and 2. We can try each of these values and see which one gives us an integer:\n\nIf a = 1 and b = 2, then the other integer has a prime factorization of 2^1 * 5^2 * 11, which is 550.\nIf a = 2 and b = 1, then the other integer has a prime factorization of 2^2 * 5^1 * 11, which is 220.\n\nThus, the other integer is 220. \n\nAnswer: D The answer is D.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "The merchant can take advantage of the discount if he pays within 30 days. The terms 4/30, n/100 mean that he can get a 4% discount if he pays within 30 days, or he can pay the full amount within n days. \n\nTo calculate the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money, we need to find out the cost of borrowing the money for n days. Let's assume that the merchant borrows the full amount of $20,000 and pays it back after n days. \n\nIf he takes the discount, he will pay 96% of the invoice amount, which is $20,000 x 0.96 = $19,200. \n\nIf he doesn't take the discount, he will pay the full amount of $20,000. \n\nThe cost of borrowing the money for n days is the difference between these two amounts. \n\nCost of borrowing = $20,000 - $19,200 = $800 \n\nThe interest rate is given by the formula: \n\nInterest = (Cost of borrowing / Principal) x (365 / n) x 100% \n\nWe want to find the highest interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow the money, so we need to solve for n. \n\nn = (Cost of borrowing / Principal) x (365 / Interest) \n\nn = ($800 / $20,000) x (365 / Interest) \n\nn = 0.04 x (365 / Interest) \n\nn = 14.6 / Interest \n\nThe merchant can afford to borrow the money if he can pay it back within n days. So, the highest interest rate at which he can afford to borrow the money is the interest rate that makes n an integer. \n\nLet's try the answer choices: \n\n(A) 247.67: n = 14.6 / 247.67 = 0.059, not an integer \n(B) 237.67: n = 14.6 / 237.67 = 0.061, not an integer \n(C) 227.67: n = 14.6 / 227.67 = 0.064, not an integer \n(D) 215.67: n = 14.6 / 215.67 = 0.068, not an integer \n(E) None of these \n\nNone of the answer choices make n an integer, so the answer is None of these.",

Since M is a three-digit number, we know that a is either 1, 2, or 3. We also know that a > c, so c can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. We can use the equation a + 3c = 10 to find all possible values of a and c:\n\na = 1, c = 3\na = 2, c = 2\na = 3, c = 1\n\nFor each of these values of a and c, we can find the corresponding value of b using the fact that M is a three-digit number:\n\na = 1, c = 3, b = 4 or 5\na = 2, c = 2, b = 1 or 3\na = 3, c = 1, b = 0 or 2\n\nSo there are a total of 6 values of M that are more than 300:\n\n143, 145, 241, 243, 340, 342\n\nAnswer: None of the above.",

In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 28 (C) 30 (D) 53 (E) 59",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's first find out how many times the number of water lilies will double from 1 to cover the lake and from 64 to cover the lake. \n\nFor the first case, we know that the number of water lilies doubles every two days. Let's say it doubles n times to cover the lake. Then we have:\n\n2^n = number of water lilies to cover the lake\n2^n = 2^60 (since it takes 60 days to cover the lake from 1 water lily)\nn = 60\n\nSo it takes 60/2 = 30 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies starting from 1 water lily.\n\nFor the second case, we know that there are already 64 water lilies on the lake. Let's say it doubles m times to cover the lake. Then we have:\n\n2^m = number of water lilies to cover the lake\n2^m = 2^x * 64 (where x is the number of times it doubles from 1 to 64)\n2^m = 2^(x+6)\nm = x+6\n\nWe know that it takes 60 days to cover the lake from 1 water lily. We can use this information to find x:\n\n2^x = number of water lilies after x days\n2^x = 2^(60/2) = 2^30\nx = 30\n\nSo the number of times it doubles from 1 to 64 is 30. Therefore, the number of times it doubles from 64 to cover the lake is:\n\nm = x+6 = 30+6 = 36\n\nSo it takes 36*2 = 72 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies starting from 64 water lilies.\n\nAnswer: None of the above.",

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nLet's denote the number of files infected only by a virus as V, the number of files infected only by a worm as W, and the number of files infected by both as B.\n\nWe know that:\n\nV + W + B = 250 (since all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both)\n\nW = 2.5B (since the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm)\n\nWe also know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, which means that the number of files infected by a virus is 50% of 250, or 125. Therefore:\n\nV + B = 125\n\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get:\n\nV + 2.5B + B = 250\n\nV + 3.5B = 250\n\nWe can substitute the third equation into this equation to get:\n\n125 + 3.5B = 250\n\n3.5B = 125\n\nB = 35.7 (rounded to the nearest tenth)\n\nSince B represents the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm, it must be a whole number. Therefore, we can round B up to 36 and use this value to find the other values:\n\nW = 2.5B = 2.5(36) = 90\n\nV + B = 125, so V = 125 - B = 125 - 36 = 89\n\nNow we can find the number of files that were not infected by a worm:\n\nNumber of files not infected by a worm = V = 89\n\nTherefore, the answer is D) 100.",

Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",

So, the volume of the coin is pi * (7.5mm)^2 * 2mm = 352.5 mm^3.\n\nLet x be the volume of aluminum in the coin. Since the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver, the volume of silver is also x. Therefore, the total weight of aluminum in the coin is x * 2.7 g/cm^3 (the density of aluminum) and the total weight of silver in the coin is x * 5.4 g/cm^3 (since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum).\n\nThe total weight of the coin is 30 grams, so we have:\n\nx * 2.7 g/cm^3 + x * 5.4 g/cm^3 = 30 g\nx * 8.1 g/cm^3 = 30 g\nx = 3.7 cm^3\n\nNow, let's find the volume of the pure aluminum coin.
