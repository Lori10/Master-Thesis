            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the number of members in the club be n. Then, the ages of the members form an arithmetic progression with first term 7 years and common difference 3 months, which is 1/4 years. \n\nThe sum of the ages of all the members is given by the formula: \n\nSum = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d] \n\nwhere a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms. \n\nSubstituting the given values, we get: \n\n250 = n/2 [2(7) + (n-1)(1/4)] \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n1000 = n[14 + (n-1)/4] \n\nMultiplying by 4 to eliminate the fraction, we get: \n\n4000 = 4n[14 + (n-1)/4] \n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get: \n\n4000 = n(4n + 54) \n\nRearranging, we get: \n\n4n^2 + 54n - 4000 = 0 \n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get: \n\nn = (-54 \u00b1 sqrt(54^2 + 4(4)(4000)))/(2(4)) \n\nn = (-54 \u00b1 sqrt(2916 + 64000))/8 \n\nn = (-54 \u00b1 sqrt(66916))/8 \n\nn = (-54 \u00b1 258)/8 \n\nn = 27 or -8 \n\nSince the number of members cannot be negative, the answer is: \n\nNumber of members in the club = 27 \n\nAnswer: E",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the cost of each brown sharpener be x. Then the cost of each white sharpener will be x+1. Total number of sharpeners is 18. So, we can write:\n\nNumber of brown sharpeners + Number of white sharpeners = 18\n\nWe can also write:\n\nx(Number of brown sharpeners) + (x+1)(Number of white sharpeners) = 100\n\nSimplifying the first equation, we get:\n\nNumber of brown sharpeners = 18 - Number of white sharpeners\n\nSubstituting this in the second equation, we get:\n\nx(18 - Number of white sharpeners) + (x+1)(Number of white sharpeners) = 100\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx + Number of white sharpeners = 10\n\nWe know that x is an integer, so the only possible values for x are 1, 2, 3, or 4. We can try each of these values and see which one gives us a whole number for Number of white sharpeners:\n\nIf x = 1, then Number of white sharpeners = 9. This gives us a cost of 9(2) + 9(1) = 27 + 9 = 36 for white sharpeners and a cost of 9(1) = 9 for brown sharpeners. Total cost is 36 + 9 = 45, which is not equal to 100.\n\nIf x = 2, then Number of white sharpeners = 8. This gives us a cost of 8(2) + 8(1) = 24 + 8 = 32 for white sharpeners and a cost of 10(2) = 20 for brown sharpeners. Total cost is 32 + 20 = 52, which is not equal to 100.\n\nIf x = 3, then Number of white sharpeners = 7.

Total cost is 28 + 33 = 61, which is not equal to 100.\n\nIf x = 4, then Number of white sharpeners = 6. This gives us a cost of 6(4) + 6(1) = 24 + 6 = 30 for white sharpeners and a cost of 12(4) = 48 for brown sharpeners. Total cost is 30 + 48 = 78, which is not equal to 100.\n\nTherefore, there is no solution for this problem. The answer is None of the above.",

So, the length of each part is (48/2) - b = 24 - b. \n\nWhen folded along the breadth, the perimeter of each part is 66cm. So, the breadth of each part is (66/2) - l = 33 - l. \n\nNow, we know that the length of each part is equal.

Let the distance between A and B be D and the distance between the point of intersection and A be x. Then, we have:\n\nD - x = speed of M * time taken by M\nx = speed of N * time taken by N\n\nWe know that the speed of M is greater than the speed of N, so train M covers more distance than train N before they meet. We also know that train M travels for 4 hours and train N travels for 3.5 hours. Therefore, we can write:\n\nD - x = speed of M * 4\nx = speed of N * 3.5\n\nAdding the two equations, we get:\n\nD = speed of M * 4 + speed of N * 3.5\n\nNow, we can substitute the values given in the problem to get:\n\nD = 4 * speed of M\nD = 3.5 * speed of N\nD = distance between A and B = 2 * distance between point of intersection and midpoint of AB\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n4 * speed of M = 3.5 * speed of N\n2 * distance between point of intersection and midpoint of AB = distance between A and B\n\nSolving for speed of M, we get:\n\nspeed of M = (3.5/4) * speed of N\n\nSubstituting this in the equation for the distance between point of intersection and midpoint of AB, we get:\n\n2 * distance between point of intersection and midpoint of AB = (7/8) * distance between A and B\n\nNow, we can use the formula:\n\ntime = distance/speed\n\nto find the time taken by train M to travel from A to the point of intersection:\n\ntime = (7/8) * distance between A and B / speed of M\ntime = (7/8) * distance between A and B / ((3.5/4) * speed of N)\n\nSubstituting the values given in the problem, we get:\n\ntime = (7/8) * 2 * distance between point of intersection and midpoint of AB / ((3.5/4) * speed of N)\ntime = (7/8) * 2 * (distance between A and B / 2) / ((3.5/4) * speed of N)\ntime = (7/8) * (distance between A and B) / ((3.5/4) * speed of N)\n\nNow, we can find the time taken by train N to travel from B to the point of intersection:\n\ntime = distance between point of intersection and B / speed of N\ntime = (1/2) * distance between A and B / speed of N\n\nAdding the two times, we get the total time taken for the trains to meet:\n\ntotal time = (7/8) * (distance between A and B) / ((3.5/4) * speed of N) + (1/2) * distance between A and B / speed of N\n\nSubstituting the values given in the problem, we get:\n\ntotal time = (7/8) * 624 / ((3.5/4) * speed of N) + (1/2) * 624 / speed of N\ntotal time = (7/8) * 624 / ((3.5/4) * 70) + (1/2) * 624 / 70\ntotal time = 1.25 + 4.2\ntotal time = 5.45 hours\n\nTherefore, the two trains cross each other at 10:45 am, which is 5 hours and 45 minutes after 5 am.

We can represent the 10 types of books with 3 letters as follows: \n\n- Choose 2 letters out of 26 for the first pair (325 choices)\n- Choose 1 letter out of the remaining 24 letters for the third letter (24 choices)\n\nThis gives us a total of 325*24 = 7800 codes, which is more than enough to represent 10 types of books.",

What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount? Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The merchant can take advantage of the discount if he pays within 30 days. So, he has to pay 96% of the invoice amount within 30 days. That is, he has to pay $20,000 x 0.96 = $19,200 within 30 days. \n\nIf he borrows money to pay this amount, he has to pay back the principal plus interest. Let the principal be P and the interest rate be r. Then, the amount he has to pay back after n days is given by:\n\nP + Prn/36500\n\nwhere n is the number of days and 36500 is the number of days in 100 years. \n\nHe has to pay back $19,200 if he borrows money. So, we have:\n\nP + Prn/36500 = 19,200\n\nSolving for P, we get:\n\nP = 19,200 - Prn/36500\n\nNow, we want to find the highest interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money. This means we want to find the highest value of r such that P is non-negative. \n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nP = 19,200 - Prn/36500\nP = 19,200 - Pr(30)/365\nP = 19,200 - 0.8219P\n\nSolving for P, we get:\n\nP = $10,909.09\n\nSo, the merchant can afford to borrow up to $10,909.09. The interest he has to pay is:\n\nI = Prn/36500\nI = 0.04 x $10,909.09 x 70/36500\nI = $8.40\n\nTherefore, the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money is:\n\nr = I/P x 100%\nr = $8.40/$10,909.09 x 100%\nr = 0.077 x 100%\nr = 7.7%\n\nAnswer: None of the above (the closest option is D, but it is not the correct answer)",

So, the bag now has Q-19 white marbles and 21 black marbles. \n\nWe know that the percentage of black marbles pulled out in the second draw represents their percentage in the bag. \n\nSo, (21/(Q-19)+21)*100 = 1/20 * 100 \n\nSolving this equation, we get Q = 400 \n\nAnswer: D) 400",

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's start by using a Venn diagram to represent the information given in the problem. \n\nLet's assume that the number of files infected only by a virus is V, the number of files infected only by a worm is W, and the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is VW. \n\nFrom the problem, we know that: \n\n- V + W + VW = 250 (since all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both)\n- W = 2.5V (since the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm)\n\nWe want to find the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm. Let's call this number X. \n\nFrom the problem, we know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. This means that V = 0.5(250) = 125. \n\nWe can use this information to find W and VW: \n\n- W = 2.5V = 2.5(125) = 312.5\n- VW = V + W + VW - (V + W + VW) = 250 - (V + W + VW) = 250 - (125 + 312.5 + VW) = -187.5 - VW\n\nWe have a problem here. VW cannot be negative. This means that our assumption that X represents the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm is incorrect. We need to adjust our approach. \n\nLet's instead try to find the number of files that were infected by a worm. Let's call this number Y. \n\nFrom the problem, we know that: \n\n- V + W + VW = 250 (since all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both)\n- W = 2.5V (since the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm)\n- V = 0.5(250) = 125 (since 50% of the files were not infected by a virus)\n\nWe can use this information to find Y and VW: \n\n- Y = W + VW = 2.5V + VW = 2.5(125) + VW = 312.5 + VW\n- VW = V + W + VW - (V + W + VW) = 250 - (V + W + VW) = 250 - (125 + 312.5 + Y) = -187.5 - Y\n\nAgain, we have a problem.
