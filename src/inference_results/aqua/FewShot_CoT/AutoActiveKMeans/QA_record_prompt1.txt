Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 95 (C) 110 (D) 125 (E) 140\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe range of the other 8 numbers is 170-90 = 80, so x must be either the smallest number or the largest number in the set.\nThen x = 170-90 = 80 or x = 90+90 = 180\nThe answer is A. The answer is A.\n\nQ: the government was giving out 10500 after 6 years of living in the United States and 15500 after 12 years of living in the United Sates. how much is the interest per year. Answer Choices: (A) 12% (B) 20% (C) 15% (D) 10% (E) 5%\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nfor 6 years = (15500 - 10500) = 5000.\nfor 12 years = (5000x6)/6= 5000\nPrincipal = (10500 - 5000) = 5500.\nHence, rate = (100 x 5000)/(5500x6)\t% = 15% ANSWER :C The answer is C.\n\nQ: Three friends-whose walking rates are 1 ft./sec., 3ft./sec.,and 6ft./sec. start together walking in the same direction around a circular track that is 420 feet in circumference.After how many minutes are the three of them together again?

            "Question": "Q: An exam is given in a certain class. The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers? Answer Choices: (A) (zy \u2013 2x) /z (B) (zy \u2013 2) /z (C) (zx \u2013 y) /(z \u2013 2)  (D) (zy \u2013 2x) /(z -2)  (E) (zy \u2013 x) /(z + 2) ",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the highest score be H and the lowest score be L. Then we know that:\n\n(H + L)/2 = x  --> H + L = 2x\nAnd the average score for the entire class is:\n\n(y*z) = sum of all scores\nWe want to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, which we can call A. We know that A is the sum of all scores excluding H and L, divided by the number of students excluding the highest and lowest scorers, which is z-2. So:\n\nA = (sum of all scores - H - L)/(z-2)\nWe can substitute the first equation into this to get:\n\nA = ((y*z) - (H + L))/(z-2)\nA = ((y*z) - 2x)/(z-2)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) (zy \u2013 2x) /(z -2).",

Then the perimeter is 4.\n\nTo find the total time, we need to calculate the time it takes to travel each side. We can use the formula:\n\ntime = distance / speed\n\nFor the first side, the distance is 1 and the speed is 200, so the time is 1/200.\n\nFor the second side, the distance is 1 and the speed is 400, so the time is 1/400.\n\nFor the third side, the distance is 1 and the speed is 600, so the time is 1/600.\n\nFor the fourth side, the distance is 1 and the speed is 800, so the time is 1/800.\n\nThe total time is the sum of these times:\n\ntotal time = 1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800\n\nWe can simplify this expression by finding a common denominator:\n\ntotal time = (4/2400) + (3/2400) + (2/2400) + (3/2400)\ntotal time = 12/2400\ntotal time = 1/200\n\nNow we can find the average speed:\n\naverage speed = total distance / total time\naverage speed = 4 / (1/200)\naverage speed = 800\n\nAnswer: The average speed of the plane around the field is 800 km/hr.

We can write:\n\nx = 11 * a\n\nwhere a is some positive integer. Now we can use the fact that the least common multiple of 350 and x is 7700.

What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount? Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The merchant can take advantage of the discount if he pays within 30 days. The amount he needs to pay within 30 days is 96% of the invoice amount, which is 0.96*20000 = 19200.\nIf he borrows money to pay within 30 days, he needs to pay back the borrowed amount plus the interest within 30 days. Let's say he borrows x dollars. Then he needs to pay back x + i dollars within 30 days, where i is the interest he needs to pay.\nHe can afford to borrow money if the interest he needs to pay is less than the discount he gets. The discount he gets is 20000 - 19200 = 800 dollars.\nSo, x + i - 19200 = 800\ni = 800 - x + 19200\nThe interest rate he can afford to pay depends on the number of days for which he borrows the money. Let's say he borrows the money for n days after the discount period. Then the interest he needs to pay is given by the simple interest formula:\ni = (x*r*n)/36500\nwhere r is the interest rate per day.\nSubstituting the expression for i in terms of x in the above equation, we get:\n(x*r*n)/36500 = 800 - x + 19200\nxrn = 36500(800 - x + 19200)\nxrn = 36500*20000 - 36500x\nrn = 73000 - 36500(x/n)\nThe highest interest rate he can afford to pay is when x/n is minimum. The minimum value of x/n occurs when x is minimum. The minimum value of x occurs when he borrows the minimum amount he needs to pay within 30 days, which is 19200. So, x = 19200.\nSubstituting x = 19200 in the above equation, we get:\nrn = 73000 - 36500(19200/n)\nrn = 36500(2 - 19200/n)\nTo maximize the interest rate, we need to minimize the value of n. The minimum value of n is 1, because he needs to borrow the money for at least one day after the discount period. Substituting n = 1 in the above equation, we get:\nr = (73000 - 36500(2 - 19200))/36500\nr = 0.021767\nThe highest interest rate he can afford to pay is 0.021767*365 = 7.94%\nAnswer: None of the above.",

So, the total number of black marbles in the bag became 21.\nNow, we can set up an equation to solve for Q:\n(21/(Q+20))*100 = 5\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\nQ+20 = 420\nQ = 400\nTherefore, the bag currently holds a total of Q = 400 marbles.\nAnswer: D The answer is D.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "The volume of the coin is the volume of a cylinder with height 2mm and radius 7.5mm (half of the diameter). Hence, the volume of the coin is:\n\nV = \u03c0r^2h = \u03c0(7.5mm)^2(2mm) = 281.25mm^3\n\nLet x be the volume of aluminum in the coin. Then the volume of silver in the coin is also x. Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of the silver in the coin is twice the weight of the aluminum in the coin. Hence, the weight of the coin is:\n\nweight = 2x\u03c1_aluminum + 4x\u03c1_aluminum = 6x\u03c1_aluminum\n\nwhere \u03c1_aluminum is the density of aluminum.
