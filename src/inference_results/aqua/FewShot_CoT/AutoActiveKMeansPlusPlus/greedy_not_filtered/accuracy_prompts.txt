        "prompt": "You are an expert at arithmetic reasoning and are willing to solve algebraic word problems. Select the correct answer from the given options. If none of the options are correct, generate 'None of the above'. To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\n\nQ: A can complete a project in 20 days and B can complete the same project in 30 days. If A and B start working on the project together and A quits 15 days before the project is completed, in how many days total will the project be completed? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 21 (C) 24 (D) 27 (E) 30\n\nA: Let's think step by step. A's rate is 1/20 of the project per day. B's rate is 1/30 of the project per day. The combined rate is 1/12 of the project per day. In the last 15 days, B can do 1/2 of the project. Thus A and B must complete 1/2 of the project, which takes 6 days. The total number of days is 6 + 15 = 21. The answer is B. The answer is B.\n\nQ: A jar full of whisky contains 40% alcohol. A part of this whisky is replaced by another containg 19% alcohol and now the percentage of alcohol was found to be 22%. What quantity of whisky is replaced ? Answer Choices: (A) 1/3 (B) 2/3 (C) 2/5 (D) 3/5 (E) 4/5\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Let us assume the total original amount of whiskey = 10 ml ---> 4 ml alcohol and 6 ml non-alcohol. Let x ml be the amount removed ---> total alcohol left = 4-0.4x New quantity of whiskey added = x ml out of which 0.19 is the alcohol. Thus, the final quantity of alcohol = 4-0.4x+0.19x ----> (4-0.21x)/ 10 = 0.26 ---> x = 20/3 ml. Per the question, you need to find the x ml removed as a ratio of the initial volume ---> (20/3)/10 = 3/5. Hence, D is the correct answer. The answer is D.\n\nQ: Shawn invested one half of his savings in a bond that paid simple interest for 2 years (20% per anum) and received $600 as interest. He invested the remaining in a bond that paid compound interest, interest being compounded annually, for the same 2 years at the same rate of interest and received $655 as interest. What was the value of his total savings before investing in these two bonds? Answer Choices: (A) 3000 (B) 5000 (C) 6000 (D) 8000 (E) 9000\n\nA: Let's think step by step. So, we know that Shawn received 20% of the amount he invested in a year. We also know that in one year Shawn received $300, thud 0.2x = $300 --> x = $1,500. Since, he invested equal sums in his 2 bonds, then his total savings before investing was 2*$1,500 = $3,000. Answer: A The answer is A.\n\nQ: If the range of the set of numbers {150, 90, 125, 110, 170, 155, x, 100, 140} is 90, which of the following could be x? Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 95 (C) 110 (D) 125 (E) 140\n\nA: Let's think step by step. The range of the other 8 numbers is 170-90 = 80, so x must be either the smallest number or the largest number in the set. Then x = 170-90 = 80 or x = 90+90 = 180 The answer is A. The answer is A.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
