If none of the options are correct, generate 'None of the above'. To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\n\nQ: Which of the following is the lowest positive integer that is divisible by 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11? Answer Choices: (A) 27,720 (B) 29,940 (C) 31,960 (D) 33,970 (E) 35,890\n\nA: Let's think step by step. To find the lowest positive integer that is divisible by 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. First, we can simplify 8 to 2^3 and 9 to 3^2. The prime factorization of each number is: 7 = 7 2^3 = 8 3^2 = 9 10 = 2 x 5 11 = 11 To find the LCM, we need to take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers. The LCM of these numbers is: 7 x 2^3 x 3^2 x 5 x 11 = 27,720 Therefore, the answer is (A) 27,720. The answer is A.\n\nQ: The percentage profit earned by selling an article for Rs. 1920 is equal to the percentage loss incurred by selling the same article for Rs. 1280. At what price should the article be sold to make 25% profit? Answer Choices: (A) 3000 (B) 1230 (C) 2000 (D) 5600 (E) 3400\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the cost price of the article be x. Given, percentage profit earned by selling the article for Rs. 1920 = percentage loss incurred by selling the same article for Rs. 1280. Profit% = Loss% Profit% = (C.P - S.P)/C.P * 100 Loss% = (C.P - S.P)/C.P * 100 Therefore, (x - 1920)/x * 100 = (x - 1280)/x * 100 Solving this equation, we get x = 3200. To make a 25% profit, the selling price should be (125/100) * 3200 = Rs. 4000. Hence, the correct answer is (None of the above). The answer is C.\n\nQ: Two trains each 250 m in length are running on the same parallel lines in opposite directions with the speed of 80 kmph and 70 kmph respectively. In what time will they cross each other completely? Answer Choices: (A) 19 sec (B) 22 sec (C) 12 sec (D) 42 sec (E) 32 sec\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speeds from kmph to m/s. Speed of first train = 80 kmph = (80 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 22.22 m/s Speed of second train = 70 kmph = (70 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 19.44 m/s Now, we need to find the relative speed of the two trains. Relative speed = (Speed of first train + Speed of second train) = (22.22 + 19.44) m/s = 41.66 m/s The total distance to be covered by the two trains to cross each other completely is the sum of their lengths, which is 250 + 250 = 500 m. Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed Time = 500 / 41.66 Time = 12 sec Therefore, the answer is (C) 12 sec. The answer is C.\n\nQ: What are the number of ways to select 3 men and 2 women such that one man and one woman are always selected? Answer Choices: (A) 26 ways (B) 19 ways (C) 30 ways (D) 76 ways (E) 15 ways\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to select one man from the available men, which can be done in C(3,1) ways. Then, we need to select one woman from the available women, which can be done in C(2,1) ways. Next, we need to select the remaining 1 man and 1 woman from the remaining pool of men and women. This can be done in C(2,1) * C(1,1) ways. Therefore, the total number of ways to select 3 men and 2 women such that one man and one woman are always selected is: C(3,1) * C(2,1) * C(2,1) * C(1,1) = 3 * 2 * 2 * 1 = 12 ways None of the answer choices match the correct answer of 12 ways. The answer is C.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step."

Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A be E and A, respectively. From the given information, we know that 1 gram of the health food contains 0.09E units of vitamin E and 0.08A units of vitamin A. To obtain at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to eat x grams of the health food daily, where: 0.09E x >= E (minimum daily requirement of vitamin E) 0.08A x >= A (minimum daily requirement of vitamin A) Solving these inequalities, we get: x >= E / 0.09E x >= A / 0.08A We need to take the larger value of x to ensure that both minimum daily requirements are met. Therefore, x = max(E / 0.09E, A / 0.08A) Let's assume that E = 100 units and A = 125 units. Then, x = max(100 / 0.09(100), 125 / 0.08(125)) = max(111.11, 156.25) = 156.25 grams.

Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's first find out how long it takes Jack to complete the entire work. If he can clean a yacht in 12 hours, then he can clean 1/12th of the yacht in 1 hour. Let the total work be W. Therefore, W/12 is the work done by Jack in 1 hour. Now, Jack completes two-thirds of the work. Therefore, the remaining one-third of the work is left. Let the remaining work be R. Therefore, R = W/3. Now, Jill completes the remaining work. Her rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. Therefore, her rate of cleaning is 5/100 * (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht per hour. Let the time taken by Jill to complete the remaining work be T. Therefore, the work done by Jill in T hours is (R/T). Now, we know that Jack has completed two-thirds of the work. Therefore, the work done by Jack is (2/3)W. Therefore, the work left to be done is W - (2/3)W = (1/3)W = R. Now, we can use the fact that the total work done is equal to the sum of the work done by Jack and the work done by Jill. Therefore, we have: (2/3)W + (R/T) = W Dividing both sides by W, we get: (2/3) + (R/TW) = 1 (R/TW) = (1/3) T = R / (1/3)T = (W/3) / (1/3)T = W/T Therefore, T = W/R = 12 / (1/3) = 36 hours.

We are given that the profit earned after a discount of 7% is Rs. 15 less than the profit earned after a discount of 5%. Let the profit earned after a discount of 5% be y. Then, the profit earned after a discount of 7% is y - 15. We know that profit = selling price - cost price. Therefore, we can write two equations: y = 0.95x - cost price y - 15 = 0.93x - cost price Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get: 15 = 0.02x x = 750 Therefore, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750.

Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the cost price of each pen be x. The company estimates an overall profit of 25%, which means the selling price of each pen is 1.25x. The company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each, which means the revenue earned by the company is 7200 x 10 = 72000. However, 10% of the produced pens are defective and are rejected before packing. Therefore, the company needs to produce more pens to meet the order of 7200 pens. Let the number of pens produced be y. Then, the number of non-defective pens produced is 0.9y. The cost of producing y pens is xy. The cost of producing 0.9y non-defective pens is 0.9xy. The revenue earned by selling 0.9y pens at Rs. 10 each is 0.9y x 10 = 9y. The profit earned by the company is the revenue earned minus the cost of production, which is: 9y - (xy + 0.9xy) = 0.1xy + 9y = 1.1xy The profit earned is 25% of the selling price, which is 0.25(1.25x) = 0.3125x. Therefore, we have the equation: 0.3125x = 1.1xy / 7200 Solving for x, we get: x = 7.2 Therefore, the manufactured cost of each pen is Rs. 7.2. Hence, the correct answer is (B) Rs. 7.2.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the combined rate of painting of all three painters. Let the total work be 1 (painting 1 house). Then, the rate of Mr.Brown = 1/6, the rate of Mr.Black = 1/8, and the rate of Mr.Blue = 1/12. Therefore, the combined rate of all three painters = 1/6 + 1/8 + 1/12 = 11/24. Now, we need to find the work done by all three painters in the first 8 days. Let the work done by all three painters in 8 days be x. Then, using the combined rate of all three painters, we can write: x * (11/24) * 8 = 8 (since they work for 8 days) Solving this equation, we get x = 24/11.

Answer Choices: (A) 43 seconds (B) 39 seconds (C) 20 seconds (D) 33 seconds (E) 55 seconds",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to convert the speed of the train from miles per hour to miles per second. 120 miles per hour is equal to 120/3600 miles per second (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour). Simplifying, we get 1/30 miles per second. \n\nNext, we need to find the length of the tunnel in miles. Since the tunnel is 1 mile long, its length is 1 mile. \n\nNow, we can use the formula: \n\nTime = Length / Speed \n\nPlugging in the values, we get: \n\nTime = 1 / (1/30) \n\nTime = 30 seconds \n\nHowever, the question asks for the time it takes for the train to completely pass through the tunnel, which is twice the time it takes for the train to enter the tunnel. Therefore, the answer is: \n\n2 x 30 seconds = 60 seconds \n\nNone of the answer choices match the correct answer of 60 seconds. The answer is None of the above.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can use the concept of similar triangles to solve this problem. The ratio of the height of the shorter ant to the length of its shadow is 4/10 = 2/5. The ratio of the height of the taller ant to the length of its shadow is x/y, where x is the length of the shadow and y is the height of the ant. Since the two ants are standing side-by-side, their shadows are being cast by the same light source and are therefore parallel. This means that the two triangles formed by the ants and their shadows are similar. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion: 2/5 = 6/x Solving for x, we get: x = (5/2) * 6 = 15 Therefore, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts is 15 inches. Hence, the correct answer is (D) 15. The answer is D.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the rate of interest be R%. Then, using the formula for simple interest, we have: Simple Interest = (P * R * T) / 100 = (5000 * R * 2) / 100 = 100R Similarly, using the formula for compound interest, we have: Compound Interest = P[(1 + R/100)^T - 1] = 5000[(1 + R/100)^2 - 1] Now, we are given that the difference between compound interest and simple interest is Rs. 72. Therefore, we have: Compound Interest - Simple Interest = 72 5000[(1 + R/100)^2 - 1] - 100R = 72 Simplifying this equation, we get: 50[(1 + R/100)^2 - 1] - R/2 = 1.44 Now, we can solve this equation using approximation or numerical methods to get R. One possible method is to use the trial and error method. We can start with option (A) 10% and check if it satisfies the equation. If it doesn't, we can move on to the next option and repeat the process until we find the correct answer. Using this method, we find that option (B) 12% satisfies the equation.

            "Pred_Rationale": "+45 and -30 are two integers with different signs. To add them, we need to subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute value and keep the sign of the larger absolute value. In this case, the absolute value of -30 is smaller than the absolute value of +45.

Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that Alex and Jacob made x and y toys respectively. We know that they made a total of 35 toys. Therefore, x + y = 35. We also know that Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. Let's assume that Alex worked for a total of a hours and Jacob worked for a total of b hours. Since both of them worked for almost similar number of hours, we can assume that a is approximately equal to b. We can use the formula: Efficiency = Output / Time taken Therefore, Alex's efficiency = x / a and Jacob's efficiency = y / b We know that their combined efficiency is 35 / (a + b). Therefore, we can write: x / a + y / b = 35 / (a + b) Multiplying both sides by ab(a + b), we get: bx + ay = 35ab Now, we can substitute x = 35 - y in the above equation to get: b(35 - y) + ay = 35ab Solving for y, we get: y = (35b) / (2a + 3b) Since a is approximately equal to b, we can assume that 2a + 3b is approximately equal to 5a. Therefore, y is approximately equal to (35b) / 5a = (7b) / a. Since Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, we can assume that their average time taken is approximately 8 hours. Therefore, a and b are approximately equal to 8x and 8y respectively. Substituting these values in the above equation, we get: y = (7b) / a = (7b) / (8x) = (7/8) * (y / 35) * 35 = (7/8) * 35 = 30.625 Since y represents the number of toys made by Jacob, we can round off the answer to the nearest integer to get: y = 31.

Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The yearly profit required is $626,400. We know that the company produces 420 units every month, so the total production cost per year is: 420 * 12 * $110 = $554,400. To make a profit of $626,400 - $554,400 = $72,000 per year, the total revenue from selling the components should be: $554,400 + $72,000 = $626,400. The revenue per component is the selling price, so we need to find the minimum selling price per component that will give us a revenue of $626,400. The total number of components produced per year is: 420 * 12 = 5,040. Therefore, the minimum selling price per component is: $626,400 / 5,040 = $124.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet be l and b respectively. When folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm. This means that the length of each part is (48/2) - b = 24 - b. Similarly, the breadth of each part is (48/2) - l = 24 - l. When folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm. This means that the length of each part is (66/2) - b = 33 - b. Similarly, the breadth of each part is (66/2) - l = 33 - l. Now, we can set up two equations based on the above information: 2(24 - b) + 2l = 48 2(33 - b) + 2l = 66 Simplifying these equations, we get: l + b = 24 l + b = 33 Solving these equations, we get l = 9 and b = 15. Therefore, the area of the rectangular sheet is l * b = 9 * 15 = 135 sq. cm. However, this is the area of the unfolded sheet. When folded into two equal halves, the area of each part is half of the total area. Therefore, the area of each part is (135/2) sq. cm. Hence, the correct answer is (E) 1200.",

Now, let's find the time taken by train N to travel from City B to the point where the two trains meet. Train N takes 3.5 hours to travel from City B to City A. Let the speed of train N be y kmph. Then, we have: d = 3.5y. Since the two trains meet at the same point, we have: 4x = 3.5y. To find the time at which the two trains meet, we need to find the time taken by train M to travel from City A to the point where the two trains meet. This is given by: t = d/x = (4x)/x = 4 hours.

Therefore, the time taken by him to travel one way by car is (x-4) hours (as he loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train). Total time taken by Mr. Sam to go by train to the city and return by car = 17 hours. Therefore, we can write the equation: 2x + (x-4) = 17 Solving this equation, we get x = 7. Therefore, the time taken by Mr. Sam to travel one way by car is (7-4) = 3 hours. Hence, the time taken by him to travel both ways by car is 2*3 = 6 hours.

The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train? Answer Choices: (A) 0.9 (B) 0.8 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.65 (E) 1.5",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The first train that comes can be either from the main line or the harbor line. The time difference between the start of the main line service and the harbor line service is 2 minutes. Therefore, the first train from the harbor line will arrive 2 minutes later than the first train from the main line. \n\nLet's consider the time intervals between the arrivals of the trains. The time interval between the arrivals of the main line trains is 10 minutes. The time interval between the arrivals of the harbor line trains is also 10 minutes. However, the first harbor line train arrives 2 minutes later than the first main line train. \n\nTherefore, the time intervals between the arrivals of the first main line train and the first harbor line train, the second main line train and the second harbor line train, and so on, are all the same and equal to 10 minutes. \n\nLet's consider the time slots between 5:00 A.M. and 6:00 A.M. There are 60 minutes in this time period. The first main line train arrives at 5:00 A.M. The second main line train arrives at 5:10 A.M. The third main line train arrives at 5:20 A.M. and so on. \n\nThe first harbor line train arrives at 5:02 A.M. The second harbor line train arrives at 5:12 A.M.

If there is one water lily initially and it doubles every two days, then after 60 days, the number of water lilies will be 2^30 (doubling 30 times). Similarly, if there are 64 water lilies initially, then the lake will be fully covered when the number of water lilies reaches 2^6 * 64 = 4096. Let's say it takes n days for the number of water lilies to reach 4096. Then, we can write: 64 * 2^(n/2) = 4096 Dividing both sides by 64, we get: 2^(n/2) = 64 Rearranging, we get: 2^(n/2) = 2^6 Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get: n/2 = 6 n = 12 Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with water lilies in 12 days if initially there were 64 water lilies on it.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The length of each picket is 1/2 inch. The length of space between each pair of pickets is 6 inches. Therefore, the length of each section of the fence (one picket and the space next to it) is 1/2 + 6 = 13/2 inches. To find the length of x pickets and x-1 spaces, we can use the formula: Length = (Number of sections) x (Length of each section) Number of sections = x (number of pickets) + (x-1) (number of spaces) = 2x - 1 Length of each section = 13/2 inches = 13/24 feet Therefore, Length = (2x - 1) x (13/24) = (13x - 13)/24 feet = (13/24)x - 13/24 feet = (13/24)x - 0.54 feet Therefore, the correct answer is (E) (13x-12)/24.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "The bells will ring together again after the least common multiple (LCM) of their intervals. We can find the LCM of 36, 40, and 48 using prime factorization. 36 = 2^2 * 3^2 40 = 2^3 * 5 48 = 2^4 * 3 The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all the prime factors involved: LCM = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 = 720 seconds = 12 minutes Therefore, the bells will ring together again after 12 minutes. Hence, the answer is (B) After 12 minutes.",

            "Question": "Q: X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ? Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the amount of zinc and copper in 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y. For alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. This means that out of every 5 parts of the alloy, 2 parts are zinc and 3 parts are copper. Therefore, in 40 grams of alloy X, the amount of zinc is (2/5) * 40 = 16 grams and the amount of copper is (3/5) * 40 = 24 grams. For alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which simplifies to 1:1.57 (approximately). This means that out of every 2.57 parts of the alloy, 1 part is zinc and 1.57 parts are copper. Therefore, in 60 grams of alloy Y, the amount of zinc is (1/2.57) * 60 = 23.34 grams (approximately) and the amount of copper is (1.57/2.57) * 60 = 36.66 grams (approximately). Now, we can add the amounts of zinc and copper in the two alloys to get the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z. The total amount of zinc in alloy Z is 16 + 23.34 = 39.34 grams (approximately). The total amount of copper in alloy Z is 24 + 36.66 = 60.66 grams (approximately). Therefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is approximately 39.34:60.66, which simplifies to 59:91. Hence, the correct answer is (B) 59:91.",

If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the wholesale cost of the appliance be x. Then, the original retail price of the appliance is 1.6x (since it is 60% more than the wholesale cost). The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, which means it was sold for 0.8(1.6x) = 1.28x. \n\nThe percent increase from the wholesale cost to the selling price can be calculated as follows: \n\nPercent increase = ((selling price - wholesale cost) / wholesale cost) * 100 \n\nSubstituting the values we have, we get: \n\nPercent increase = ((1.28x - x) / x) * 100 = (0.28x / x) * 100 = 28% \n\nTherefore, the appliance was sold for 28% more than its wholesale cost. \n\nHence, the correct answer is (B) 28%.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume the breadth of the rectangular piece to be x meters. Then, the length of the rectangular piece is (4x + 1) meters. We know that the area of the rectangular piece is 150 sq m. Therefore, we can write: x(4x + 1) = 150 Simplifying this equation, we get: 4x^2 + x - 150 = 0 We can solve this quadratic equation to get: x = 5 or x = -7.5 (We can ignore the negative value of x) Therefore, the breadth of the rectangular piece is 5 meters and the length is (4 x 5 + 1) = 21 meters. The perimeter of the rectangular piece is: 2(length + breadth) = 2(21 + 5) = 52 meters. Therefore, the answer is (None of the above). The answer is None of the above.",

Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the total number of steps in the staircase is 'n'. Let the speed of the elevator be 's' steps/minute. According to the problem, if you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach the bottom in 10 minutes. This means that the time taken by the elevator to travel the remaining (n - 20) steps is (10 - 0.33) minutes, since you have already taken 0.33 minutes to walk down 20 steps. Therefore, we can write: (n - 20)/s = 9.67 If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach the ground in 20 minutes. This means that the time taken by the elevator to travel the remaining (n - 10) steps is (20 - 0.5) minutes, since you have already taken 0.5 minutes to walk down 10 steps. Therefore, we can write: (n - 10)/s = 19.5 Solving these two equations, we get: n = 230 and s = 3 steps/minute. Therefore, the answer is (C) 3 step/minute.",

If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The volume of the coin can be calculated as the volume of a cylinder: V = \u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius (half the diameter) and h is the height (thickness). We are given that the coin has a diameter of 15 mm and a thickness of 2 mm, so its radius is 7.5 mm. Therefore, V = \u03c0(7.5)^2(2) = 352.5\u03c0 mm^3.\n\nLet x be the fraction of the coin that is made of aluminum. Since the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver, we have:\n\nxV = (1-x)V\nx = 1-x\nx = 0.5\n\nTherefore, half of the coin is made of aluminum and half is made of silver. Let the weight of the aluminum part be w grams. Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of the silver part is 2w grams. The total weight of the coin is 30 grams, so we have:\n\nw + 2w = 30\n3w = 30\nw = 10\n\nTherefore, the weight of the aluminum part is 10 grams and the weight of the silver part is 20 grams. The total volume of the coin is the same as before, so we can use the same formula to calculate the volume of the aluminum coin:\n\nV = \u03c0r^2h = \u03c0(15/2)^2(1) = 176.25\u03c0 mm^3\n\nSince the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals the volume of silver, the volume of the aluminum coin is half of the total volume:\n\n0.5V = 88.125\u03c0 mm^3\n\nThe density of aluminum is 2.7 g/cm^3, so the mass of the aluminum coin is:\n\nm = \u03c1V = 2.7 g/cm^3 * (88.125\u03c0 mm^3 / 1000) * (1 cm / 10 mm)^3 = 2.7 * 88.125\u03c0 / 1000 = 0.74\u03c0 grams\n\nFinally, we can substitute \u03c0 with its approximate value of 3.14 to get:\n\nm \u2248 0.74 * 3.14 \u2248 2.32 grams\n\nTherefore, the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum is approximately 2.32 grams.
