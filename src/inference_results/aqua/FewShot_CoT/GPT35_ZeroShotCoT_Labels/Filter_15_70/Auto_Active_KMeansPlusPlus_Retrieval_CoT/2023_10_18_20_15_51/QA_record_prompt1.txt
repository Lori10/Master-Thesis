Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the jar is full of x candies. \n\nStep 1: Find the rate of eating of P. Since P can finish the jar in 10 minutes, his rate of eating is x/10 candies per minute. \n\nStep 2: Find the amount of candies eaten by Q in 5 minutes. Since Q can finish half the jar in 5 minutes, she eats x/2 candies in 5 minutes. Therefore, her rate of eating is (x/2)/5 = x/10 candies per minute. \n\nStep 3: Find the combined rate of eating of P and Q. Since they are eating simultaneously, their combined rate of eating is (x/10) + (x/10) = x/5 candies per minute. \n\nStep 4: Find the time taken by P and Q to finish the jar. Let's assume that they take t minutes to finish the jar. Therefore, the total amount of candies eaten by P and Q is (x/5) * t. But we know that the total amount of candies in the jar is x. Therefore, we can write the equation: (x/5) * t = x Solving for t, we get: t = 5 \n\nTherefore, it will take P and Q 5 minutes to empty the jar. \n\nAnswer: (B) 5. The answer is B.",

If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A is 100% each. Then, one gram of the health food contains 9% of vitamin E and 8% of vitamin A. To get 100% of vitamin E, we need to eat 100/9 grams of the health food. Similarly, to get 100% of vitamin A, we need to eat 100/8 grams of the health food. Since we need to get both vitamins from the same food, we need to take the least common multiple of 100/9 and 100/8, which is 25/9. Therefore, we need to eat (100/9) x (25/9) grams of the health food to get 100% of vitamin E and (100/8) x (25/9) grams of the health food to get 100% of vitamin A. Simplifying this, we get: (100/9) x (25/9) + (100/8) x (25/9) = (2500/72) grams \u2248 34.72 grams.

Let's call the number of months last year \"x\". Then, the total number of microwave ovens sold last year is 42x. We also know that in the first 10 months of this year, the store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month. Let's call the number of months this year \"y\". Then, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months of this year is 20y. We want to find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period, so we need to find the total number of microwave ovens sold during that period and divide by 22. The total number of microwave ovens sold is 42x + 20y. So, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period is: (42x + 20y)/22 We can simplify this expression by factoring out 2: (21x + 10y)/11 We don't know the values of x and y, but we do know that x + y = 22 (since there are 22 months in total). We can use this information to substitute for x in the expression above: (21(22-y) + 10y)/11 Simplifying this expression, we get: (462 - 11y + 10y)/11 = 462/11 - y/11 = 42 - y/11 Therefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period is 42 - y/11.

Let's assume that the cost of each brown sharpener is Rs. a. Then, the cost of each white sharpener is Rs. a + 1. We know that Jack paid Rs. 100 in total for all the sharpeners, so: xa + (a + 1)y = 100 Simplifying this equation, we get: xa + ay + y = 100 We can substitute x + y = 18 into this equation to get: a(x + y) + y = 100 a(18) + y = 100 18a + y = 100 We know that a must be less than 6, because if a is 6 or more, then the cost of each white sharpener would be Rs. 7 or more, which would make it impossible for Jack to buy 18 sharpeners for Rs. 100.

The time taken by ball B to complete one full rotation is 7 minutes (since it makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes). Let's assume that they meet after x minutes. In that time, ball A would have completed x/13 rotations and ball B would have completed x/7 rotations. For them to meet at the starting point, the difference in their rotations must be an integer. So, we can set up the equation: x/13 - x/7 = n, where n is an integer. Simplifying this equation, we get: 4x/91 = n Solving for x, we get: x = 91n/4 Now, we need to find the smallest value of n for which x is greater than or equal to 2 full rotations (since they need to meet at the starting point again). 2 full rotations is equal to 4 pi radians. So, we can set up the inequality: x/13 - x/7 >= 4 pi Solving for n, we get: n >= 52.5 The smallest integer greater than or equal to 52.5 is 53.

Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the combined rate of work for all three painters. Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so his rate of work is 1/6. Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so his rate of work is 1/8. Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so his rate of work is 1/12. Therefore, the combined rate of work for all three painters is: 1/6 + 1/8 + 1/12 = 6/24 + 3/24 + 2/24 = 11/24 This means that they can paint 11/24 of a house in one day. After 8 days, Mr. Brown leaves, so only Mr. Black and Mr. Blue are working. They have completed 8*(11/24) = 11/3 of a house. Now, Mr. Black works alone for 6 more days. In these 6 days, he can paint 6*(1/8) = 3/4 of a house. Therefore, the total amount of work done is 11/3 + 3/4 = 47/12 of a house. To complete the contract, they need to paint 3 houses, which is 3*(1) = 3 houses. Therefore, the amount of work left to do is 3 - 47/12 = 17/12 of a house. Finally, we can use Mr. Blue's rate of work to find how long it will take him to paint 17/12 of a house: (17/12) / (1/12) = 17 Therefore, it will take Mr. Blue 17 more days to complete the contract.

Since the train is traveling at a constant speed, we know that it covers a distance of 176 feet per second x 3 seconds = 528 feet in three seconds. Therefore, the length of the train is 528 feet. \n\nTo find the time it takes for the train to completely pass through the tunnel, we need to add the time it takes for the front of the train to enter the tunnel to the time it takes for the back of the train to exit the tunnel. \n\nThe time it takes for the front of the train to enter the tunnel is simply the time it takes for the train to cover the length of the tunnel at its speed of 176 feet per second. \n\nDistance = length of tunnel = 5280 feet \n\nTime = distance / speed = 5280 feet / 176 feet per second = 30 seconds \n\nTherefore, the time it takes for the front of the train to enter the tunnel is 30 seconds. \n\nThe time it takes for the back of the train to exit the tunnel is the same as the time it takes for the front of the train to enter the tunnel, since the train is traveling at a constant speed. \n\nTherefore, the total time it takes for the train to completely pass through the tunnel is: \n\n30 seconds (time for front of train to enter tunnel) + 30 seconds (time for back of train to exit tunnel) = 60 seconds \n\nTherefore, the answer is None of the above.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step. Let the rate of interest be R% per annum. Then, the Simple Interest (SI) for 2 years on Rs. 5000 will be: SI = (P * R * T) / 100 = (5000 * R * 2) / 100 = 100R Now, let's calculate the Compound Interest (CI) for 2 years on Rs. 5000 at the same rate of interest. CI = P[(1 + R/100)^T - 1] = 5000[(1 + R/100)^2 - 1] = 5000[(100 + R)^2 - 10000] / 10000 = 5000[(10000 + 2*100*R + R^2 - 10000)] / 10000 = 100R + (R^2 * 5000) / 10000 = 100R + (R^2 * 50) / 100 Now, the difference between CI and SI is given as Rs. 72. Therefore, 100R + (R^2 * 50) / 100 - 100R = 72 Simplifying the above equation, we get: (R^2 * 50) / 100 = 72 Solving for R, we get: R^2 = 144 R = 12% Therefore, the rate of interest is 12% per annum.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We know that x < 0 and y > 0. Let's simplify the given inequality: |x^3| > |y^2| This means that either x^3 > y^2 or x^3 < -y^2. We can simplify the second inequality by multiplying both sides by -1 and changing the direction of the inequality: x^3 > y^2 or x^3 > y^2 Since y > 0, we can take the square root of both sides of y^2 < x^3 to get y < x^(3/2). Now we can check which of the answer choices must be true: (A) x > y: This is not necessarily true, because x can be much smaller than y. For example, x = -10 and y = 100 satisfy the given conditions, but x < y. (B) y^2 > x^2: This is not necessarily true either, because we don't know anything about the relative sizes of x and y. For example, x = -10 and y = 1 satisfy the given conditions, but y^2 < x^2. (C) -x^3 < y^2: This is not necessarily true, because we don't know anything about the relative sizes of x and y.

For example, x = -10 and y = 1 satisfy the given conditions, but -x > y. (E) x < -y: This must be true, because we know that x < 0 and y > 0, so -y < 0. Also, from y < x^(3/2), we can raise both sides to the power of 2/3 to get y^(2/3) < x. Since y > 0, we can cube both sides to get y^2 < x^3.

            "Question": "Q: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth? Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the original side of the square piece of cloth be x feet. After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the rectangular piece has dimensions (x-4) by x. \n\nThe area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height. \n\nSo, (1/2) * (x-4) * (x/2) = 70 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n(x-4) * (x/2) = 140 \n\nx^2 - 4x - 560 = 0 \n\nSolving for x using the quadratic formula, we get: \n\nx = 28 or x = -20 \n\nSince the side of the square piece of cloth cannot be negative, we take x = 28 feet. \n\nTherefore, the original piece of cloth had a perimeter of 4x = 4(28) = 112 feet. \n\nBut we trimmed 4 feet from one edge, so the perimeter of the final rectangular piece is 2(x-4) + 2x = 4x - 8 = 104 feet. \n\nWhen we cut this rectangular piece diagonally in half, we get two right triangles with legs (x-4) and x. \n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the hypotenuse of each triangle: \n\nh^2 = (x-4)^2 + x^2 \n\nh^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16 \n\nSince the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle to get: \n\n(1/2) * (x-4) * x = 70 \n\nx^2 - 4x - 140 = 0 \n\nSolving for x using the quadratic formula, we get: \n\nx = 14 or x = -10 \n\nAgain, we take x = 14 feet. \n\nTherefore, the length of the hypotenuse of each triangle is: \n\nh^2 = 2(14)^2 - 8(14) + 16 \n\nh^2 = 360 \n\nh = 6\u221a10 \n\nThe perimeter of each triangle is (x-4) + x + 6\u221a10 = 2x - 4 + 6\u221a10 = 52 + 6\u221a10 feet. \n\nSo, the total perimeter of both triangles is 2(52 + 6\u221a10) = 104 + 12\u221a10 feet. \n\nAdding the perimeter of the final rectangular piece, we get: \n\n104 + 12\u221a10 + 104 = 208 + 12\u221a10 feet. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) 64.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step. Let's assume that the cost price of each bag of flour is x. The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price, which means that the selling price is 1.25x. We know that the selling price of each bag is $100, so we can write: 1.25x = $100 Solving for x, we get: x = $80 Now, we can calculate the profit made on each bag: Profit per bag = Selling price - Cost price = $100 - $80 = $20 We also know that the total profit made is $3,000. Let's assume that the grocer sold n bags of flour.

Let's use x = y in the equation above: x/7 + x/9 = 35 Multiplying both sides by 63 (the least common multiple of 7 and 9) gives: 9x + 7x = 2205 Simplifying and solving for x gives: x = 175 Therefore, Alex worked for 175 hours and made 25 toys, and Jacob worked for 175 hours and made 10 toys.

The formula for the circumference of a circle is C = 2\u03c0r, where C is the circumference, \u03c0 is pi (approximately 3.14), and r is the radius. Therefore, the circumference of the circle is C = 2\u03c0(10) = 20\u03c0 centimeters. \n\nNext, we need to find the distance traveled by the point after 30 seconds. We know that the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minute, which means that it completes 300/60 = 5 revolutions per second. Therefore, the point on the edge of the fan blade completes 5 revolutions per second as well. \n\nThe distance traveled by the point after 30 seconds is equal to the product of the distance traveled in one revolution and the number of revolutions completed in 30 seconds.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's break down the problem. \n\nLet's assume that there are 100 chocolates in the store. \n\nStep 1: Find the number of cocoa flavored chocolates. \n\n10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, so the number of cocoa flavored chocolates is 10% of 100, which is 10. \n\nStep 2: Find the number of non-cocoa flavored chocolates. \n\nThe total number of chocolates is 100, and 10 of them are cocoa flavored. So, the number of non-cocoa flavored chocolates is 100 - 10, which is 90. \n\nStep 3: Find the number of squashed chocolates. \n\n90% of the non-cocoa flavored chocolates are squashed, so the number of squashed chocolates is 90% of 90, which is 81. \n\nStep 4: Find the number of non-squashed chocolates. \n\nThe total number of chocolates is 100, and 81 of them are squashed. So, the number of non-squashed chocolates is 100 - 81, which is 19. \n\nStep 5: Find the number of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed. \n\nWe want to find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed, but we don't know the exact number of chocolates that meet this criteria. However, we do know that all the cocoa flavored chocolates are not vanilla flavored, and all the squashed chocolates are not both vanilla flavored and not squashed. Therefore, the number of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed must be the difference between the total number of non-cocoa flavored chocolates and the number of squashed chocolates. \n\nThe total number of non-cocoa flavored chocolates is 90, and the number of squashed chocolates is 81. So, the number of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 90 - 81, which is 9. \n\nStep 6: Find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed. \n\nOut of 100 chocolates, 9 are both vanilla flavored and not squashed. Therefore, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is (9/100) x 100, which is 9%. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 9%.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the total number of people who took the survey is \"x\". We know that 60% of the people who took the survey were women. Therefore, the number of women who took the survey is 0.6x. This means that the number of men who took the survey is 0.4x. We also know that 75% of the men who were surveyed preferred red cars over green cars. This means that 25% of the men who were surveyed preferred green cars over red cars. We are given that 10 men liked green cars more than red. Therefore, the number of men who preferred red cars is: 0.75(0.4x) = 0.3x. This means that the number of men who preferred green cars is: 0.25(0.4x) = 0.1x. We can set up an equation to solve for \"x\": 0.6x + 0.4x = 0.3x + 0.1x + 10 Simplifying the equation, we get: 1x = 200 Therefore, the total number of people who took the survey is 200.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet be l and b respectively. When folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm. This means that the length of each part is (48/2) - b = 24 - b. Similarly, when folded along the other set of sides, the length of each part is (66/2) - l = 33 - l. Now, we know that the length of each part is the same, so we can equate them: 24 - b = 33 - l l - b = 9 We also know that the perimeter of the rectangular sheet is 2(l + b). Substituting l - b = 9, we get: 2(l + b) = 2(l + (l - 9)) = 4l - 18 4l = 2(l + b) + 18 2l = l + b + 9 l = (b + 9)/2 Now, we can substitute this value of l in the equation l - b = 9 to get: (b + 9)/2 - b = 9 b = 12 Substituting b = 12 in the equation l = (b + 9)/2, we get l = 10.

            "Pred_Rationale": "When Ram and Krishna meet at point C, they have covered a total distance equal to the sum of the distances they have traveled from their respective starting points. Let's call the distance from A to C \"x\" and the distance from B to C \"y\". We know that Ram's speed is 20 m/s and Krishna's speed is 40 m/s. They meet after 10 seconds, so we can set up the equation: 20 x + 40 y = (20 + 40) * 10 Simplifying this equation, we get: 20 x + 40 y = 600 Now, we need to use the fact that the total distance between A and B is equal to the sum of the distances from A to C and from B to C. Therefore, the total distance is: x + y To solve for x and y, we need another equation. We know that Ram and Krishna started at the same time, so the time they have traveled is the same.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can start by finding the time difference between the two trains. Train M takes 4 hours to travel from City A to City B, while Train N takes 3.5 hours to travel from City B to City A. This means that Train N departs 1.5 hours after Train M. We can use this time difference to find the distance between the two trains when they start moving towards each other. \n\nLet's say that Train M travels x km before the two trains meet. Then, Train N would have traveled (x - 210) km (since it departs 1.5 hours later and travels for 3.5 hours). The total distance between the two trains is the sum of these distances, which is equal to 2x - 210 km. \n\nWe know that the two trains are moving towards each other, so their relative speed is the sum of their speeds. Let's say that the speed of Train M is v1 km/h and the speed of Train N is v2 km/h. Then, their relative speed is v1 + v2 km/h. \n\nWe can use the formula: distance = speed x time to find the time it takes for the two trains to meet. Plugging in the values we know, we get: \n\n2x - 210 = (v1 + v2) t \n\nWe also know that Train M has been traveling for 2 hours (from 5 am to 7 am) when Train N starts moving towards it. So, the total time it takes for the two trains to meet is 2 + t hours. \n\nNow, we need to find the values of x, v1, and v2. We know that Train M travels x km in 4 hours, so its speed is v1 = x/4 km/h. Similarly, Train N travels (x - 210) km in 3.5 hours, so its speed is v2 = (x - 210)/3.5 km/h. \n\nSubstituting these values in the equation above, we get: \n\n2x - 210 = (x/4 + (x - 210)/3.5) t \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nx = 630 km \n\nSubstituting this value in the equation for v1, we get: \n\nv1 = 630/4 = 157.5 km/h \n\nSubstituting this value in the equation for v2, we get: \n\nv2 = (630 - 210)/3.5 = 120 km/h \n\nNow, we can use the equation: \n\n2x - 210 = (v1 + v2) t \n\nSubstituting the values we know, we get: \n\n2(630) - 210 = (157.5 + 120) t \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nt = 1.2 hours = 1 hour and 12 minutes \n\nTherefore, the two trains will cross each other 1 hour and 12 minutes after Train N starts moving towards City A, which is at 8:12 am. \n\nHowever, we need to add the 2 hours that Train M has already been traveling to get the actual time when the two trains cross each other. \n\nSo, the two trains will cross each other at 10:12 am. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is None of the above.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find out the total ratio of the mixture. The ratio of rice to wheat to corn is 2:3:5, which means that the total ratio is 2+3+5 = 10. Next, we can find out the fraction of the mixture that is corn by dividing the ratio of corn by the total ratio: 5/10 = 1/2. This means that half of the mixture is corn. Since we know that the bag contains 3 pounds of rice, we can use this information to find out the total weight of the mixture. Let x be the total weight of the mixture. Then, we can set up a proportion: 2/10 = 3/x Solving for x, we get: x = 15 pounds Now we know that half of the mixture is corn, so we can find out how much corn the bag contains by multiplying the total weight of the mixture by 1/2: 15 x 1/2 = 7.5 Therefore, the answer is (B) 7.5.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can get a 4% discount if he pays within 30 days, or he can pay the full amount within n days and get no discount. Let's assume that the merchant borrows money to pay for the motor boat and wants to take advantage of the discount. If he pays within 30 days, he will only have to pay 96% of the invoice amount, which is $20,000 * 0.96 = $19,200. Let's assume that he borrows this amount at a simple interest rate of r% per year for 30 days. Then, the interest he will have to pay is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time / 365 = 19,200 * r * 30 / 36500 = 0.1575r If the interest rate is too high, the interest he will have to pay will be more than the discount he will get. So, we need to find the highest interest rate at which he can still afford to borrow money. That is: 0.1575r <= 800 (the discount he will get) r <= 5079.365 ~ 5079.37% This is obviously not a realistic interest rate, so the answer is None of these.",

Let's assume that the length of the painted sides is l and the width of the parking space is w. We are given that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet. Therefore, the length of the parking space is l + 9 feet. We are also given that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation: 2l + w = 37 feet. We can rearrange this equation to get w in terms of l: w = 37 - 2l feet. Now, we can substitute this value of w in terms of l in the expression for the area of the parking space: Area = (l + 9)w = (l + 9)(37 - 2l) square feet. We want to maximize the area of the parking space. To do this, we can take the derivative of the expression for the area with respect to l and set it equal to zero: d(Area)/dl = -4l + 199 = 0 Solving for l, we get l = 49.75 feet. Therefore, the width of the parking space is w = 37 - 2l = -62.5 feet, which is not possible. This means that the maximum area of the parking space is obtained when l is at one of its endpoints, which are 0 and 18.5 feet. When l = 0, the area is 9w = 9(37) = 333 square feet. When l = 18.5, the width of the parking space is w = 37 - 2l = 37 - 37 = 0 feet, which is not possible. Therefore, the area of the parking space is 333 square feet.

Then, we know that 20% of them are not members of the chess club, which means 0.2x students are only in the swim team. We also know that 24 students are in both clubs, which means the remaining students in the swim team are in both the swim team and the chess club.

From the given information, we can write two equations: Equation 1: x + 2y = 150 (one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents) Equation 2: 2x + 3y = 300 (two sodas and three energy bars for 300 cents) We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y. Multiplying Equation 1 by 2 and subtracting it from Equation 2, we get: 2x + 3y - 2x - 4y = 300 - 300  y = 50 Substituting y = 50 in Equation 1, we get: x + 2(50) = 150 x = 50 Therefore, the cost of one soda is 50 cents and the cost of one energy bar is 50 cents.

So, Karan's cost price is Rs. 1200. He wants to make a profit of 20%, which means he wants to sell the sewing machine at 120% of its cost price. Selling price = Cost price x (100% + Profit%) Selling price = 1200 x (100% + 20%) Selling price = 1200 x 1.2 Selling price = Rs. 1440 Now, Karan wants to offer a 20% discount on this selling price.

Similarly, the time it takes him to travel from B to A at a rate of 90 mph is: time = distance / rate = d / 90. We know that Kevin was 70 miles away from B exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip. This means that he had already traveled for d / 70 - 3 hours when he was 70 miles away from B.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to understand the given information. M is a three-digit number, so we can write it as 100a + 10b + c. N is the number obtained by reversing the digits of M, so we can write it as 100c + 10b + a. We are given that M > N, so 100a + 10b + c > 100c + 10b + a, which simplifies to 99a > 99c or a > c. \n\nNext, we are given that M - N + 396c = 990. Substituting the expressions for M and N, we get:\n\n(100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n99a - 99c + 397c = 990\n\n99(a - c) = 990 - 397c\n\nDividing both sides by 99, we get:\n\na - c = (990 - 397c)/99\n\nSince a > c, we know that (990 - 397c)/99 > 0, which means that 990 - 397c > 0 or c < 990/397. Since c is a digit, the largest possible value of c is 9, so we have:\n\nc < 990/397 < 3\n\nTherefore, c can only be 1 or 2. \n\nNow, we need to count the number of values of M that are more than 300 and satisfy the given conditions. Since a > c, we know that a can be any digit from 3 to 9, and c can be either 1 or 2. For each value of a and c, we can choose any digit for b except for the digit that was chosen for a or c. Therefore, the total number of values of M that are more than 300 and satisfy the given conditions is:\n\n(7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1) x 8 = 168\n\n(Note that we are multiplying by 8 because there are 8 choices for b for each value of a and c.)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 200.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the length of the rectangular yard be L and the width be W. We know that the area of the yard is 240 square meters. Therefore, we have:\n\nL x W = 240\n\nWe also know that Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. This means that the perimeter of the yard that needs fencing is:\n\nP = 2L + W - 10\n\nWe subtract 10 from the perimeter because one side of 10 meters is not fenced. We can simplify this expression by using the formula for the area of the yard:\n\nP = 2L + W - 10\nP = 2(L + W) - 10\nP = 2(240/W + W) - 10\n\nNow we can substitute the value of P into the formula for the perimeter of the yard:\n\nP = 2(240/W + W) - 10\nP = 480/W + 2W - 10\n\nWe want to minimize the amount of fencing needed, so we need to find the value of W that minimizes the perimeter. To do this, we take the derivative of the perimeter with respect to W and set it equal to zero:\n\ndP/dW = -480/W^2 + 2 = 0\n480/W^2 = 2\nW^2 = 240\nW = sqrt(240) = 15.49\n\nWe can round this up to 16 meters.

We know that the plane started when the ship had already traveled 180 miles, so the distance the plane travels is d - 180. We also know that the speed of the plane is 10 times the speed of the ship, so the speed of the plane is 10s. We can set up the equation: d/s = (d-180)/10s Simplifying this equation, we get: 10d = s(d-180) 10d = sd - 180s 180s = sd - 10d s(180 + 10) = d s = d/19 Plugging this value of s into the original equation, we get: d/(d/19) = (d-180)/(10d/19) Simplifying this equation, we get: 19d = (d-180)/10 190d = d - 1800 189d = 1800 d = 1800/189 * 19 = 1800/10 = 180 Therefore, the distance they meet from the starting point is 180 + 180 = 360 miles.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the original mixture contains x kg of sand and y kg of clay. We know that the total weight of the mixture is 10 kg. So, we can write: x + y = 10 We also know that the mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. So, we can write: x/(x + y) = 0.3 and y/(x + y) = 0.7 Now, we want to remove some of the mixture and replace it with pure sand so that the mixture contains equal quantities of sand and clay. Let's say we remove z kg of the mixture and replace it with z kg of pure sand. After this, the weight of the mixture will still be 10 kg. So, we can write: (x - 0.3z + z) + (y - 0.7z) = 10 Simplifying this equation, we get: x + y - 0.4z = 10 We also want the mixture to contain equal quantities of sand and clay. So, we can write: (x - 0.3z + z)/(10 - z) = 0.5 and (y - 0.7z)/(10 - z) = 0.5 Simplifying these equations, we get: x - 0.2z = 5 and y - 0.2z = 5 Now, we have three equations: x + y = 10 x - 0.2z = 5 y - 0.2z = 5 We can solve these equations to find the value of z. Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get: 0.2z = 5 Solving for z, we get: z = 25/2 = 12.5 Therefore, we need to remove 12.5/10 = 5/4 of the original mixture and replace it with 5/4 kg of pure sand. Simplifying, we get: 5/4 = 1.25 5/4 of 10 kg = 12.5 kg So, we need to remove 12.5 kg of the mixture and replace it with 1.25 kg of pure sand. The amount of mixture to be removed is 12.5 kg, which is equal to (12.5/10) = 5/4 of the original mixture. So, the answer is (A) 5/4 or 10/7. The answer is A.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can start by using the formula: time = distance / speed We know the distance is the same for both the car and the bicycle since it's the same route. Let's call the distance \"d\". For the car: time = d / 20 km/h (since the worker drives at an average rate of 20 km/h) We need to convert the time to minutes, so let's multiply by 60: time = d / 20 km/h x 60 min/h time = 3d min For the bicycle: time = d / 6 km/h (since the worker cycles at an average rate of 6 km/h) We need to solve for time in minutes, so let's multiply by 60: time = d / 6 km/h x 60 min/h time = 10d min Now we can set up an equation using the two expressions we found for time: 3d = 9 (since it takes 9 minutes to drive to work) 10d = ? (we want to find out how many minutes it takes to cycle to work) Solving for d in the first equation: d = 3 km Substituting d = 3 km into the second equation: 10d = 10 x 3 km = 30 km So it takes the worker 30 minutes to cycle to work.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the area of the square paper. The formula for the area of a square is A = s^2, where s is the length of a side. The side of the square paper is 20 cm, so the area of the paper is: A = 20^2 A = 400 square cm\n\nNext, we need to find the area of the two semi-circles. The formula for the area of a circle is A = \u03c0r^2, where r is the radius. Since the diameter of each semi-circle is 20 cm, the radius is half of that, which is 10 cm. Therefore, the area of one semi-circle is: A = (1/2)\u03c0(10)^2 A = 50\u03c0/2 A = 25\u03c0 square cm\n\nThe area of two semi-circles is twice this amount, so it is: 2(25\u03c0) = 50\u03c0 square cm\n\nWhen we cut out the two semi-circles, we are left with a square paper with two quarter-circles missing. The area of each quarter-circle is half the area of a semi-circle, so it is: (1/2)(25\u03c0/2) = 25\u03c0/4 square cm\n\nThere are two quarter-circles missing, so the total area of the missing parts is: 2(25\u03c0/4) = 25\u03c0/2 square cm\n\nTherefore, the area of the remaining paper is: 400 - 25\u03c0/2 \u2248 391.46 square cm\n\nOut of the given answer choices, the closest one to 391.46 is (B) 8.79.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the cost of repairing the current tires for one year is 'x'. So, the cost of repairing the current tires for four years would be 4x. The cost of purchasing new tires would be $180 per tire, which means $720 for four tires. Since the new tires last for four years, the average cost per year would be $720/4 = $180. Now, we need to find the percentage by which the average cost per year of the new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires. (Average cost per year of new tires - Cost of repairing current tires per year)/Cost of repairing current tires per year x 100% = ($180 - x)/x x 100% We know that x = $40, so substituting this value, we get: ($180 - $40)/$40 x 100% = 4.5 x 100% = 450% = 12.5% (approx.)

The sum of these numbers is:\n\nx + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8) = 5x + 20\n\nNow, we need to find a perfect square that is obtained when this sum is divided by 10. Let's try each option and see if it works:\n\n(A) 47: The sum of the five consecutive odd numbers starting with 47 is 47 + 49 + 51 + 53 + 55 = 255.

Since the thickness of the cube is 1 cm, the inner cube of side length 3 cm (5 cm - 2 cm) is made up of smaller cubes of side length 1 cm. Therefore, the number of smaller cubes in the inner cube is 3^3 = 27. The number of smaller cubes on the outer layer of the inner cube is 20 (since the inner cube has 6 faces, and the outer layer consists of the 4 edges of each face, which is 4 x 6 = 24 cubes, minus the 4 corners, which are counted twice). Therefore, the total number of smaller cubes that have at least one face painted is 6 x 5^2 - 20 = 130. Since the total number of smaller cubes is 5^3 = 125, the number of smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 125 - 130 = -5. This is not a valid answer, so we must have made a mistake somewhere. The mistake is in our calculation of the number of smaller cubes on the outer layer of the inner cube.

A can construct a wall in 40 minutes, so their rate of work is 1/40. B can construct the wall in 45 minutes, so their rate of work is 1/45. When they work together, their combined rate of work is the sum of their individual rates of work: 1/40 + 1/45 = 9/360 + 8/360 = 17/360. Therefore, they can construct 17/360 of the wall in one minute when they work together. To find how long it will take them to construct the whole wall, we can use the formula: time = work / rate. The work they need to do is 1 (the whole wall), and their combined rate of work is 17/360. time = 1 / (17/360) = 360/17 minutes. Converting this to hours, we get: time = (360/17) / 60 = 21.17 hours (approx). Therefore, the answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match our calculation. The correct answer is approximately 21.17 hours. The answer is None of the above.",

There are 2 ways to choose 4 non-adjacent points: either choose 4 points that are not next to each other in the pentagon, or choose 2 points that are next to each other and 2 points that are not next to each other. For example, we could choose points A, C, E, and F, or we could choose points A, B, D, and F. If we choose 4 adjacent points, we will form a pentagon, not a quadrilateral. There are 5 ways to choose 4 adjacent points: ABCE, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, and EABC.

We know that: V + W + B = 250 (all files are accounted for) W = 2.5B (the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number infected by both) V = 0.5(250 - V) (50% of the files were not infected by a virus) We can simplify the third equation to: V = 125 - 0.5V Now we can substitute this into the first equation to eliminate V: (125 - 0.5V) + W + B = 250 0.5V + W + B = 125 We can also substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate B: V + W + 2.5B = 250 V + W + 2.5(W/2.5) = 250 V + 2W = 250 - W/2 We can simplify this to: V + 3W/2 = 125 Now we have two equations with two variables: 0.5V + W + B = 125 V + 3W/2 = 125 We can solve for W in the first equation: W = 125 - 0.5V - B We can substitute this into the second equation to eliminate W: V + 3(125 - 0.5V - B)/2 = 125 V + 187.5 - 0.75V - 1.5B = 125 -0.25V - 1.5B = -62.5 0.25V + 1.5B = 62.5 Now we have two equations with two variables: 0.25V + 1.5B = 62.5 W = 125 - 0.5V - B We want to find the number of files that were not infected by a worm, which is equal to the number of files that were infected by a virus or not infected by either a virus or a worm. We know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so the number of files infected by a virus is 0.5(250) = 125. We also know that V + B is the number of files infected by a virus or both a virus and a worm. So the number of files that were infected by a virus or not infected by either a virus or a worm is: 125 + (250 - (V + B)) = 375 - V - B We can substitute the second equation into this to eliminate B: 125 + (250 - V - 2.5B) = 375 - V - B 2B = 125 B = 62.5 We can substitute this into the second equation to find V: 0.25V + 1.5(62.5) = 62.5 V = 125 We can substitute these values into the expression we found earlier to find the number of files that were not infected by a worm: 375 - V - B = 375 - 125 - 62.5 = 187.5 Therefore, the answer is (E) 125.

Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the staircase elevator has \"x\" steps. Let's also assume that the speed of the elevator is \"s\" steps/minute. \n\nFrom the first piece of information, we know that if you walk 20 steps and stop, it takes 10 minutes to reach the bottom. This means that the time it takes to descend \"x-20\" steps is 10 minutes minus the time it takes to walk 20 steps, which is 20/s minutes. So we can write:\n\nx - 20 = s * (10 - 20/s)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx - 20 = 10s - 200/s\n\nMultiplying both sides by s, we get:\n\nxs - 20s = 10s^2 - 200\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\nxs = 10s^2 + 20s - 200\n\nNow let's use the second piece of information. We know that if you walk 10 steps and stop, it takes 20 minutes to reach the bottom. This means that the time it takes to descend \"x-10\" steps is 20 minutes minus the time it takes to walk 10 steps, which is 10/s minutes. So we can write:\n\nx - 10 = s * (20 - 10/s)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx - 10 = 20s - 100/s\n\nMultiplying both sides by s, we get:\n\nxs - 10s = 20s^2 - 100\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\nxs = 20s^2 + 10s - 100\n\nNow we have two equations for \"xs\", so we can set them equal to each other:\n\n10s^2 + 20s - 200 = 20s^2 + 10s - 100\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n10s^2 - 10s - 100 = 0\n\nDividing both sides by 10, we get:\n\ns^2 - s - 10 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\ns = (1 \u00b1 sqrt(41))/2\n\nSince the speed of the elevator cannot be negative, we can discard the negative solution. Therefore, the speed of the elevator is:\n\ns = (1 + sqrt(41))/2\n\nThis is approximately 3.56 steps/minute, so the answer is (C) 3 step/minute. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 3 step/minute.",

Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the volume of the coin made of aluminum and silver. The volume of the coin can be calculated as the volume of a cylinder with height 2 mm and radius 7.5 mm (half of the diameter). Volume of the coin = \u03c0 x (7.5 mm)^2 x 2 mm = 352.5 mm^3 Let's assume the volume of aluminum in the coin is x mm^3. Since the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, the volume of silver in the coin is also x mm^3. Let's assume the density of aluminum is y g/cm^3. Then, the weight of aluminum in the coin is: weight of aluminum = volume of aluminum x density of aluminum = (x/1000) cm^3 x y g/cm^3 = xy/1000 g Similarly, the weight of silver in the coin is: weight of silver = volume of silver x density of silver = (x/1000) cm^3 x 2y g/cm^3 = 2xy/1000 g The total weight of the coin is given as 30 grams. So, we can set up the equation: weight of aluminum + weight of silver = 30 grams xy/1000 + 2xy/1000 = 30 grams 3xy/1000 = 30 grams xy = 10000 mm^3 Now, we need to find the weight of a pure aluminum coin measuring 1 x 30 mm. The volume of this coin can be calculated as the volume of a cylinder with height 1 mm and radius 15 mm. Volume of the pure aluminum coin = \u03c0 x (15 mm)^2 x 1 mm = 225\u03c0 mm^3 Let's assume the density of pure aluminum is z g/cm^3. Then, the weight of the pure aluminum coin is: weight of pure aluminum coin = volume of pure aluminum x density of pure aluminum = (225\u03c0/1000) cm^3 x z g/cm^3 = 0.225\u03c0z grams We know that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum. So, we can set up the equation: 2y = z Solving for z, we get: z = 2y Substituting this value in the equation for weight of pure aluminum coin, we get: weight of pure aluminum coin = 0.225\u03c0z = 0.225\u03c0(2y) = 0.45\u03c0y grams Substituting the value of xy from the earlier equation, we get: xy = 10000 mm^3 = (352.5 mm^3) x (x/352.5) x (10000/352.5) = x^2 x 84.507 So, x^2 = 10000/84.507 = 118.34 mm^3 Taking the square root, we get: x = 10.87 mm^3 Now, we can substitute the value of y in terms of x in the equation for weight of pure aluminum coin: weight of pure aluminum coin = 0.45\u03c0y = 0.45\u03c0(x/2) = 0.225\u03c0x = 0.225\u03c0(10.87) = 7.67 grams Therefore, the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum is 7.67 grams.
