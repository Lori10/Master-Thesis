To get 100% of vitamin E, we need to eat 100/9 grams of the health food. Similarly, to get 100% of vitamin A, we need to eat 100/8 grams of the health food. Since we need to get both vitamins from the same food, we need to eat the same amount of the health food for both vitamins. Therefore, we need to eat the LCM of 100/9 and 100/8 grams of the health food to get at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins. LCM of 100/9 and 100/8 = 1400/9 grams \u2248 155 grams.

Therefore, the cost price of 100% of the manufactured pens is: Cost price of 100% of the pens = Selling price of 100% of the pens / (1 + Profit%) Cost price of 100% of the pens = Rs. 7200 / (1 + 25%) = Rs. 5760/1.25 = Rs. 4608 Now, we need to find the cost of manufacturing one pen. Cost of manufacturing one pen = Cost price of 100% of the pens / Number of pens manufactured Cost of manufacturing one pen = Rs. 4608 / (100% - 10%) of the pens = Rs. 4608 / 90% of the pens = Rs. 5120/90 = Rs. 56.89 (approx) Therefore, the cost of manufacturing one pen is Rs. 56.89 (approx). None of the given options match the calculated cost of manufacturing one pen. The answer is (E) None of these.",

Since the common difference is 3 months, the ages of the members can be represented as a, a+3, a+6, ..., a+3(n-1). The sum of the ages of all the members is given as 250, so we can write: a + (a+3) + (a+6) + ... + [a+3(n-1)] = 250 Simplifying this equation, we get: n(2a + 3(n-1))/2 = 250 Multiplying both sides by 2 and simplifying, we get: n(2a + 3n - 3) = 500 We also know that the age of the youngest member is 7 years, so we can write: a = 7 Substituting this value into the previous equation, we get: n(14 + 3n - 3) = 500 Simplifying this equation, we get: 3n^2 + 11n - 250 = 0 Factoring this quadratic equation, we get: (3n - 25)(n + 10) = 0 The positive solution for n is n = 25.

Let's assume that the cost of each brown sharpener is Rs. a. Then, the cost of each white sharpener is Rs. a + 1.

Now, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time For the running part of the journey, the distance is 'd' miles, the speed is 10 miles/hr, and the time is 0.5 hours. So, the distance covered while running is: distance = 10 x 0.5 = 5 miles For the walking part of the journey, the distance is 'd' miles, the speed is 5 miles/hr, and the time is 0.5 hours.

In other words, \n\nGCF(a, b) x LCM(a, b) = a x b \n\nWe know that the GCF is 11 and one of the integers is 350, so we can plug in these values: \n\n11 x LCM(11, b) = 350b \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\nLCM(11, b) = 50b \n\nWe also know that the LCM of the two integers is 7700, so we can set up another equation: \n\nLCM(a, b) = 7700 \n\nSubstituting LCM(11, b) for the LCM, we get: \n\n11b x LCM(11, b) = 7700a \n\n11b x 50b = 7700a \n\n550b^2 = 7700a \n\nDividing both sides by 550, we get: \n\nb^2 = 14a \n\nSince a and b are both positive integers, we know that a must be a multiple of 14.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Given, x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days. Therefore, the rate of work of each man is 1/x units per hour. Now, let's find the total work done by x men working x hours per day in x days. Total work done = rate of work of each man * number of men * number of hours per day * number of days = (1/x) * x * x * x = x^3 units of work. Now, we need to find how much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days. Let the amount of work completed be W. Therefore, the rate of work of each man is W/(y*y*y) units per hour. Since x men can do x^3 units of work in x days, their rate of work is (x^3)/(x*x*x) = 1 unit per hour. Therefore, we can equate the rates of work of x men and y men to get: (x^3)/(x*x*x) = W/(y*y*y) Solving for W, we get: W = (x^3 * y*y*y) / (x*x*x) = xy^2 units of work.

Similarly, Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so he would take 9y hours to make y toys. We also know that both of them made 35 toys in total. So, we can set up an equation based on the total number of toys made: x + y = 35 We also know that both of them worked for almost similar number of hours. This means that the ratio of the time taken by Alex and Jacob to make their respective toys should be approximately equal to the ratio of the number of toys they made.

We know that the cost of each trouser is Rs.70 and the cost of each shirt is Rs.30. So, we can write two equations based on the given information: 70x + 30y = 810 (total cost) x <= maximum number of trousers purchased (maximum value of x) We need to find the ratio of trousers and shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. To do this, we need to find the value of x. Let's solve the first equation for y: 70x + 30y = 810 30y = 810 - 70x y = (810 - 70x)/30 Now, we know that x <= maximum number of trousers purchased. We also know that x has to be a whole number (you can't buy a fraction of a trouser). So, we need to find the maximum whole number value of x that satisfies this condition. Let's try different values of x: If x = 1, y = (810 - 70)/30 = 24 If x = 2, y = (810 - 140)/30 = 22 If x = 3, y = (810 - 210)/30 = 20 If x = 4, y = (810 - 280)/30 = 18 If x = 5, y = (810 - 350)/30 = 16 If x = 6, y = (810 - 420)/30 = 14 If x = 7, y = (810 - 490)/30 = 12 If x = 8, y = (810 - 560)/30 = 10 If x = 9, y = (810 - 630)/30 = 8 If x = 10, y = (810 - 700)/30 = 6 If x = 11, y = (810 - 770)/30 = 4 If x = 12, y = (810 - 840)/30 = 2 If x = 13, y = (810 - 910)/30 = -6 (not possible, as y has to be a non-negative integer) Therefore, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is 9, and the corresponding number of shirts is 8.

So, the number of non-cocoa flavored chocolates is 100 - 10, which is 90. \n\nStep 3: Find the number of squashed chocolates. \n\n90% of the non-cocoa flavored chocolates are squashed, so the number of squashed chocolates is 90% of 90, which is 81. \n\nStep 4: Find the number of non-squashed chocolates. \n\nThe total number of chocolates is 100, and 81 of them are squashed. So, the number of non-squashed chocolates is 100 - 81, which is 19. \n\nStep 5: Find the number of non-squashed, vanilla flavored chocolates. \n\nWe want to find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed. We know that 90% of the non-cocoa flavored chocolates are squashed, so the remaining 10% are not squashed. Therefore, the number of non-cocoa flavored, non-squashed chocolates is 10% of 90, which is 9. \n\nOut of these 9 chocolates, we want to find the percentage that are vanilla flavored. We know that all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. Therefore, the 9 non-cocoa flavored, non-squashed chocolates must be vanilla flavored. \n\nSo, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is (9/100) x 100, which is 9%. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 9%.",

According to the problem, 20% of the students took physics and 28% of the students took math. We don't know if there are any students who took both physics and math, so we can't assume anything about the overlap between the two groups. Therefore, the minimum number of students in the school would be if all the students who took physics are different from all the students who took math. In other words, the minimum number of students would be if the two groups are disjoint. Let's calculate the minimum number of students using this assumption. Number of students who took physics = 20% of x = 0.2x Number of students who took math = 28% of x = 0.28x Total number of students who took physics or math = Number of students who took physics + Number of students who took math = 0.2x + 0.28x = 0.48x We know that the total number of students is more than 501.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet be l and b respectively. When folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm. This means that the length of each part is (48/2) - b = 24 - b. Similarly, when folded along the other set of sides, the length of each part is (66/2) - l = 33 - l. Now, we know that the length of each part is the same, so we can equate them: 24 - b = 33 - l l - b = 9 We also know that the perimeter of the rectangular sheet is 2(l + b). Substituting l - b = 9, we get: 2(l + b) = 2(l + (l - 9)) = 4l - 18 4l = 2(l + b) + 18 2l = l + b + 9 l = (b + 9)/2 Now, we can substitute this value of l in the equation l - b = 9 to get: (b + 9)/2 - b = 9 b = 12 Substituting b = 12 in the equation l = (b + 9)/2, we get l = 10.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We know that Ram and Krishna are traveling towards each other, so their relative speed is the sum of their speeds, which is 20 m/s + 40 m/s = 60 m/s. We also know that they meet at point C after 10 seconds. Let's call the distance from A to C \"x\" and the distance from C to B \"y\".

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the time taken by train M to travel from City A to the point where the two trains cross each other. Train M starts at 5 am and reaches City B at 9 am, so it takes 4 hours to cover the distance between the two cities. Let's call the distance between the two cities \"d\". Therefore, the speed of train M is d/4. Next, we need to find the time taken by train N to travel from City B to the point where the two trains cross each other. Train N starts at 7 am and reaches City A at 10:30 am, so it takes 3.5 hours to cover the distance between the two cities. Therefore, the speed of train N is d/3.5. Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / relative speed The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds, since they are travelling towards each other. Therefore, the relative speed is d/4 + d/3.5. We can simplify this to get the relative speed as (7d/14) + (8d/14) = (15d/14). The distance between the two cities is the same for both trains, so we can use the same distance \"d\" for both trains. Therefore, the time taken for the two trains to cross each other is: time = d / (15d/14) = 14/15 hours = 56 minutes Therefore, the answer is (D) 56 minutes. The answer is D.",

Then, the number of students who study math is 0.0625 x 1000 = 62.5 (which we can round up to 63), the number of students who study bio is 0.1 x 1000 = 100, and the number of students who study English is 0.125 x 1000 = 125.\n\nStep 3: The total number of students is the sum of the number of students who study each subject: 63 + 100 + 125 = 288.\n\nStep 4: We need to find the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students. The minimum number of students is 1000 (our assumption from step 2), and the maximum number of students is the next highest 4-digit number that is divisible by 288.

We also know that the overall class average was 76, so the total marks obtained by the class = 76(p+f). We can set up the equation: (83p + 55f)/(p+f) = 76 Simplifying this equation, we get: 83p + 55f = 76(p+f) 7p = 21f p = 3f So, the number of passing students is three times the number of failing students.

If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Step 1: Find the number of tagged deer in the 500 deer sample. Since the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, we can set up a proportion: \n\n(number of tagged deer in 500 deer sample) / 500 = (number of tagged deer in the forest) / (total deer population in the forest)\n\nWe know that 20 deer in the 500 deer sample were tagged, so:\n\n20/500 = (number of tagged deer in the forest) / (total deer population in the forest)\n\nStep 2: Solve for the number of tagged deer in the forest. \n\n20/500 = (number of tagged deer in the forest) / (total deer population in the forest)\n\n0.04 = (number of tagged deer in the forest) / (total deer population in the forest)\n\n0.04 x (total deer population in the forest) = number of tagged deer in the forest\n\nStep 3: Find the total deer population in the forest. \n\nWe know that 300 deer were tagged in 2001, so the total number of tagged deer in the forest is 300 + (number of tagged deer in the forest from 2002). \n\nSubstituting this into the equation we found in Step 2: \n\n0.04 x (total deer population in the forest) = 300 + (number of tagged deer in the forest from 2002)\n\n0.04 x (total deer population in the forest) = 300 + 0.04 x (total deer population in the forest)\n\n0.96 x (total deer population in the forest) = 300\n\n(total deer population in the forest) = 300 / 0.96\n\n(total deer population in the forest) = 312.5\n\nTherefore, the total deer population in the forest is approximately 312.5.

Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can get a 4% discount if he pays within 30 days, or he can pay the full amount within n days. Let's assume that the merchant borrows money to pay the invoice and takes advantage of the discount. Then, he will have to pay 96% of the invoice amount, which is $20,000 * 0.96 = $19,200. Let's assume that he borrows the money for n days at a simple interest rate of r%. Then, the interest he will have to pay is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time / 100 = $19,200 * r * n / 36500 Now, he can afford to borrow money only if the interest he pays is less than the discount he gets. Therefore, we have: $20,000 * 0.04 > $19,200 * r * n / 36500 Simplifying this equation, we get: r * n < 247.67 Therefore, the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money is 247.67 / n.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. Let's assume the original price of an item is $100. With a 20% discount, the selling price becomes 80% of the original price, which is $80. Now, the shopkeeper wants to sell the item at the original price of $100. So, the shopkeeper needs to increase the selling price from $80 to $100. The increase in price is $20. To find the percentage increase, we need to divide the increase by the original price and multiply by 100. Percentage increase = (Increase in price / Original price) x 100 Percentage increase = ($20 / $80) x 100 Percentage increase = 25% Therefore, the shopkeeper must increase the price by 25% to sell the item at the original price. Hence, the correct answer is option (C) 25%.",

Let's assume that the length of the painted sides is l and the width of the parking space is w. We are given that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet. Therefore, the length of the parking space is l + 9 feet. We are also given that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation: 2l + w = 37 feet. We can rearrange this equation to get w in terms of l: w = 37 - 2l feet. Now, we can substitute this value of w in terms of l in the expression for the area of the parking space: Area = (l + 9)w = (l + 9)(37 - 2l) square feet. We want to maximize the area of the parking space. To do this, we can take the derivative of the expression for the area with respect to l and set it equal to zero: d(Area)/dl = -4l + 208 = 0 Solving for l, we get l = 52 feet. Therefore, the width of the parking space is w = 37 - 2l = -47 feet. This is not a valid solution since the width cannot be negative. Therefore, the maximum area occurs at the endpoint of the feasible region, which is when l = 18 feet. Therefore, the width of the parking space is w = 37 - 2l = 1 feet.

This means that 0 \u2264 {2x} < 1 and 0 \u2264 {2y} < 1, where {x} and {y} denote the fractional parts of x and y, respectively. Therefore, we have: [2x] = [x] + [x] [2y] = [y] + [y] Substituting these expressions into the equation above, we get: [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [x] + [x] + [y] + [y] This simplifies to: [x + y] = [x] + [y] This equation holds if and only if the fractional parts of x and y add up to less than 1. For example, if x = 1.3 and y = 2.4, then L(x,y) = R(x,y) = 5. However, if x = 1.6 and y = 2.7, then L(x,y) = 5 and R(x,y) = 6, so the equation does not hold. Therefore, option A is not possible.

So, we can write: 0.6 (1 + x) = 0.4 + x Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.6 + 0.6x = 0.4 + x 0.2x = 0.2 x = 1 Therefore, we need to add 1 gallon of orange juice to the soft drink to make the orange juice 60% of the new mixture.

How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the rate of filling of hose A is x units per hour and the rate of filling of hose B is y units per hour. We know that hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours. Therefore, the total amount of water in the pool is 8x units. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours. Therefore, the amount of water filled by hose A in the first 2 hours is 2x units. The remaining amount of water in the pool is 8x - 2x = 6x units. Now, both hoses A and B work together to fill the remaining 6x units of water in 3 hours. Therefore, the combined rate of filling of both hoses is 6x/3 = 2x units per hour. We can set up an equation based on the principle that the amount of water filled by both hoses together is equal to the amount of water remaining in the pool. Amount of water filled by both hoses together = Amount of water remaining in the pool Rate of filling of both hoses x Time taken by both hoses = 6x 2x * 3 = 6x x = 1.5 Therefore, the rate of filling of hose B is 1.5 - x = 0.5 units per hour. Therefore, hose B would take 8x/0.5 = 16 hours to fill the entire pool. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is not given in the answer choices.",

According to the question, if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a., they will receive equal amounts on attaining the age of 26 years. Let the amount they receive be y. Using the formula for compound interest, we can write: y = x(1 + 0.04)^3 = x(1.124864) (since Mohan is 23 years old and the investment is for 3 years) y = (5100 - x)(1 + 0.04)^2 = (5100 - x)(1.0816) (since Sohan is 24 years old and the investment is for 2 years) Equating y, we get: x(1.124864) = (5100 - x)(1.0816) Solving this equation, we get: x = Rs. 2500 Therefore, Mohan's share is Rs. 2500.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's start by finding the total amount of money exchanged during the game. Each flip of the coin results in a net exchange of $1 from Jonathan to Christopher (since $2 is exchanged for a head and $3 is exchanged for a tail). Since there were 20 flips, the total amount exchanged is $20. However, we know that the net exchange was zero, so the number of heads must be equal to the number of tails. Let's assume that the number of heads is x. Then, the number of tails is 20 - x. The total amount exchanged can be expressed as follows: \n\n2x + 3(20 - x) = 20 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n2x + 60 - 3x = 20 \n\n-x = -40 \n\nx = 40 \n\nTherefore, the number of heads is 40/2 = 20. \n\nSo, the coin landed on heads 20 times.

Therefore, we have:\n\nL x W = 240\n\nWe also know that Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. This means that the perimeter of the yard that needs fencing is:\n\nP = 2L + W - 10\n\nWe subtract 10 from the perimeter because one side of 10 meters is not fenced. We can simplify this expression by using the formula for the area of the yard:\n\nP = 2L + W - 10\nP = 2(L + W) - 10\nP = 2(240/W + W) - 10\n\nNow we can substitute the value of P into the formula for the perimeter of the yard:\n\nP = 2(240/W + W) - 10\nP = 480/W + 2W - 10\n\nWe want to minimize the amount of fencing needed, so we need to find the value of W that minimizes the perimeter.

            "Question": "Q: The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 28 (C) 30 (D) 53 (E) 59",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's first find out how many times the number of water lilies doubles to reach the final number. If there is one water lily initially and it doubles every two days, then after 2 days there will be 2 lilies, after 4 days there will be 4 lilies, after 6 days there will be 8 lilies, and so on. We can see that the number of lilies doubles every 2 days. Let's say the number of times the number of lilies doubles is n. Then, we can set up the equation: 1 x 2^n = final number of lilies We know that the final number of lilies is 60 x 2, because it doubles every 2 days for 60 days. So, we can rewrite the equation as: 2^n = 120 Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get: n log 2 = log 120 n = log 120 / log 2 n \u2248 6.91 So, the number of times the number of lilies doubles is approximately 6.91. This means that the initial number of lilies (64) doubles 6.91 times to reach the final number of lilies. So, we can set up the equation: 64 x 2^6.91 = final number of lilies Solving for the final number of lilies, we get: final number of lilies \u2248 22,528 Now, we need to find out how many days it takes for the number of lilies to reach 22,528, starting from 64 lilies and doubling every 2 days. Let's say it takes d days. Then, we can set up the equation: 64 x 2^(d/2) = 22,528 Solving for d, we get: d \u2248 28. Therefore, it takes approximately 28 days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies, starting from 64 lilies. The answer is (B) 28.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the area of the square paper. The area of a square is given by the formula A = s^2, where s is the length of a side. So, the area of the square paper is 20^2 = 400 square cm.\n\nNext, we need to find the area of the two semi-circles. The diameter of each semi-circle is equal to the length of a side of the square, which is 20 cm. The formula for the area of a semi-circle is A = (\u03c0r^2)/2, where r is the radius of the semi-circle. Since the diameter is 20 cm, the radius is 10 cm. So, the area of one semi-circle is (\u03c0 x 10^2)/2 = 50\u03c0/2 = 25\u03c0 square cm. The area of two semi-circles is therefore 50\u03c0 square cm.\n\nWhen we cut out the two semi-circles, we are left with a square with two quarter-circles removed. The area of each quarter-circle is (\u03c0r^2)/4, where r is the radius of the quarter-circle. Since the diameter of each quarter-circle is 20 cm, the radius is 10 cm. So, the area of each quarter-circle is (\u03c0 x 10^2)/4 = 25\u03c0/4 square cm. The area of two quarter-circles is therefore 25\u03c0/2 square cm.\n\nThe area of the remaining paper is the area of the square paper minus the area of the two semi-circles plus the area of the two quarter-circles. So, the area of the remaining paper is:\n\n400 - 50\u03c0 + 25\u03c0/2\n\nWe can simplify this expression by finding a common denominator for 50 and 2:\n\n400 - (50\u03c0 x 2)/2 + 25\u03c0/2\n\n400 - 50\u03c0 + 25\u03c0/2\n\nNow, we can factor out 25\u03c0/2:\n\n400 + 25\u03c0/2 - 50\u03c0\n\n400 - 25\u03c0/2\n\nThis is approximately equal to 8.79 square cm.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. \n\nLet's assume that the customer needs to replace four tires. \n\nOption 1: Purchase new tires at a cost of $180 per tire. \n\nTotal cost of new tires = $180 x 4 = $720 \n\nSince the new tires last for four years, the average cost per year = $720 / 4 = $180 \n\nOption 2: Repair current tires at a cost of $40 per tire. \n\nTotal cost of repairing tires = $40 x 4 = $160 \n\nSince the repaired tires last for one additional year, the total lifespan of the tires is five years. \n\nTotal cost of repairing tires for five years = $160 x 5 = $800 \n\nAverage cost per year = $800 / 5 = $160 \n\nNow, let's calculate the percentage increase in the average cost per year of new tires compared to the cost of repairing current tires. \n\nPercentage increase = [(New cost per year - Repair cost per year) / Repair cost per year] x 100 \n\nPercentage increase = [(180 - 160) / 160] x 100 \n\nPercentage increase = (20 / 160) x 100 \n\nPercentage increase = 12.5% \n\nTherefore, the average cost per year of new tires is 12.5% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires. \n\nHence, the correct answer is option (C) 12.5%.",

Since the thickness of the cube is 1 cm, the inner cube of side length 3 cm (5 cm - 2 cm) is made up of smaller cubes of side length 1 cm. Therefore, the number of smaller cubes in the inner cube is 3^3 = 27. The number of smaller cubes on the outer layer of the inner cube is 20 (since the inner cube has 6 faces, and the outer layer consists of the 4 edges of each face, which is 4 x 6 = 24 cubes, minus the 4 corners, which are counted twice). Therefore, the total number of smaller cubes that have at least one face painted is 6 x 5^2 - 20 = 130. Since the total number of smaller cubes is 5^3 = 125, the number of smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 125 - 130 = -5. This is not a valid answer, so we must have made a mistake in our calculations.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Step 1: Find the number of voters who are eligible to vote. 20% of 5,000 = 1,000 voters are not eligible to vote. So, the number of voters who are eligible to vote is 5,000 - 1,000 = 4,000 voters.\n\nStep 2: Find the number of votes required to win. The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes. So, the number of votes required to win is (15/100) x 4,000 = 600 votes.\n\nStep 3: Find the total number of votes the winning candidate got. Let's assume that the winning candidate got x votes. The other candidate got (4,000 - x) votes.\n\nStep 4: We know that the winning candidate got 15% more votes than the other candidate.

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get: 1397 = (a - b)N Solving for N, we get: N = 1397 / (a - b) Since N is a 3-digit number, a - b must be a factor of 1397. The prime factors of 1397 are 1397 and 1. Therefore, a - b can only be 1 or 1397. If a - b = 1, then N = 1397, which is a 4-digit number. Therefore, a - b must be 1397. Since a and b are the quotients when 2272 and 875 are divided by N, respectively, we know that a < N and b < N. Therefore, the maximum value of a - b is N - 1. Setting N - 1 = 1397, we get: N = 1398 The sum of the digits of N is 1 + 3 + 9 + 8 = 21. Therefore, the answer is not among the answer choices. The correct answer is None of the above.",

We know that A can construct the wall in 40 minutes, so their rate of work is 1/40. Similarly, B can construct the wall in 45 minutes, so their rate of work is 1/45. Adding their individual rates of work, we get: 1/40 + 1/45 = 9/360 + 8/360 = 17/360 So their combined rate of work is 17/360. Multiplying their individual times, we get: 40 * 45 = 1800.

Simplifying these equations, we get: h = x h/\u221a3 = h/(x + d) Solving for d, we get: d = x(\u221a3 - 1) Now, we need to find x. We know that the angle of elevation changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 in 10 minutes. This means that the car covers the distance x in 10 minutes. Let's convert this to hours: 10 minutes = 10/60 hours = 1/6 hours We also know that the car is moving at a uniform speed. Let the speed be v. Then, we can set up the equation: x = v * (1/6) Solving for v, we get: v = 6x Now, we can substitute the value of v in the expression for d: d = x(\u221a3 - 1) = (6x)(\u221a3 - 1) = 6x\u221a3 - 6x Finally, we need to simplify this expression to match one of the answer choices: d = 6x\u221a3 - 6x = 6x(\u221a3 - 1) Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 7(\u221a3 \u2013 1).

            "Question": "Q: All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's start by using a Venn diagram to represent the information given in the problem. We know that all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both, so we can represent this with a rectangle that contains two overlapping circles. Let's call the number of files infected only by a virus \"V\", the number of files infected only by a worm \"W\", and the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm \"B\". We know that W = 2.5B, so we can represent this relationship in the Venn diagram by making the circle representing worms 2.5 times larger than the overlap between the two circles. We also know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so we can represent this by making the circle representing viruses half the size of the rectangle. \n\nNow, we can use the information in the Venn diagram to set up some equations. We know that:\n\n- V + B = 0.5(250) = 125 (since 50% of the files were not infected by a virus)\n- W + B = 250 (since all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both)\n- W = 2.5B\n\nWe want to find the number of files that were not infected by a worm, which is equal to the number of files that were infected only by a virus. We can find this by subtracting B from V:\n\n- V - B = V - (W/2.5) = (2.5V - W)/2.5\n\nSo, we need to find the value of (2.5V - W)/2.5. We can do this by solving for V and W in terms of B, and then substituting into the expression:\n\n- V + B = 125\n- W + B = 250\n- W = 2.5B\n\nSubstituting W = 2.5B into the second equation, we get:\n\n- 2.5B + B = 250\n- 3.5B = 250\n- B = 71.43 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSubstituting B = 71.43 into the first equation, we get:\n\n- V + 71.43 = 125\n- V = 53.57 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSubstituting V = 53.57 and W = 2.5B = 178.57 into the expression (2.5V - W)/2.5, we get:\n\n- (2.5(53.57) - 178.57)/2.5 = -50\n\nThis means that there were 50 files that were infected only by a worm and not by a virus, so the number of files that were not infected by a worm is:\n\n- 125 - 50 = 75\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 75.

Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the volume of the coin made of aluminum and silver. The volume of the coin can be calculated as the volume of a cylinder with height 2 mm and radius 7.5 mm (half of the diameter). Volume of the coin = \u03c0 x (7.5 mm)^2 x 2 mm = 352.5 mm^3 Let's assume the volume of aluminum in the coin is x mm^3. Since the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, the volume of silver in the coin is also x mm^3. Let's assume the density of aluminum is y g/cm^3. Then, the weight of aluminum in the coin is: weight of aluminum = volume of aluminum x density of aluminum = (x/1000) cm^3 x y g/cm^3 = xy/1000 g Similarly, the weight of silver in the coin is: weight of silver = volume of silver x density of silver = (x/1000) cm^3 x 2y g/cm^3 = 2xy/1000 g The total weight of the coin is given as 30 grams. So, we can set up the equation: weight of aluminum + weight of silver = 30 grams xy/1000 + 2xy/1000 = 30 grams 3xy/1000 = 30 grams xy = 10000 mm^3 g/cm^3 (since 1 cm^3 = 1000 mm^3) xy = 10 g/cm^3 Now, we need to find the weight of a pure aluminum coin measuring 1 x 30 mm. The volume of this coin can be calculated as the volume of a cylinder with height 1 mm and radius 15 mm. Volume of the pure aluminum coin = \u03c0 x (15 mm)^2 x 1 mm = 225\u03c0 mm^3 Let's assume the density of pure aluminum is z g/cm^3. Then, the weight of the pure aluminum coin is: weight of pure aluminum coin = volume of pure aluminum x density of pure aluminum = (225\u03c0/1000) cm^3 x z g/cm^3 = 0.225\u03c0z g We know that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum. So, we can set up the equation: 10 g/cm^3 / z g/cm^3 = 2 z = 5 g/cm^3 Now, we can substitute the value of z in the weight equation: weight of pure aluminum coin = 0.225\u03c0z g = 0.225\u03c0 x 5 g = 3.53 g (approx) Therefore, the weight of the pure aluminum coin measuring 1 x 30 mm is approximately 3.53 grams.
