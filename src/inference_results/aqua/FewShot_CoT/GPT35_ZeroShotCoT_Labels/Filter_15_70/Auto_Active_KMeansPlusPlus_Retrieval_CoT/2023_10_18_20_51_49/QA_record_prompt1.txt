Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the yacht per hour. On a particular day, he finishes two-thirds of the work, which means he cleaned 2/3 of the yacht. The remaining 1/3 of the yacht is cleaned by Jill. \n\nLet's first find out how long it takes Jack to clean 2/3 of the yacht. We know that his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the yacht per hour, so we can set up the equation:\n\n(1/12) * t = 2/3\n\nwhere t is the time it takes Jack to clean 2/3 of the yacht. Solving for t, we get:\n\nt = (2/3) / (1/12) = 8\n\nSo Jack takes 8 hours to clean 2/3 of the yacht. \n\nNow we need to find out how long it takes Jill to clean the remaining 1/3 of the yacht. We know that Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of what Jack can do, which means her rate of cleaning is:\n\n(5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240\n\nSo Jill's rate of cleaning is 1/240 of the yacht per hour. Let's set up the equation:\n\n(1/240) * t = 1/3\n\nwhere t is the time it takes Jill to clean 1/3 of the yacht.

Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes, which means it makes 1 full rotation in 7 minutes. We want to find the time at which both balls are at the same starting point again, which means they have completed the same number of rotations. Let's say they both complete n rotations. The time it takes for ball A to complete n rotations is 13n minutes, and the time it takes for ball B to complete n rotations is 7n minutes. We want to find the smallest value of n such that 13n and 7n differ by a multiple of 360 degrees (i.e., they are at the same starting point again). Let's write this as an equation: 13n - 7n = k * 360, where k is an integer. Simplifying this equation, we get: 6n = k * 360 n = k * 60 The smallest value of k that makes n an integer is k = 1, which gives us n = 60. Therefore, both balls will be at the same starting point again after 60 rotations. The time it takes for ball A to complete 60 rotations is 13 * 60 = 780 minutes, or 13 hours. The time it takes for ball B to complete 60 rotations is 7 * 60 = 420 minutes, or 7 hours.

Squaring both sides, we get x^6 > y^4. \n\nNow, let's consider each option: \n\n(A) x > y: We cannot determine the relationship between x and y based on the given information. For example, if x = -2 and y = 1, then x < y. But if x = -1 and y = 2, then x > y. Therefore, option A is not necessarily true. \n\n(B) y^2 > x^2: We cannot determine the relationship between y^2 and x^2 based on the given information. For example, if x = -2 and y = 1, then y^2 < x^2. But if x = -1 and y = 2, then y^2 > x^2. Therefore, option B is not necessarily true. \n\n(C) -x^3 < y^2: We know that x^6 > y^4, so taking the square root of both sides, we get x^3 > y^2. Since x is negative, we can rewrite this as -x^3 < |y^2|. Therefore, option C is true. \n\n(D) \u2013x < y: We cannot determine the relationship between -x and y based on the given information. For example, if x = -2 and y = 1, then -x < y. But if x = -3 and y = 2, then -x > y.

We know that the total time taken for the whole journey is 1 hour. So, we can set up the equation: t + (1-t) = 1 Solving for t, we get: t = 0.5 This means that Winson ran for half an hour and walked for half an hour. Now, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time For the running part of the journey, the distance is 'd' miles, the speed is 10 miles/hr, and the time is 0.5 hours. So, the distance covered during the running part of the journey is: distance = speed x time = 10 x 0.5 = 5 miles For the walking part of the journey, the distance is 'd' miles, the speed is 5 miles/hr, and the time is 0.5 hours. So, the distance covered during the walking part of the journey is: distance = speed x time = 5 x 0.5 = 2.5 miles The total distance covered during the whole journey is the sum of the distances covered during the running and walking parts of the journey: total distance = 5 + 2.5 = 7.5 miles Rounding off to the nearest integer, we get the answer as (B) 6.

Let's call Rahim's age 5 years back as x. So, 5 years back, we can set up the equation: R = (1/3)x Simplifying, we get: x = 3R Now, we need to find Rahim's current age. Rahim's current age would be (x + 5 + 5), since 5 years have passed since 5 years back. Substituting the value of x, we get: Rahim's current age = 3R + 10 We know that Raj is 17 years old now. Substituting this value in the equation R = (1/3)x, we get: 17 = (1/3)x x = 51 Substituting the value of x in the equation Rahim's current age = 3R + 10, we get: Rahim's current age = 3(17) + 10 = 61 years Hence, the correct answer is (E) 43.

Therefore, the area of each triangle is (1/2)(x^2 - 4x)/2 = 70. \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nx^2 - 4x = 280 \n\nx^2 - 4x - 280 = 0 \n\nWe can solve for x using the quadratic formula: \n\nx = (4 \u00b1 sqrt(4^2 + 4(280)))/2 \n\nx = (4 \u00b1 sqrt(1136))/2 \n\nx = 2 \u00b1 sqrt(284) \n\nSince the length of one side of the original square cannot be negative, we take the positive value: \n\nx = 2 + sqrt(284) \n\nNow we can find the perimeter of the original square by multiplying the length of one side by 4: \n\nPerimeter = 4x = 4(2 + sqrt(284)) = 8 + 4sqrt(284) \n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) 64.",

Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so his rate of work is 1/9 toys per hour. \n\nThe combined rate of work of Alex and Jacob is: \n\n1/7 + 1/9 = 16/63 toys per hour \n\nStep 2: Find the total number of hours worked by Alex and Jacob. \n\nLet the total number of hours worked by Alex be x. Since both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours, let the total number of hours worked by Jacob be x + d, where d is a small difference. \n\nSo, the total number of toys made by Alex and Jacob is: \n\n(1/7)x + (1/9)(x + d) = 35 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 63 (the LCM of 7 and 9), we get: \n\n9x + 7x + 7d = 2205 \n\n16x + 7d = 2205 \n\nStep 3: Find the number of toys made by Jacob. \n\nWe want to find the number of toys made by Jacob, which is (1/9)(x + d). \n\nFrom step 2, we know that: \n\n16x + 7d = 2205 \n\nSolving for d, we get: \n\nd = (2205 - 16x)/7 \n\nSubstituting this value of d in (1/9)(x + d), we get: \n\n(1/9)(x + d) = (1/9)(x + (2205 - 16x)/7) \n\nSimplifying this expression, we get: \n\n(1/9)(x + d) = (1/9)(2205/7 - 7x/7) \n\n(1/9)(x + d) = (1/9)(315 - x) \n\nx + d = 315 - x \n\n2x + d = 315 \n\nSubstituting the value of d, we get: \n\n2x + (2205 - 16x)/7 = 315 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 7, we get: \n\n14x + 2205 - 16x = 2205 \n\n-2x = -0 \n\nx = 0 \n\nSubstituting the value of x in (1/9)(x + d), we get: \n\n(1/9)(x + d) = (1/9)(d) \n\nFrom step 2, we know that (1/7)x + (1/9)(x + d) = 35.

Therefore, the number of women who took the survey is 0.6x. This means that the number of men who took the survey is 0.4x. We also know that 75% of the men who were surveyed preferred red cars over green cars. This means that 25% of the men who were surveyed preferred green cars over red cars. We are given that 10 men liked green cars more than red. Therefore, the number of men who preferred red cars is: 0.75(0.4x) = 0.3x. This means that the number of men who preferred green cars is: 0.25(0.4x) = 0.1x. We can set up an equation to solve for \"x\": 0.6x + 0.4x = 0.3x + 0.1x + 10 Simplifying the equation, we get: 1x = 200 Therefore, the total number of people who took the survey is 200.

Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 50% (D) 65% (E) 75%",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume the current population of Boomtown is \"x\". According to the problem, the population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. So, after one year, the population will be 1.1x, and after two years, the population will be 1.1(1.1x) = 1.21x. The problem states that the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. So, we can set up an equation: 2(1.1x) = 1.21x. Solving for x, we get x = 20. Therefore, the current population of Boomtown is 20. Now, we can calculate the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year: Percent increase = ((New value - Old value) / Old value) * 100 = ((1.1x - x) / x) * 100 = 10%.

Train A starts at 11 am and Train B starts at 2 pm, which means Train A has been traveling for 3 hours before Train B starts. In 3 hours, Train A covers a distance of 40 x 3 = 120 km. Now, let's assume that the two trains meet after t hours. In that case, Train A would have traveled for t + 3 hours and Train B would have traveled for t hours. Let's use the formula: distance = speed x time Distance covered by Train A + Distance covered by Train B = Total distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow 40(t+3) + 72t = D where D is the total distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow. We don't know the value of D, but we can simplify the equation by using the fact that Train B starts from the same point as Train A and is traveling towards it. Therefore, the total distance between the two trains when they meet is equal to the total distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow. We know that the total distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow is 1200 km. Therefore, we can substitute D = 1200 km in the equation: 40(t+3) + 72t = 1200 Simplifying the equation, we get: 112t = 960 t = 8.57 So the two trains will meet after 8.57 hours, which is approximately 8 hours and 34 minutes.

Then, the interest he will have to pay is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time / 100 = $19,200 * r * n / 36500 Now, he can afford to borrow money only if the interest he pays is less than the discount he gets. Therefore, we have: $20,000 * 0.04 > $19,200 * r * n / 36500 Simplifying this equation, we get: r * n < 247.67 Therefore, the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money is 247.67 / n. Since we don't know the value of n, we cannot determine the exact value of r. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Cannot be determined. The answer is D.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. Let's assume that the original price of an item is $100. With a 20% discount, the selling price becomes 80% of the original price, which is $80. Now, the shopkeeper wants to sell the item at the original price of $100 the next day. To calculate the percentage increase required, we need to find the difference between the original price and the discounted price, divide it by the discounted price, and multiply by 100. Percentage increase = ((Original price - Discounted price) / Discounted price) x 100 Percentage increase = ((100 - 80) / 80) x 100 Percentage increase = (20 / 80) x 100 Percentage increase = 25% Therefore, the shopkeeper must increase the price by 25% to sell the item at the original price the next day.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's say the rate of filling of hose A is x, and the rate of filling of hose B is y. We know that hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, so its rate of filling is 1/8 of the pool per hour. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours, so the amount of water filled by hose A alone in 2 hours is (1/8) * 2 = 1/4 of the pool. The remaining amount of water to be filled is 3/4 of the pool. We know that both hoses, working together, finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. So, the total time taken to fill the remaining 3/4 of the pool by both hoses working together is 3 hours. We can use the formula: rate * time = work done Let's say the rate of filling of both hoses working together is z. So, we have: (x + y) * 3/4 = z * 3 Solving for z, we get: z = (x + y) / 4 Now, we know that the total amount of water filled by both hoses working together is 3/4 of the pool. So, we have: x * 2 + z * 3 = 3/4 Solving for z, we get: z = (3/4 - 2x) / 3 Substituting the value of z in terms of x and y, we get: (x + y) / 4 = (3/4 - 2x) / 3 Solving for y, we get: y = 3/4 - 2x - 4x/3 y = (9 - 8x) / 12 Therefore, hose B, working alone, can fill the entire pool in 12 / (9 - 8x) hours. We know that hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, so its rate of filling is 1/8 of the pool per hour. Let's assume that hose B can fill the pool in 'n' hours. So, its rate of filling is 1/n of the pool per hour. We can use the formula: rate * time = work done Let's say the total amount of water in the pool is 1 unit. Hose A filled 1/4 of the pool in 2 hours, so the amount of water filled by hose A in 1 hour is 1/8 * 1/4 = 1/32 of the pool. The remaining amount of water to be filled is 3/4 of the pool. We know that both hoses, working together, filled the remaining 3/4 of the pool in 3 hours. So, the rate of filling of both hoses working together is 3/4 * 1 / 3 = 1/4 of the pool per hour.

Therefore, the total amount they contributed was Rs. 96/x + 4(x-4). \n\nWe know that the total amount they contributed was equal to Rs. 96.

At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day? Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360",
            "Pred_Rationale": "If the store sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls, then it sold 0.8 x 600 = 480 golf balls. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it sold 240 of each. Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, it must have had 0 white golf balls left at the end of the day. Therefore, the store must have had 240 yellow golf balls left at the end of the day. Since the store started with 600 golf balls and sold 480, it must have had 120 golf balls left at the end of the day. Therefore, the store must have started with 120 - 240 = -120 white golf balls. This is impossible, so we made a mistake somewhere. The mistake is in assuming that the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls. Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, it must have had 0 white golf balls left at the end of the day. Therefore, the store must have sold 600 - 0 = 600 yellow golf balls. Since the store sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls, it must have started with 600 / 0.8 = 750 golf balls. Therefore, the store must have started with 750 - 600 = 150 white golf balls. Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, it must have sold 150 white golf balls. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it must have sold 150 yellow golf balls. Therefore, the store must have started with 600 - 150 = 450 yellow golf balls. Therefore, the correct answer is (None of the above) 450. The answer is None of the above.",

If 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, what percentage of all Daifu students are members of the swim team? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 30% (C) 40% (D) 50% (E) 60%",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Step 1: Let's assume that there are 100 students in Daifu university. Then, 24% of them are members of both a chess club and a swim team. So, the number of students who are members of both is: 24% of 100 = 24 students.\n\nStep 2: Let's assume that there are x students who are members of the swim team. Then, 20% of them are not members of the chess club. So, the number of students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club is: 20% of x = 0.2x.\n\nStep 3: We know that the total number of students who are members of both a chess club and a swim team is 24. So, the number of students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club is: 24 - (the number of students who are members of both but not the swim team).\n\nStep 4: We can set up an equation to solve for x, the total number of students who are members of the swim team:\n\nx - 0.2x = 24 - (the number of students who are members of both but not the swim team)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n0.8x = 24 - (the number of students who are members of both but not the swim team)\n\nStep 5: We don't know the number of students who are members of both but not the swim team, but we do know that it is less than or equal to 24 (since 24 is the total number of students who are members of both). So, the maximum value of the right-hand side of the equation is 24. Therefore, the minimum value of x is:\n\n0.8x = 24 - 24 = 0\n\nThis means that there are no students who are members of the swim team. However, this is not a possible answer, since we know that there are students who are members of both a chess club and a swim team. Therefore, we made a mistake somewhere in our calculations.\n\nStep 6: Let's go back to Step 2 and assume that there are y students who are members of the chess club. Then, 24% of them are members of both a chess club and a swim team. So, the number of students who are members of both is: 24% of y = 0.24y.\n\nStep 7: We know that the total number of students who are members of both a chess club and a swim team is 24. So, the number of students who are members of the chess club but not the swim team is: 0.24y - 24.\n\nStep 8: We can set up an equation to solve for x, the total number of students who are members of the swim team:\n\nx - 0.2x = 24 - (0.24y - 24)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n0.8x = 48 - 0.24y\n\nStep 9: Let's assume that there are 100 students in Daifu university again. Then, the percentage of students who are members of the swim team is:\n\nx/100 x 100% = x%\n\nStep 10: We need to express x in terms of y, since we don't know x but we do know y. From Step 8, we have:\n\n0.8x = 48 - 0.24y\n\nDividing both sides by 0.8, we get:\n\nx = 60 - 0.3y\n\nStep 11: Substituting this expression for x into the equation in Step 9, we get:\n\nx/100 x 100% = (60 - 0.3y)/100 x 100% = 60% - 0.3y%\n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) 60%.

From the given information, we can write two equations: Equation 1: x + 2y = 150 (one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents) Equation 2: 2x + 3y = 300 (two sodas and three energy bars for 300 cents) We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y. Multiplying Equation 1 by 2 and subtracting it from Equation 2, we get: 2x + 3y - 2x - 4y = 300 - 300  y = 50 Substituting y = 50 in Equation 1, we get: x + 2(50) = 150 x = 50 Therefore, the cost of one soda is 50 cents and the cost of one energy bar is 50 cents. Now, we need to find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars. Cost of six sodas = 6x = 6(50) = 300 cents Cost of seven energy bars = 7y = 7(50) = 350 cents Total cost = 300 + 350 = 650 cents Therefore, the answer is None of the above, as none of the given options match the calculated total cost of 650 cents.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume the total sales revenue of Ace Book Company to be 100. Then, the revenue from the sale of novels is 34% of 100 = 34. The remaining revenue is 100 - 34 = 66. Out of this, 1/3 is from the sale of biographies. So, the revenue from the sale of biographies is (1/3) * 66 = 22. Now, we need to find how many times the revenue from the sale of novels is the revenue from the sale of biographies. This can be found by dividing the revenue from the sale of novels by the revenue from the sale of biographies. Therefore, the required ratio is 34/22 = 1.54 (approx). Hence, the answer is (B) 1.5.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The first train that comes could be either the main line train or the harbor line train. Let's consider the probability of the man catching each train separately.\n\nThe main line train starts at 5:00 AM and has a frequency of 10 minutes. This means that it will arrive at the station at 5:00 AM, 5:10 AM, 5:20 AM, and so on. The man arrives at the station sometime between 5:00 AM and 5:02 AM. The probability of him catching the main line train is the probability that he arrives at the station before or at the same time as the train. Since the train arrives every 10 minutes, the probability of him catching the train is 10/60 = 1/6.\n\nThe harbor line train starts at 5:02 AM and has a frequency of 10 minutes. This means that it will arrive at the station at 5:02 AM, 5:12 AM, 5:22 AM, and so on. The man arrives at the station sometime between 5:00 AM and 5:02 AM. The probability of him catching the harbor line train is the probability that he arrives at the station after the main line train has left but before the harbor line train arrives. Since the harbor line train arrives every 10 minutes, the probability of him catching the train is 8/60 = 2/15.\n\nTherefore, the overall probability of the man catching the first train that comes is the sum of the probabilities of him catching each train separately. Probability of catching the main line train = 1/6 Probability of catching the harbor line train = 2/15 Overall probability = 1/6 + 2/15 = 5/15 = 1/3\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is None of the above.

We want this distance to be 15 miles, so we can set up the equation: 3t = 15 Simplifying the equation, we get: t = 5 Therefore, it will take 5 hours for the two cars to be 15 miles apart.

If there is one water lily initially and it doubles every two days, then after 2 days there will be 2 water lilies, after 4 days there will be 4 water lilies, after 6 days there will be 8 water lilies, and so on. We can see that the number of water lilies doubles every 2 days, so after n days, the number of water lilies will be 2^(n/2). We want to find out how many days it will take for the lake to be fully covered with lilies if there are initially 64 water lilies.

Since there are (x-1) spaces between x pickets and each space is 6 inches wide, the total width of all the spaces is: (x-1)(6) = 6x - 6 inches Therefore, the total length of the fence is the sum of the total width of all the pickets and the total width of all the spaces: Total length = x/2 + 6x - 6 = 13x/2 - 6 inches Finally, we need to convert the length from inches to feet: Total length = (13x/2 - 6) / 12 = 13x/24 - 1/2 feet Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 13x/24.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the area of the square paper. The area of a square is given by the formula A = s^2, where s is the length of a side. So, the area of the square paper is 20^2 = 400 square cm.\n\nNext, we need to find the area of the two semi-circles. The diameter of each semi-circle is equal to the length of a side of the square, which is 20 cm. The formula for the area of a semi-circle is A = (\u03c0r^2)/2, where r is the radius of the semi-circle. Since the diameter is 20 cm, the radius is 10 cm. So, the area of one semi-circle is (\u03c0 x 10^2)/2 = 50\u03c0/2 = 25\u03c0 square cm. The area of two semi-circles is therefore 50\u03c0 square cm.\n\nWhen we cut out the two semi-circles, we are left with a square with two quarter-circles removed. The area of each quarter-circle is (\u03c0r^2)/4, where r is the radius of the quarter-circle. Since the diameter of each quarter-circle is 20 cm, the radius is 10 cm. So, the area of each quarter-circle is (\u03c0 x 10^2)/4 = 25\u03c0/4 square cm. The area of two quarter-circles is therefore 25\u03c0/2 square cm.\n\nThe area of the remaining paper is the area of the square paper minus the area of the two semi-circles plus the area of the two quarter-circles. So, the area of the remaining paper is:\n\n400 - 50\u03c0 + 25\u03c0/2\n\nWe can simplify this expression by finding a common denominator for 50 and 2:\n\n400 - (50\u03c0 x 2)/2 + 25\u03c0/2\n\n400 - 50\u03c0 + 25\u03c0/2\n\nNow, we can factor out 25\u03c0/2:\n\n400 + 25\u03c0/2 - 50\u03c0\n\n400 - 25\u03c0/2\n\nThis is approximately equal to 8.79 square cm.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. \n\nLet's assume that the customer needs to replace four tires. \n\nOption 1: Purchase new tires at a cost of $180 per tire. \n\nTotal cost of new tires = $180 x 4 = $720 \n\nSince the new tires last for four years, the average cost per year = $720 / 4 = $180 \n\nOption 2: Repair current tires at a cost of $40 per tire. \n\nTotal cost of repairing tires = $40 x 4 = $160 \n\nSince the repaired tires last for one additional year, the total lifespan of the tires is five years. \n\nTotal cost of repairing tires for five years = $160 x 5 = $800 \n\nAverage cost per year = $800 / 5 = $160 \n\nNow, let's calculate the percentage increase in the average cost per year of new tires compared to the cost of repairing current tires. \n\nPercentage increase = [(New cost per year - Repair cost per year) / Repair cost per year] x 100 \n\nPercentage increase = [(180 - 160) / 160] x 100 \n\nPercentage increase = (20 / 160) x 100 \n\nPercentage increase = 12.5% \n\nTherefore, the average cost per year of new tires is 12.5% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires. \n\nHence, the correct answer is option (C) 12.5%.",

The sum of these five numbers is:\n\nx + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8) = 5x + 20\n\nNext, we need to find a perfect square that is obtained when this sum is divided by 10. Let's express the sum as:\n\n5x + 20 = 5(x+4)\n\nSince the sum is divisible by 10, we know that x+4 must be an even number. Let's express x+4 as 2n, where n is an integer.

Since the thickness of the cube is 1 cm, the inner cube of side length 3 cm (5 cm - 2 cm) is made up of smaller cubes of side length 1 cm. Therefore, the number of smaller cubes in the inner cube is 3^3 = 27. The number of smaller cubes on the outer layer of the inner cube is 20 (since the inner cube has 6 faces, and the outer layer consists of the 4 edges of each face, which is 4 x 6 = 24 cubes, minus the 4 corners, which are counted twice). Therefore, the total number of smaller cubes that have at least one face painted is 6 x 5^2 - 20 = 130. Since the total number of smaller cubes is 5^3 = 125, the number of smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 125 - 130 = -5. This is not a valid answer, so we must have made a mistake somewhere. The mistake is in our calculation of the number of smaller cubes on the outer layer of the inner cube.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the common remainder be x. Then, we can write: 2272 = aN + x 875 = bN + x where a and b are the quotients when 2272 and 875 are divided by N, respectively. Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get: 1397 = (a - b)N Solving for N, we get: N = 1397 / (a - b) Since N is a 3-digit number, a - b must be a factor of 1397. The prime factors of 1397 are 1397 and 1. Therefore, a - b can only be 1396. We also know that a and b are less than 10, since N is a 3-digit number. We can try different values of a and b that satisfy a - b = 1396 and see if the sum of the digits of N is a constant. For example, if a = 9 and b = 2, then N = 1397 / 7 = 199. The sum of the digits of N is 1 + 9 + 9 = 19. If a = 8 and b = 1, then N = 1397 / 7 = 199. The sum of the digits of N is again 19.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the length and breadth of the rectangular plot.

We only need to know the total area of the boundary around the plot. Since the boundary is 1 metre wide on all sides, we can find its area by subtracting the area of the plot from the area of the rectangle formed by adding 2 metres to the length and breadth: Area of boundary = (length + 2) x (breadth + 2) - length x breadth = (length x breadth) + 2(length + breadth) + 4 - length x breadth = 2(length + breadth) + 4 Now we can calculate the cost of gardening the boundary at the rate of Rs. 10 per square metre: Cost of gardening the boundary = Area of boundary x Cost per sq m = (2(length + breadth) + 4) x 10 = (2 x 170 + 4) x 10 = 3440 Therefore, the cost of gardening the boundary is Rs. 3440.

From the given information, we can form the following equations: tan 45\u00b0 = h/x => h = x tan 45\u00b0 = x tan 60\u00b0 = (h + d)/x => h + d = x tan 60\u00b0 Substituting the value of h from the first equation, we get: x + d = x tan 60\u00b0 => d = x (tan 60\u00b0 - 1) We know that the car is moving at a uniform speed towards the base of the tower. Therefore, the ratio of the distance travelled by the car in the first 10 minutes to the total distance to be travelled is equal to the ratio of the time taken for the first 10 minutes to the total time taken. Let the total time taken be 't' minutes. Then, we have: 10/t = x/(x + d) => 10(x + d) = tx => t = 10(x + d)/x Substituting the value of d, we get: t = 10(x + x(tan 60\u00b0 - 1))/x => t = 10(1 + tan 60\u00b0)/(1 - tan 60\u00b0) = 10(\u221a3 + 1)/(\u221a3 - 1) = 5(\u221a3 + 1) minutes Therefore, the answer is (A) 5(\u221a3 + 1).

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's start by using a Venn diagram to represent the information given in the problem. \n\nWe know that there are 250 files in total, and that some of them are infected only by a virus, some are infected only by a worm, and some are infected by both. Let's call the number of files infected only by a virus \"V\", the number of files infected only by a worm \"W\", and the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm \"B\". \n\nFrom the problem, we know that: \n\n- W = 2.5B (the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm) \n- V + B = 125 (50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so the number of files infected by a virus is half of the total number of files) \n\nWe can use these two equations to solve for the values of V, W, and B. \n\nFirst, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get: \n\nV + (2.5B) + B = 125 \n\nSimplifying: \n\nV + 3.5B = 125 \n\nNext, we can use the fact that the total number of files is 250 to write another equation: \n\nV + W + B = 250 \n\nWe can substitute the first equation into this equation to get: \n\nV + (2.5B) + B = 250 \n\nSimplifying: \n\nV + 3.5B = 250 - W \n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (V and B). We can solve for one variable in terms of the other and substitute into the other equation to get a single equation with one variable. \n\nLet's solve the first equation for V: \n\nV = 125 - 3.5B \n\nSubstituting into the second equation: \n\n(125 - 3.5B) + 3.5B = 250 - W \n\nSimplifying: \n\n125 = 250 - W \n\nW = 125 \n\nSo all 125 files are infected by a worm. \n\nTo find the number of files that were not infected by a worm, we can subtract 125 from the total number of files: \n\n250 - 125 = 125 \n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) 125.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We need to break down the information given in the problem to find the length of the space shuttle. \n\nFirst, we know that the space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds at its maximum speed. This gives us the vertical speed of the shuttle: \n\nVertical speed = distance / time = 700 / 40 = 17.5 m/s \n\nNext, we know that it takes 5 seconds to pass a point. This means that the total time it takes for the shuttle to pass the point is 40 + 5 = 45 seconds. \n\nNow, we can use the total time and the vertical speed to find the length of the shuttle. Let's assume that the length of the shuttle is L. \n\nDuring the 40 seconds it takes to travel 700m vertically, the shuttle also travels a horizontal distance equal to its length L. \n\nSo, the total horizontal distance covered by the shuttle in 45 seconds is: \n\nTotal horizontal distance = horizontal distance covered in 40 seconds + distance covered in 5 seconds \n\nTotal horizontal distance = L + L = 2L \n\nWe can use the total horizontal distance and the time taken to find the horizontal speed of the shuttle: \n\nHorizontal speed = distance / time = (2L) / 45 \n\nNow, we can use the horizontal and vertical speeds to find the length of the shuttle: \n\nTotal speed = sqrt(horizontal speed^2 + vertical speed^2) \n\nTotal speed = sqrt((2L/45)^2 + (17.5)^2) \n\nWe know that the total speed is equal to the length of the shuttle divided by the time taken to pass the point: \n\nTotal speed = L / 5 \n\nSo, we can set these two equations equal to each other and solve for L: \n\nL / 5 = sqrt((2L/45)^2 + (17.5)^2) \n\nL = 125 meters (rounded to the nearest meter) \n\nTherefore, the length of the space shuttle is (D) 125 m.",

So, the volume of the coin is:\n\nV_coin = \u03c0 x (7.5 mm)^2 x 2 mm\nV_coin = 352.5 mm^3\n\nSince the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, we can assume that half of the volume of the coin is aluminum and the other half is silver. So, the volume of aluminum in the coin is:\n\nV_aluminum = V_coin / 2\nV_aluminum = 176.25 mm^3\n\nSince the density of aluminum is 2.7 g/cm^3, we can calculate the mass of the aluminum in the coin as:\n\nm_aluminum = V_aluminum x \u03c1_aluminum\nm_aluminum = 176.25 mm^3 x 2.7 g/cm^3\nm_aluminum = 476.175 g\n\nSince silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, its density is 2 x 2.7 g/cm^3 = 5.4 g/cm^3. Therefore, the volume of silver in the coin is also V_coin / 2 = 176.25 mm^3, and its mass is:\n\nm_silver = V_silver x \u03c1_silver\nm_silver = 176.25 mm^3 x 5.4 g/cm^3\nm_silver = 952.2 g\n\nThe total mass of the coin is the sum of the masses of aluminum and silver:\n\nm_coin = m_aluminum + m_silver\nm_coin = 476.175 g + 952.2 g\nm_coin = 1428.375 g\n\nNow, we need to find the weight of a pure aluminum coin with the same volume as the alloy coin.

We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of this diagonal line. Let's call the length of the rectangular solid's height \"h\".
