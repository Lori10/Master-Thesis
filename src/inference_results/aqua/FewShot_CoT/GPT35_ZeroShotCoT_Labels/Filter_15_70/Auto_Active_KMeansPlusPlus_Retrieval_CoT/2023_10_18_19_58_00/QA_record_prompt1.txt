Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the jar has a capacity of 10 units of candy (LCM of 5 and 10). If P eats alone, he can eat 1 unit of candy per minute (10/10). If Q eats alone, she can eat 1 unit of candy in 10/2 = 5 minutes (since she can finish half the jar in 5 minutes). Now, let's assume that both P and Q are eating together. Let's say the time taken for both of them to finish the jar is 't' minutes. So, in 't' minutes, P would have eaten 1t units of candy and Q would have eaten (10/2t) units of candy. Since both of them are eating the same jar, the total candy eaten in 't' minutes would be 1t + (10/2t) = (2t^2 + 10)/2t. We know that the jar has a capacity of 10 units of candy. So, (2t^2 + 10)/2t = 10 2t^2 + 10 = 20t t^2 - 5t + 5 = 0 Solving for t using the quadratic formula, we get: t = (5 \u00b1 sqrt(5))/2 Since t has to be positive, t = (5 + sqrt(5))/2 \u2248 3.8 Therefore, the answer is option (A) 4.

If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A is 100% each. Then, one gram of the health food contains 9% of vitamin E and 8% of vitamin A. To get 100% of vitamin E, we need to eat 100/9 grams of the health food. Similarly, to get 100% of vitamin A, we need to eat 100/8 grams of the health food. Since we need to get both vitamins from the same food, we need to take the least common multiple of 100/9 and 100/8, which is 25/9. Therefore, we need to eat (100/9) x (25/9) grams of the health food to get 100% of vitamin E and (100/8) x (25/9) grams of the health food to get 100% of vitamin A. Simplifying this, we get: (100/9) x (25/9) + (100/8) x (25/9) = (2500/72) grams \u2248 34.72 grams. Therefore, we need to eat at least 34.72 grams of the health food daily to get the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins. However, this is not one of the answer choices.

Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the yacht per hour. On a particular day, he finishes two-thirds of the work, so the remaining one-third of the work is left. Let's say Jill takes x hours to finish the remaining one-third of the work. \n\nSince Jack finished two-thirds of the work, the remaining one-third of the work will take 1/3 of the time it takes Jack to clean the yacht. So, the time it takes Jill to finish the remaining one-third of the work can be found by setting up the equation:\n\n(1/12) * (1/3) * (12) + (1/12) * x * (5/100) = (1/3)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n1/36 + (x/240) = 1/3\n\nMultiplying both sides by 240, we get:\n\n240/36 + x = 80\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx = 80 - 20/3\n\nx = 58.33\n\nTherefore, it takes Jill approximately 58.33 hours to finish the remaining one-third of the work.

To do this, we can use Euler's totient function, which gives the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. \n\nEuler's totient function is given by: \n\n\u03c6(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere n is a positive integer and p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n. \n\nUsing this formula, we can find \u03c6(1000): \n\n\u03c6(1000) = 1000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5) \n\n\u03c6(1000) = 400 \n\nTherefore, there are 400 numbers in S that are relatively prime to 1000. \n\nFinally, we can find the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1000 by dividing the number of integers in S that are relatively prime to 1000 by the total number of integers in S: \n\nProbability = 400/1000 = 2/5 \n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 2/5.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. Let's assume that the original price of the tubeless tyre is $100. The manufacturer is offering a 20% discount, which means the price after the manufacturer's discount is $80. Now, the retailer is offering an additional 20% discount on the discounted price of $80. So, the price after the retailer's discount is: Price after retailer's discount = $80 - (20/100) x $80 = $64 Therefore, the total discount available at that retailer is: Total discount = (Original price - Price after retailer's discount) / Original price x 100% Total discount = ($100 - $64) / $100 x 100% Total discount = 36% Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 36%.

After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the combined rate of painting of all three painters. Let's say the rate of Mr. Brown is B, the rate of Mr. Black is K, and the rate of Mr. Blue is L. Then, we have: B = 1/6 (since he can paint a house in 6 days) K = 1/8 (since he can paint a house in 8 days) L = 1/12 (since he can paint a house in 12 days) The combined rate of painting is the sum of their individual rates, which is: B + K + L = 1/6 + 1/8 + 1/12 = 6/24 + 3/24 + 2/24 = 11/24 This means that they can paint 11/24 of a house in one day. After 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation, so only Mr. Black and Mr. Blue are working. They work for 6 more days, which means they have worked for a total of 8 + 6 = 14 days. Let's say the fraction of the contract they have completed is f. Then, we have: 8 * (B + K + L) + 6 * (K + L) = f * 3 (the left-hand side is the amount of work they have done, which is equal to the fraction of the contract completed times the total amount of work) Simplifying this equation, we get: 8B + 8K + 8L + 6K + 6L = 3f 8B + 14K + 14L = 3f We know that B = 1/6, K = 1/8, and L = 1/12, so: 8/6 + 14/8 + 14/12 = 3f 4/3 + 7/4 + 7/6 = 3f Multiplying both sides by 12 (the least common multiple of 3, 4, and 6) gives: 16 + 21 + 14 = 36f 51 = 36f f = 17/24 This means that they have completed 17/24 of the contract in 14 days. To complete the remaining 7/24 of the contract, Mr. Blue needs: (7/24) / (1/12) = 21 days Therefore, the total number of days needed to complete the contract is 8 + 6 + 21 = 35 days.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Step 1: Let's assume the total number of students in the class is 'x'. Step 2: According to the question, 8% of the total students are interested in Football. So, the number of students interested in Football = 8% of x = 0.08x. Step 3: According to the question, 4/5 of the total students are interested in Cricket. So, the number of students interested in Cricket = 4/5 of x = 0.8x. Step 4: According to the question, 10% of the total students are interested in Basketball. So, the number of students interested in Basketball = 10% of x = 0.1x. Step 5: According to the question, 20 students are not interested in any games. So, the number of students interested in at least one game = Total number of students - Number of students not interested in any games = x - 20. Step 6: We know that the number of students interested in at least one game is the sum of the number of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball. So, we can write an equation: Number of students interested in Football + Number of students interested in Cricket + Number of students interested in Basketball = Number of students interested in at least one game 0.08x + 0.8x + 0.1x = x - 20 Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.98x = x - 20 x = 1000 Therefore, the total number of students in the class is 1000.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The given statement is: x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days. Let's assume that each man's efficiency is 1 unit of work per hour. Then, x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days because: x men x x hours/day x x days = x^3 units of work Now, we need to find how much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days. Using the same assumption of each man's efficiency being 1 unit of work per hour, y men working y hours per day can do y units of work in 1 day because: y men x y hours/day x 1 day = y^2 units of work Therefore, in y days, y men working y hours per day can do y^3 units of work. To express this in terms of x, we can use the given statement: x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days. We can rewrite this as: x men x x hours/day x 1 day = x units of work Therefore, 1 man working x hours per day can do x/x^2 = 1/x units of work in 1 day. Multiplying this by y men gives us: y men working x hours/day can do y/x units of work in 1 day. Multiplying this by y gives us: y men working x hours/day can do y^2/x units of work in y days. Finally, we need to adjust for the fact that y men are working y hours per day instead of x hours per day. Each man's efficiency is 1/x units of work per hour, so y men working y hours per day have an efficiency of (y/x) units of work per hour. Therefore, y men working y hours per day can do (y/x) times as much work as y men working x hours per day. Multiplying by this factor gives us: y men working y hours/day can do y^2/x * (y/x) = y^3/x^2 units of work in y days. Therefore, the answer is (B) y^3/x^2 units. The answer is B.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the original side length of the square piece of cloth is \"x\" feet. When 4 feet is trimmed from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become (x-4) by x. When this rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half, we get two right triangles with legs (x-4) and x. The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. We can use the formula for the area of a right triangle to set up an equation: (1/2) * (x-4) * x = 70 Simplifying this equation, we get: x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0 Solving for x using the quadratic formula, we get: x = (4 \u00b1 \u221a676)/2 x = (4 \u00b1 26)/2 x = 15 or x = -11 We can ignore the negative value of x, so the original side length of the square piece of cloth is 15 feet.

B invested for 10 months (since he joined after 2 months), so his investment is 10 x 60,000 = 600,000. C invested for (12 - x) months, so his investment is (12 - x) x 120,000 = 1,440,000 - 120,000x. Now, we can set up an equation to find C's share of the profit: (1,440,000 - 120,000x) / 375,000 = 150,000 / 375,000 Simplifying this equation, we get: 1,440,000 - 120,000x = 600,000 Multiplying both sides by -1 and simplifying, we get: 120,000x = 840,000 x = 7 Therefore, C joined the business after 7 months.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find out how many large cakes and small cakes can be made in 3 hours. Since each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour, and we have 3 hours, we can make 2 x 3 = 6 large cakes. Similarly, each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, we can make 35 x 3 = 105 small cakes per helper. Next, we need to find out how many helpers are needed to make the required number of cakes. We need 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes. Let's first focus on the large cakes. We know that each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour, so we can set up a proportion: 2 large cakes/hour = x helpers/3 hours Cross-multiplying, we get: 2x = 20 x = 10 Therefore, we need 10 helpers to make the required number of large cakes. Now let's focus on the small cakes.

Similarly, Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so he can make 1/9 of a toy in 1 hour. We also know that both of them made 35 toys in total, so: x + y = 35 We also know that they worked for almost similar number of hours, so we can assume that they worked for the same number of hours. Let's call this number of hours h. Then, we can set up an equation based on the work done by Alex and Jacob: (1/7)x + (1/9)y = h Multiplying both sides by 63 (the least common multiple of 7 and 9) gives: 9x + 7y = 63h Now we have two equations: x + y = 35 and 9x + 7y = 63h. We need to solve for y, so we can eliminate x by multiplying the first equation by 9 and subtracting it from the second equation: 9x + 7y = 63h 9(x + y) = 315 9x + 9y = 315 2y = 63h - 315 y = (63h - 315)/2 We know that y is a whole number, so 63h - 315 must be divisible by 2.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost price of one bag of ice. We know that the grocery makes a 20% profit on the selling price, which means that the selling price is 120% of the cost price. \n\nLet's assume that the cost price of one bag of ice is $x. \n\nSelling price = Cost price + Profit \n\n$1.25 = $x + 0.2($x) \n\n$1.25 = $x + $0.2x \n\n$1.25 = $1.2x \n\nx = $1.04 \n\nSo, the cost price of one bag of ice is $1.04. \n\nNow, let's calculate the total profit made by selling 500 bags of ice. \n\nTotal cost price of 500 bags of ice = 500 x $1.04 = $520 \n\nTotal selling price of 500 bags of ice = 500 x $1.25 = $625 \n\nTotal profit = Total selling price - Total cost price = $625 - $520 = $105 \n\nTherefore, the grocery makes a total profit of $105 by selling 500 bags of ice. \n\nSo, the correct answer is (E) 275.

We also know that the total income of the family is $9000, so x + y + z = $9000. Substituting y = $3000, we get x + $3000 + z = $9000, which simplifies to x + z = $6000. Since we have three variables and only two equations, we can't solve for x, y, and z.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet be l and b respectively. When folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm. This means that the length of each part is (48/2) - b = 24 - b. Therefore, the total length of the sheet is 2(24 - b) = 48 - 2b. Similarly, when folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm. This means that the length of each part is (66/2) - l = 33 - l. Therefore, the total length of the sheet is 2(33 - l) = 66 - 2l. We know that the length of the sheet is the same in both cases. Therefore, we can equate the two expressions: 48 - 2b = 66 - 2l Simplifying the equation, we get: l + b = 9 ...(1) Similarly, we can find the area of the sheet by equating the two expressions for the area of the sheet when folded along the two sets of sides: lb = 2(24 - b)(33 - l) Simplifying the equation, we get: lb = 1584 - 66l - 48b + 2lb 64l + 46b = 1584 lb - 2lb = 1584 - 64l - 46b lb = 792 - 32l - 23b Therefore, the area of the sheet is given by the equation lb = 792 - 32l - 23b. We also know from equation (1) that l = 9 - b. Substituting this value in the equation for the area, we get: b(9 - b) = 792 - 32(9 - b) - 23b Simplifying the equation, we get: b\u00b2 - 14b + 72 = 0 Solving for b using the quadratic formula, we get: b = (14 \u00b1 \u221a(14\u00b2 - 4(1)(72))) / 2 = 7 \u00b1 5\u221a2 Therefore, the area of the sheet is given by: lb = (9 - b)b = (9 - (7 + 5\u221a2))(7 + 5\u221a2) = (2 - 5\u221a2)(7 + 5\u221a2) = 14 - 25(2) = -36 Since the area cannot be negative, this answer is not possible.

Then, the distance between C and B is also x meters (since they are travelling along the same route). We can use the formula: distance = speed x time to find the distance travelled by Ram and Krishna in 10 seconds. For Ram, distance = 20 x 10 = 200 meters For Krishna, distance = 40 x 10 = 400 meters Therefore, the total distance between A and B is: distance between A and C + distance between C and B = x + x = 2x We know that Ram and Krishna cover a total distance of 200 + 400 = 600 meters in 10 seconds. Therefore, their combined speed is: speed = distance / time = 600 / 10 = 60 m/s We can use this speed to find the total distance between A and B: speed = distance / time 60 = 2x / t where t is the time taken for Ram and Krishna to travel from A to B. We can rearrange this equation to get: t = 2x / 60 t = x / 30 Now, we need to find the value of x. We know that Ram and Krishna cover a total distance of x + x = 2x in 10 seconds. Therefore, their combined speed is: speed = distance / time = 2x / 10 = x / 5 We can equate this to their combined speed of 60 m/s: x / 5 = 60 Solving for x, we get: x = 300 Therefore, the total distance between A and B is: 2x = 2 x 300 = 600 meters Therefore, the answer is (E) 600 meters.

So, the number of students studying math = (1/16)x The number of students studying bio = (1/10)x The number of students studying english = (1/8)x We need to find the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students. The maximum number of students will be when there is no overlap between the groups of students studying math, bio, and english. In other words, we need to add up the number of students studying each subject separately. So, the maximum number of students = (1/16)x + (1/10)x + (1/8)x = (13/80)x The minimum number of students will be when all the students studying math also study bio and english. In other words, we need to find the intersection of the groups of students studying math, bio, and english. The number of students studying all three subjects = (1/16)x (since this is the smallest group). So, the minimum number of students = (1/16)x The difference between the maximum and minimum number of students = (13/80)x - (1/16)x = (6/80)x = (3/40)x We know that x is a 4-digit number. The smallest 4-digit number is 1000 and the largest 4-digit number is 9999. So, the maximum value of (3/40)x occurs when x = 9999 and the minimum value of (3/40)x occurs when x = 1000. Therefore, the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students = (3/40)x_max - (3/40)x_min = (3/40)(9999 - 1000) = 887.7 (rounded to the nearest tenth) = 888.

His recorded property worth is the greatest positive even integer less than or equal to his actual property worth that is divisible by 100. To find this recorded property worth, we can start by finding the greatest even integer less than or equal to $1023.65. This is $1022. To find the greatest multiple of 100 that is less than or equal to $1022, we can divide $1022 by 100 and take the floor of the result (i.e., round down to the nearest integer). $1022 \u00f7 100 = 10.22, so the greatest multiple of 100 that is less than or equal to $1022 is $1000. Therefore, Robert's recorded property worth is $1000. The difference between his actual property worth and his recorded property worth is: $1023.65 - $1000 = $23.65.

Then, we can say that:\n\nNeha's position from the right end = n - 12 + 1 = n - 11\nRadha's position from the right end = 6\n\nWe are also given that when Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to the right by 2 places, there are 6 children between them.

Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 81 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) None",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the length and breadth of the rectangular parking space be L and B respectively. We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet. Therefore, the painted sides are L, B and L + B - 9. We are also given that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. Therefore, we can write an equation: L + B + L + B - 9 = 37 Simplifying this equation, we get: 2L + 2B = 46 L + B = 23 Now, we need to find the area of the parking space. Area = Length x Breadth = L x B We know that L + B = 23. We can use this information to eliminate one of the variables in the expression for the area. We can write: B = 23 - L Substituting this expression for B in the expression for the area, we get: Area = L x (23 - L) = 23L - L^2 To maximize the area, we need to find the value of L that will make the expression 23L - L^2 as large as possible. This occurs when L = 11.5. Therefore, the length of the parking space is 11.5 feet and the breadth is 11.5 feet (since L + B = 23). Therefore, the area of the parking space is: Area = Length x Breadth = 11.5 x 11.5 = 132.25 square feet. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is E.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, let's consider the case where x and y are both integers. In this case, we have: L(x,y) = x + y + (x+y) = 2x + 2y R(x,y) = 2x + 2y Therefore, L(x,y) = R(x,y) for all integer values of x and y. Now, let's consider the case where x and y are not integers. In this case, we have: L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x+y] R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] Since [x] \u2264 x and [y] \u2264 y, we have: L(x,y) \u2264 x + y + (x+y) = 2x + 2y R(x,y) \u2264 2x + 2y Therefore, if L(x,y) = R(x,y), then we must have: [x] + [y] + [x+y] = [2x] + [2y] Since [x] and [y] are integers, we can write x = [x] + {x} and y = [y] + {y}, where {x} and {y} are the fractional parts of x and y, respectively. Substituting these expressions into the equation above, we get: [x] + [y] + [x+y] = [2[x]+2{y}] + [2[y]+2{x}] = 2[x] + 2[y] + [2{x}+2{y}] Since [x] and [y] are integers, we have [2{x}+2{y}] \u2264 1. Therefore, we must have: [x] + [y] + [x+y] = 2[x] + 2[y] This simplifies to: [x+y] = [x] + [y] Now, let's consider the fractional parts of x and y. Since {x} and {y} are between 0 and 1, we have: {x+y} < 1 Therefore, we must have: [x+y] \u2264 [x] + [y] - 1 Combining this inequality with [x+y] = [x] + [y], we get: [x] + [y] \u2264 1 This means that either [x] = 0 and [y] = 0, or [x] = 0 and [y] = 1, or [x] = 1 and [y] = 0. In the first case, we have x < 1 and y < 1, which contradicts the assumption that x and y are positive real numbers. In the second case, we have x < 1 and y \u2265 1, which implies that [x+y] \u2265 2, contradicting the equation [x+y] = [x] + [y]. In the third case, we have x \u2265 1 and y < 1, which implies that [x+y] \u2265 2, contradicting the equation [x+y] = [x] + [y].

Answer Choices: (A) 40.8 (B) 41.6 (C) 42.2 (D) 43.5 (E) 44.8",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the weight of the heavy duty truck be x tons. According to the problem, the average weight of the 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. Therefore, the total weight of the 10 vehicles is 10 x 12.2 = 122 tons. After the new heavy duty truck is added, the average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons. Therefore, the new average weight is 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons. Now we have the total weight of the 11 vehicles, which is 11 x 14.8 = 162.8 tons.

How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the rate of hose A is a and the rate of hose B is b. We know that hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, so its rate is 1/8 of the pool per hour. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours, so it filled 2/8 or 1/4 of the pool. This means that 3/4 of the pool still needs to be filled. We also know that both hoses working together can fill the pool in 3 hours. So, in 1 hour, both hoses can fill 1/3 of the pool. Let's set up an equation using this information: \n\n2a + 3(a + b) = 3 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n5a + 3b = 3 \n\nWe also know that hose A can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, so its rate is 1/8 of the pool per hour. Using the formula rate = work/time, we can set up another equation: \n\na + b = 1/8 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nb = 1/8 - a \n\nSubstituting this value of b in the first equation, we get: \n\n5a + 3(1/8 - a) = 3 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n4a = 9/40 \n\na = 9/160 \n\nNow, we can find the rate of hose B: \n\nb = 1/8 - a = 1/8 - 9/160 = 7/160 \n\nFinally, we can find the time taken by hose B to fill the entire pool: \n\nb = 1/t \n\n7/160 = 1/t \n\nt = 160/7 \n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 22.86 hours, which is closest to option (B) 15.

Let's assume that the store had y yellow golf balls to begin with. Since the store sold 80% of its inventory, it sold 0.8 * 600 = 480 golf balls. Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, the number of white golf balls it had to begin with is equal to the number it sold, which is 480/2 = 240.

If 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, what percentage of all Daifu students are members of the swim team? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 30% (C) 40% (D) 50% (E) 60%",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that there are 100 students at Daifu university. 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team, which means there are 24 students who fit this description. Let's assume that there are x students who are members of the swim team. We know that 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, which means 80% of members of the swim team are members of the chess club. So, the number of students who are members of both the swim team and the chess club is 0.24x. We can write an equation: 0.24x = 0.8x - 24 Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.56x = 24 x = 42.86 (rounded to two decimal places) Therefore, the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team is 42.86%. Answer: None of the above (as none of the answer choices match 42.86%). The answer is approximately 43%.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step. Let's assume that the cost of one soda is x cents and the cost of one energy bar is y cents. From the given information, we can write two equations: Equation 1: x + 2y = 150 Equation 2: 2x + 3y = 300 We need to find the cost of 6 sodas and 7 energy bars. Let's multiply Equation 1 by 2 and subtract it from Equation 2 to eliminate x: 2x + 3y = 300 - (2x + 4y = 300) -3y = -150 y = 50 Substituting y = 50 in Equation 1, we get: x + 2(50) = 150 x = 50 Therefore, the cost of one soda is 50 cents and the cost of one energy bar is 50 cents. The cost of 6 sodas is 6x = 6(50) = 300 cents. The cost of 7 energy bars is 7y = 7(50) = 350 cents. Therefore, the total cost of 6 sodas and 7 energy bars is 300 + 350 = 650 cents.

We know that the cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. So, for the first quarter-mile, the cost will be $3.50. For each additional quarter mile, the cost will be $0.10. Let's assume that you travel x quarter-miles after the first quarter-mile. So, the total cost of the trip will be: $3.50 + $0.10x We also know that the total cost of the trip cannot exceed $8.50. So, we can set up the inequality: $3.50 + $0.10x <= $8.50 Solving for x, we get: x <= 50 Therefore, the maximum distance you can travel is: d = 0.25*(1 + 50) d = 12.75 miles Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 12.75 miles.

Let's simplify this equation: M - N = 990 - 396c We can substitute M = abc and N = cba into this equation: abc - cba = 990 - 396c Rearranging the digits, we get: 100a + 10b + c - (100c + 10b + a) = 990 - 396c Simplifying, we get: 99a - 99c = 990 - 396c 99(a - c) = 990 - 396c 99(a - c) = 99(10 - 4c) a - c = 10 - 4c Dividing both sides by 5, we get: (a - c)/5 = 2 - c/5 Since a > c, we know that (a - c)/5 is an integer between 1 and 9. Therefore, we can list out the possible values of (a - c)/5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 Solving for c in each case, we get: c = 3, 1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6, 4, 7 Therefore, there are 9 possible values of c. For each value of c, we can find the corresponding values of a and b using the equations: a - c = 2b a > c a, b, and c are digits between 0 and 9 that satisfy these equations. We can solve for a and b in terms of c: a = 2b + c b = (a - c)/2 Since a > c, we know that b is a positive integer. We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get: a = a - c + 2c a = 3c Therefore, for each value of c, we have a unique value of a and b: c = 3, a = 9, b = 3 c = 1, a = 3, b = 1 c = 4, a = 12, b = 4 (not valid since a is a two-digit number) c = 2, a = 6, b = 2 c = 5, a = 15, b = 5 (not valid since a is a two-digit number) c = 6, a = 18, b = 6 (not valid since a is a two-digit number) c = 4, a = 13, b = 4 (not valid since a is a two-digit number) c = 7, a = 21, b = 7 (not valid since a is a two-digit number) Therefore, there are only 3 values of M that are more than 300: 931, 613, and 931.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the original mixture contains x kg of sand and y kg of clay. We know that the total weight of the mixture is 10 kg. So, we can write: x + y = 10 We also know that the mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. So, we can write: x/(x + y) = 0.3 and y/(x + y) = 0.7 Now, we want to remove some of the mixture and replace it with pure sand so that the mixture contains equal quantities of sand and clay. Let's say we remove z kg of the mixture and replace it with z kg of pure sand. After this, the weight of the mixture will still be 10 kg. So, we can write: (x - 0.3z + z) + (y - 0.7z) = 10 Simplifying this equation, we get: x + y - 0.4z = 10 We also want the mixture to contain equal quantities of sand and clay. So, we can write: (x - 0.3z + z)/(10 - z) = 0.5 and (y - 0.7z)/(10 - z) = 0.5 Simplifying these equations, we get: x - 0.2z = 5 and y - 0.2z = 5 Now, we have three equations: x + y = 10 x - 0.2z = 5 y - 0.2z = 5 We can solve these equations to find the value of z. Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get: 0.2z = 5 Solving for z, we get: z = 25/2 = 12.5 Therefore, we need to remove 12.5/10 = 5/4 of the original mixture and replace it with 5/4 kg of pure sand. Simplifying, we get: 5/4 = 1.25 5/4 of 10 kg = 12.5 kg So, we need to remove 12.5 kg of the mixture and replace it with 1.25 kg of pure sand. The amount of mixture to be removed is 12.5 kg, which is equal to (B) 20/7 of the original mixture. Therefore, the answer is (B) 20/7.",

The side of the square paper is given as 20 cm, so the area of the paper is: A = 20^2 = 400 cm^2\n\nNext, we need to find the area of the two semi-circles. The formula for the area of a circle is A = \u03c0r^2, where r is the radius. Since the diameter of each semi-circle is the same as the side of the square paper, the radius is half of that, which is 10 cm. Therefore, the area of one semi-circle is: A = 1/2 * \u03c0 * 10^2 = 50\u03c0 cm^2. The area of two semi-circles is twice this amount, which is 100\u03c0 cm^2.\n\nWhen the two semi-circles are cut out, the remaining paper is in the shape of a square with two quarter circles removed. The area of each quarter circle is 1/4 of the area of a full circle with the same radius. Therefore, the area of two quarter circles is 1/2 of the area of a full circle with the same radius. The area of a full circle with radius 10 cm is: A = \u03c0 * 10^2 = 100\u03c0 cm^2.

Since there are two candidates, the winning candidate needs more than 50% of the votes to win. If the winning candidate won by 15% of the votes, then the winning candidate got 50% + 15% = 65% of the votes.

This means that: 2272 = kN + R 875 = mN + R where k and m are integers. We can subtract the second equation from the first to get: 1397 = (k-m)N Solving for N, we get: N = 1397/(k-m) Since N is a 3-digit number, k-m must be a factor of 1397.

According to the problem, their ages sum up to 100, so we can write: J + S + F = 100 We also know that when Joe is as old as his father, his sister will be twice as old as now. This means that the age difference between Joe and his sister will remain the same, so we can write: F - J = 2(S - J) Simplifying this equation: F - 2S + J = 0 Now we can use this equation to eliminate J from the first equation: J + S + F = 100 J = F - 2S + F = 2F - 2S Substituting J = 2F - 2S into the first equation: 2F - 2S + S + F = 100 Simplifying this equation: 3F - S = 100 We also know that when Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. This means that the age difference between Joe and his father will be the same as the age difference between his sister and his father, so we can write: F - J = 2(F - S) Simplifying this equation: J - S = F/2 Now we can use this equation to eliminate S from the third equation: 3F - S = 100 S = J - F/2 = 2F - 2S - F/2 = 3F/2 - 2S Substituting S = 3F/2 - 2S into the third equation: J + S + F = 100 J + (3F/2 - 2S) + F = 100 2J + 2F - 4S = 100 Now we can substitute S = (2F - J)/2 into this equation: 2J + 2F - 4[(2F - J)/2] = 100 Simplifying this equation: 2J + 2F - 4F + 4J = 100 6J - 2F = 100 3J - F = 50 Now we have two equations: 3F - S = 100 3J - F = 50 We can solve for F by adding these two equations: 3J - S = 150 Solving for S using the equation S = (2F - J)/2: S = (2F - J)/2 = (2F - (3F - 150))/2 = (150 + F)/2 Now we can substitute this expression for S into the equation 3F - S = 100: 3F - (150 + F)/2 = 100 Simplifying this equation: 6F - 150 - F = 200 5F = 350 F = 70 Therefore, the age of Joe's father is 70 years old.

Let the length and breadth of the plot be L and B respectively. Then, we have: 2(L + B) = 340 L + B = 170 We also know that we need to garden a 1-metre broad boundary around the plot. This means that the length and breadth of the plot after gardening will be (L + 2) and (B + 2) respectively. The area of the boundary will be: Area of boundary = (L + 2)(B + 2) - LB = 2L + 2B + 4 The cost of gardening the boundary at the rate of 10 per square metre will be: Cost of gardening = 10 x Area of boundary = 10(2L + 2B + 4) = 20L + 20B + 40 Now, we need to find the values of L and B.

Using the values of tan(45\u00b0) and tan(60\u00b0), we get: x/h = 1 or h = x and x/h = \u221a3 or h = x/\u221a3. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x/\u221a3 - x = h - h/\u221a3 Simplifying this equation, we get: x(\u221a3 - 1) = h(\u221a3 - 1) Now, we need to find the time it takes for the car to cover the distance x. We know that the car is moving at a uniform speed, so we can use the formula: speed = distance/time. Let the speed of the car be v. Then, we can write: v = x/t where t is the time taken to cover the distance x. We also know that it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. This means that the car covers a distance x in 10 minutes and a distance 2x in t + 10 minutes (when the angle of elevation changes from 60\u00b0 to 90\u00b0). Using the values of tan(60\u00b0) and tan(90\u00b0), we get: h/x = \u221a3 or h = \u221a3x and h/2x = \u221e or h = \u221e.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's call the number of consecutive integers \"k\", and let's call the first (or least) integer \"x\". We know that the sum of the k consecutive integers is 51, so we can write an equation: x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1) = 51 We also know that the least integer is -50, so we can substitute that in for x: -50 + (-50+1) + (-50+2) + ... + (-50+k-1) = 51 Simplifying this equation, we get: -50k + (1+2+...+k) = 51 We can use the formula for the sum of the first k positive integers: 1+2+...+k = k(k+1)/2 Substituting this into the equation, we get: -50k + k(k+1)/2 = 51 Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get: -100k + k(k+1) = 102 Simplifying, we get: k^2 - 99k + 102 = 0 We can solve for k using the quadratic formula: k = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a In this case, a = 1, b = -99, and c = 102. Plugging these values in, we get: k = (-(-99) \u00b1 sqrt((-99)^2 - 4(1)(102))) / 2(1) k = (99 \u00b1 sqrt(9801 - 408)) / 2 k = (99 \u00b1 sqrt(9393)) / 2 We can see that the only integer solution for k is 92, since (99 + sqrt(9393))/2 is greater than 92.

To reach the first step, there is only one way (take one step). To reach the second step, there are two ways (take one step twice or take two steps at once). To reach the third step, there are three ways (take one step, then one step, then two steps; take one step, then two steps, then one step; take two steps, then one step, then one step). In general, to reach the nth step, the boy can either take one step from the (n-1)th step or take two steps from the (n-2)th step. Therefore, the number of ways to reach the nth step is equal to the sum of the number of ways to reach the (n-1)th step and the (n-2)th step.

After covering a quarter of the distance, the remaining distance is: 1000 - (1/4) * 1000 = 750 miles. Let's call the time taken to cover the remaining distance \"t\". We can set up the equation: 750 = 75t Solving for t, we get: t = 10 hours. Therefore, the total journey duration is: 10 + 10 = 20 hours. However, we need to subtract the time taken to slow down the train from 100 mph to 75 mph. This time is the distance covered at 25 mph (the difference between the two speeds) divided by the slower speed of 75 mph. The distance covered at 25 mph is: distance = speed * time = 25 * (1/4) * 1000 = 625 miles. The time taken to cover this distance at 75 mph is: time = distance / speed = 625 / 75 = 8.33 hours.

We know that there are 250 files in total, and that some of them are infected only by a virus, some are infected only by a worm, and some are infected by both.

Step 3: Calculate the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z. - The total amount of zinc in alloy Z is 16 + 28 = 44 grams. - The total amount of copper in alloy Z is 24 + 36 = 60 grams. - So, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 44:60 or 22:30. - Simplifying this ratio, we get 11:15. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 11:15. The answer is D.",

If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step. \n\nLet's assume that the wholesale cost of the appliance is $100. \n\nAccording to the problem, the original retail price of the appliance is 60% more than its wholesale cost. \n\n60% of $100 is $60, so the original retail price is $100 + $60 = $160. \n\nNow, the appliance is sold for 20% less than the original retail price. \n\n20% of $160 is $32, so the selling price is $160 - $32 = $128. \n\nWe need to find the percentage by which the appliance was sold for more than its wholesale cost. \n\nThe markup percentage from wholesale cost to original retail price is: \n\nMarkup percentage = (Original retail price - Wholesale cost) / Wholesale cost x 100% \n\nMarkup percentage = ($160 - $100) / $100 x 100% = 60% \n\nThe discount percentage from original retail price to selling price is: \n\nDiscount percentage = (Original retail price - Selling price) / Original retail price x 100% \n\nDiscount percentage = ($160 - $128) / $160 x 100% = 20% \n\nTherefore, the percentage by which the appliance was sold for more than its wholesale cost is: \n\nPercentage = Markup percentage x (100% - Discount percentage) \n\nPercentage = 60% x (100% - 20%) = 48% \n\nSo, the correct answer is (E) 42%.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the breadth of the rectangular piece is x meters. Then, the length of the rectangular piece is (4x + 1) meters. We know that the area of the rectangular piece is 150 sq m. Therefore, we can write: x(4x + 1) = 150 Simplifying the equation, we get: 4x^2 + x - 150 = 0 We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring: (4x - 15)(x + 10) = 0 The solutions are: x = 15/4 or x = -10 Since the breadth cannot be negative, we take x = 15/4. Therefore, the length of the rectangular piece is: 4x + 1 = 4(15/4) + 1 = 16 meters The perimeter of the rectangular piece is: 2(length + breadth) = 2(16 + 15/4) = 62 meters Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 62 m.",

Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's say the speed of the elevator is \"x\" steps/minute. \n\nIf you walk 20 steps and stop, you cover a distance of 20 steps in 10 minutes. This means your speed is 20/10 = 2 steps/minute. \n\nWhen you stop, the elevator continues to move down. Let's say it takes \"t\" minutes for the elevator to cover the same distance of 20 steps. \n\nSo, the time taken for you and the elevator to cover the same distance of 20 steps is: \n\n10 minutes + t minutes \n\nNow, let's consider the second scenario. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you cover a distance of 10 steps in 20 minutes. This means your speed is 10/20 = 0.5 steps/minute. \n\nAgain, when you stop, the elevator continues to move down. Let's say it takes \"s\" minutes for the elevator to cover the same distance of 10 steps. \n\nSo, the time taken for you and the elevator to cover the same distance of 10 steps is: \n\n20 minutes + s minutes \n\nSince the elevator is moving at a constant speed, we can set up the following equation: \n\n20/x - t = 20/(2x) \n\nThis equation says that the time taken by the elevator to cover 20 steps (which is 20/x) minus the time you took to cover the same distance (which is t) is equal to the time taken by the elevator to cover 20 steps when you covered 20 steps as well (which is 20/(2x)). \n\nSimilarly, we can set up another equation: \n\n10/x - s = 10/(0.5x) \n\nThis equation says that the time taken by the elevator to cover 10 steps (which is 10/x) minus the time you took to cover the same distance (which is s) is equal to the time taken by the elevator to cover 10 steps when you covered 10 steps as well (which is 10/(0.5x)). \n\nSimplifying both equations, we get: \n\n20x - 2xt = 40 \n\n10x - 0.5xs = 20 \n\nWe can solve for \"x\" by eliminating one variable. Let's multiply the second equation by 4: \n\n40x - 2xs = 80 \n\nNow we can add the two equations: \n\n60x = 120 \n\nx = 2 \n\nTherefore, the speed of the elevator is 2 steps/minute. \n\nThe answer is (B) 2 step/minute.",

            "Question": "Q: A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the volume of the coin made of aluminum and silver. The volume of the coin can be calculated as the volume of a cylinder with height 2 mm and radius 7.5 mm (half of the diameter). Volume of the coin = \u03c0 x (7.5 mm)^2 x 2 mm = 352.5 mm^3 Let's assume the volume of aluminum in the coin is x mm^3. Since the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, the volume of silver in the coin is also x mm^3. Let's assume the density of aluminum is y g/cm^3. Then, the weight of aluminum in the coin is: weight of aluminum = volume of aluminum x density of aluminum = (x/1000) cm^3 x y g/cm^3 = xy/1000 g Similarly, the weight of silver in the coin is: weight of silver = volume of silver x density of silver = (x/1000) cm^3 x 2y g/cm^3 = 2xy/1000 g The total weight of the coin is given as 30 grams. So, we can set up the equation: weight of aluminum + weight of silver = 30 grams xy/1000 + 2xy/1000 = 30 grams 3xy/1000 = 30 grams xy = 10000 mm^3 Now, we need to find the weight of a pure aluminum coin measuring 1 x 30 mm. The volume of this coin can be calculated as the volume of a cylinder with height 1 mm and radius 15 mm. Volume of the pure aluminum coin = \u03c0 x (15 mm)^2 x 1 mm = 225\u03c0 mm^3 Let's assume the density of pure aluminum is z g/cm^3. Then, the weight of the pure aluminum coin is: weight of pure aluminum coin = volume of pure aluminum x density of pure aluminum = (225\u03c0/1000) cm^3 x z g/cm^3 = 0.225\u03c0z grams We know that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum. So, we can set up the equation: 2y = z Solving for z, we get: z = 2y Substituting this value in the equation for weight of pure aluminum coin, we get: weight of pure aluminum coin = 0.225\u03c0z = 0.225\u03c0(2y) = 0.45\u03c0y grams Substituting the value of xy from the earlier equation, we get: xy = 10000 mm^3 = (352.5 mm^3) x (x/352.5) x (10000/352.5) = x^2 x 84.507 So, x^2 = 10000/84.507 = 118.34 mm^3 Taking the square root, we get: x = 10.87 mm^3 Now, we can substitute the value of y in terms of x in the equation for weight of pure aluminum coin: weight of pure aluminum coin = 0.45\u03c0y = 0.45\u03c0(x/2) = 0.225\u03c0x = 0.225\u03c0(10.87) = 7.67 grams Therefore, the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum is 7.67 grams. So, the answer is (E) 7.67 grams. The answer is E.",
