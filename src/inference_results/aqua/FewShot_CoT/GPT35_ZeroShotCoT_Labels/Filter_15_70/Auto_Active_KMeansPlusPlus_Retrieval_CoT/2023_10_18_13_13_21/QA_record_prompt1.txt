Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Step 1: Determine the minimum daily requirement of each vitamin. Let's assume that the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is x grams and the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A is y grams. Step 2: Write an equation for the amount of each vitamin in one gram of the health food. One gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E, which is 0.09x grams, and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, which is 0.08y grams. Step 3: Write an equation for the total amount of each vitamin in the required daily intake. To meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to consume at least x/0.09 grams of the health food for vitamin E and y/0.08 grams of the health food for vitamin A. Step 4: Write an equation for the total amount of the health food needed. Since we need to consume the same amount of health food for both vitamins, we can set the two equations equal to each other: x/0.09 = y/0.08 Step 5: Solve for x and y. x = (0.09/0.08)y x = 1.125y Step 6: Substitute x into one of the equations from Step 3 and solve for y. x/0.09 = y/0.08 (1.125y)/0.09 = y/0.08 12.5y = 9y y = 0.72 grams Step 7: Substitute y into the equation for x from Step 5 and solve for x. x = 1.125y x = 1.125(0.72) x = 0.81 grams Step 8: Determine the total amount of the health food needed. Since we need to consume the same amount of health food for both vitamins, we can use either x or y to determine the total amount: Total amount = x/0.09 = 0.81/0.09 = 9 grams Therefore, we need to eat 9 grams of the health food daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.

Let's assume that the entire yacht is represented by the number 1. Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours, so he can clean 1/12 of the yacht in 1 hour. Therefore, he can clean 2/3 of the yacht in (2/3) / (1/12) = 8 hours. This means that Jill has to clean the remaining 1/3 of the yacht. We know that Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. This means that Jill can clean 5% of 1/12 of the yacht in 1 hour, or 1/240 of the yacht in 1 hour. To clean 1/3 of the yacht, Jill will need to work for (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours. Therefore, the answer is (D) 50. The answer is D.",

The number of students excluding the highest and lowest scorers is z - 2, so the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is: T/(z - 2) = (yz - 2x)/(z - 2). Therefore, the answer is (C) (zx - y)/(z - 2). The answer is C.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that there are n members in the club. We know that the youngest member is 7 years old, so the ages of all the members can be represented as: 7, 7 + 3, 7 + 6, 7 + 9, ..., 7 + 3(n - 1) We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the sum of all the ages: Sum = (n/2) * [2a + (n - 1)d] where a is the first term (7), d is the common difference (3), and n is the number of terms (which we need to find). We know that the sum of all the ages is 250, so we can set up the equation: 250 = (n/2) * [2(7) + (n - 1)(3)] Simplifying, we get: 250 = (n/2) * (3n + 19) Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: 500 = n(3n + 19) Rearranging, we get: 3n^2 + 19n - 500 = 0 We can solve for n using the quadratic formula: n = (-19 \u00b1 sqrt(19^2 - 4(3)(-500))) / (2(3)) n = (-19 \u00b1 sqrt(9616)) / 6 n = (-19 \u00b1 98) / 6 We can ignore the negative solution, so: n = 13 or n = 20 We know that the youngest member is 7 years old, so there must be at least 7/0.25 = 28 members (since the common difference is 3 months, or 0.25 years).

Therefore, the amount of food left in the bowl after four feeding sessions can be found by multiplying the terms of the sequence: 1/3 x 2/9 x 4/27 x 8/81 = 64/19683. Step 3: Determine the percentage of the original food that is left in the bowl. To do this, we need to divide the amount of food left in the bowl by the original amount of food and then multiply by 100%. Since the dog ate exactly once an hour, we can assume that the original amount of food was consumed in four hours. Therefore, the percentage of the original food that is left in the bowl is: (64/19683) / 1 x 100% = 0.325 x 100% = 32.5% Approximately, 32.5% of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day. Therefore, the answer is (C) 30%.",

This can be done using the combination formula: C(11,3) = 165. \n\nNext, we need to find the combinations of 3 candy bars that have a total cost of more than $4. We can do this by considering the different cases: \n\nCase 1: All three candy bars cost $2 each. There are C(4,3) = 4 ways to select 3 candy bars that all cost $2 each. \n\nCase 2: Two candy bars cost $2 each and one candy bar costs $1. There are C(4,2) x C(4,1) = 24 ways to select 2 candy bars that cost $2 each and 1 candy bar that costs $1. \n\nCase 3: One candy bar costs $2, one candy bar costs $1, and one candy bar costs 50 cents. There are C(4,1) x C(3,1) x C(3,1) = 36 ways to select 1 candy bar that costs $2, 1 candy bar that costs $1, and 1 candy bar that costs 50 cents. \n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to select 3 candy bars with a total cost of more than $4 is 4 + 24 + 36 = 64. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 66.",

If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth? Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the original square piece of cloth had a side length of x feet. When 4 feet is trimmed from one edge, the resulting rectangular piece has dimensions of (x-4) by x. When this rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half, we get two right triangles with legs of (x-4) and x. The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. We can use the formula for the area of a triangle to set up an equation: (1/2) * (x-4) * x = 70 Simplifying this equation, we get: x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0 We can solve for x using the quadratic formula: x = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(4^2 - 4(1)(-140))] / (2*1) x = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(596)] / 2 x = 2 \u00b1 sqrt(149) We can discard the negative solution since x represents a length. Therefore, x = 2 + sqrt(149) feet. The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4x feet. Substituting x, we get: 4x = 4(2 + sqrt(149)) = 8 + 4sqrt(149) feet. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is (approximately) 8 + 4sqrt(149) feet.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Step 1: Find the total number of large cakes needed. Since 20 large cakes are needed, we can assume that each large cake is equivalent to 10 small cakes (since 2 large cakes = 20 small cakes). Therefore, the total number of small cakes needed is 20 x 10 + 700 = 900. \n\nStep 2: Find the number of small cakes that can be made by one helper in 3 hours. Since each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour, one helper can make 35 x 3 = 105 small cakes in 3 hours. \n\nStep 3: Find the number of large cakes that can be made by one helper in 3 hours.

We can make one bouquet with all 28 tulips. Now, let's consider the case where we have 14 red tulips and 28 white tulips. We can make two bouquets with each bouquet having 14 white tulips and 7 red tulips. Similarly, we can make two bouquets with 14 red tulips and 42 white tulips, three bouquets with 14 red tulips and 56 white tulips, and so on.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can start by using the formula: Profit = Selling Price x Profit Margin. We know that the profit margin is 25% of the selling price, or 0.25. We also know that the selling price is $100. So, we can write: $3,000 = $100 x 0.25 x Number of bags sold. Solving for the number of bags sold, we get: Number of bags sold = $3,000 / ($100 x 0.25) = 12 x 4 = 48. Therefore, the grocer sold 48 bags of flour. However, this answer is not one of the answer choices. We made a mistake in our calculation. We should have divided $3,000 by 0.25 instead of multiplying by 0.25.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. First, we need to find the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade in one revolution. The distance traveled in one revolution is equal to the circumference of the circle with a radius of 10 centimeters. The circumference of a circle is given by the formula 2\u03c0r, where r is the radius. So, the distance traveled in one revolution is 2\u03c0(10) = 20\u03c0 centimeters. Next, we need to find the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade in 300 revolutions per minute. To do this, we can multiply the distance traveled in one revolution by the number of revolutions per minute and the time in minutes. We need to convert 30 seconds to minutes by dividing by 60: 300 revolutions/minute x 20\u03c0 centimeters/revolution x 30/60 minutes = 3000\u03c0 centimeters Therefore, the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade after 30 seconds is 3000\u03c0 centimeters.

Step 3: We know that the total number of people who preferred red cars is 0.6x (as 60% of the people who took the survey were women and we don't know their preference). Therefore, we can write the following equation: 0.6x = 0.75y + 10 Step 4: We need to find the value of \"x\". To do that, we need to find the value of \"y\". We can rearrange the equation from Step 3 to get: y = (0.6x - 10)/0.75 y = 0.8x - 13.33 Step 5: We know that the total number of men who preferred green cars is 10 (as given in the question). Therefore, we can write the following equation: 0.75y + 10 + 0.4x = x 0.75(0.8x - 13.33) + 10 + 0.4x = x 0.6x - 4.995 + 10 + 0.4x = x 1x = 14.995 x \u2248 15 Therefore, the answer is (A) 100, because 15 is 1/6th of 100 (as 60% of the people who took the survey were women).

Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the total production cost for one year. Since the company produces 420 units every month, the total production cost for one month is: 420 x $110 = $46,200. Therefore, the total production cost for one year is: $46,200 x 12 = $554,400. \n\nNext, we need to find the minimum revenue required to make a profit of $626,400. The revenue is the selling price per component multiplied by the number of components sold. Let the minimum selling price per component be x. Then, the revenue for one month is: 420 x x. Therefore, the revenue for one year is: 420 x x x 12 = 5040x. \n\nNow, we can set up an equation to find the minimum selling price per component: \n\n5040x - $554,400 = $626,400 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n5040x = $1,180,800 \n\nDividing both sides by 5040, we get: \n\nx = $234 \n\nTherefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234. \n\nThe answer is None of the above.",

We can set up an equation based on this: 2(24 - w) + 2l = 48 Simplifying this equation, we get: l + w = 24 When folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm. This means that the length of each part is (66/2) - w = 33 - w. Similarly, the width of each part is (66/2) - l = 33 - l.

If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Step 1: Find the number of tagged deer in the 500 deer sample. We know that 20 deer in the 500 deer sample had tags from the previous year. If we assume that the percentage of tagged deer in the sample is representative of the percentage of tagged deer in the entire population, then we can write the equation: 20/x = y/500 where x is the total deer population and y is the total number of tagged deer. Solving for y, we get: y = 20x/500 = x/25. Therefore, the number of tagged deer in the 500 deer sample is y = x/25. Step 2: Find the percentage of tagged deer in the 500 deer sample. The percentage of tagged deer in the 500 deer sample is: (y/500) x 100% = (x/25 x 1/500) x 100% = x/125%. Step 3: Find the percentage of tagged deer in the entire population. We know that the percentage of tagged deer in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percentage of tagged deer in the entire population. Therefore, the percentage of tagged deer in the entire population is also x/125%. Step 4: Find the number of tagged deer in the entire population. We know that 300 deer were tagged in 2001. Therefore, the total number of tagged deer in the entire population is 300 + (x/125%) = 300 + (0.01x). Step 5: Set up an equation to solve for x. We know that the total number of deer caught in 2002 is 500. Therefore, the total deer population is the sum of the number of deer caught in 2001 and 2002, which is 300 + 500 = 800. We can write the equation: (300 + 0.01x)/800 x 100% = x/125% Solving for x, we get: x = 6000 Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 6000. Answer: (D) 6000. The answer is D.",

If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 50% (D) 65% (E) 75%",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the current population of Boomtown is 100. According to the projection, the population will increase by 10% per year for the next two years. So, after one year, the population will be 100 + (10% of 100) = 110. After two years, the population will be 110 + (10% of 110) = 121. Now, we know that the population two years from now will be double the population one year ago. So, the population two years from now will be 2 x 100 = 200. Therefore, the population has increased by 200 - 110 = 90 in the last year. To find the percent population increase, we divide the increase (90) by the original population (100) and multiply by 100. (90/100) x 100 = 90%. Therefore, the answer is (E) 75%. The answer is E.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Step 1: Let's use a variable to represent the amount of falafel in two baguettes. Let's call this variable \"x\". Step 2: According to the problem, six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls. This can be written as: 6p = 2r Step 3: Also according to the problem, three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes. This can be written as: 3r = 5b Step 4: We want to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes. We can start by using the equations we have to eliminate the variable \"r\". Multiplying both sides of the equation 6p = 2r by 3, we get: 18p = 6r. We can substitute 5b for 3r in this equation to get: 18p = 6(5b) 18p = 30b Dividing both sides by 30, we get: (18/30)p = (3/5)p = b Step 5: We now know that three-fifths of a pita bread contains the same amount of falafel as one baguette. We want to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes, which is twice the amount of falafel in one baguette. Therefore, we need to multiply (3/5)p by 2. (3/5)p x 2 = (6/5)p = 1.2p Therefore, 1.2 pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes. To simplify this fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by 5: 1.2 pita breads = 6/5 pita breads. Therefore, the answer is (A) 12/25.",

We want to find the minimum number of DVDs rented to make the membership worth it. So, we can set up an inequality: 7 + 2x < 4x Solving for x, we get: 7 < 2x x > 3.5 Since we can't rent a fraction of a DVD, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

However, we need to subtract the number of ways to select 2 balls from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is selected. There is only one way to select the ball with number 3, and then we need to select 1 more ball from the remaining n-1 balls. So, the number of ways to select 2 balls from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is selected is (n-1)C1 = n-1. Therefore, the number of ways to select 2 balls from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected is: nC2 - (n-1) = 45. Simplifying this equation, we get: n(n-1)/2 - (n-1) = 45. Multiplying both sides by 2 and simplifying, we get: n^2 - n - 90 = 0. Factoring this quadratic equation, we get: (n-10)(n+9) = 0.

What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount? Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's break down the problem. The terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can get a 4% discount if he pays within 30 days, or he can pay the full amount within n days without any discount. We want to find the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount. Let's assume that the merchant borrows the full amount of $20,000 and pays it back after 30 days. If he takes the discount, he will only have to pay 96% of the full amount, which is $20,000 * 0.96 = $19,200. Therefore, the interest he can afford to pay is $19,200 - $20,000 = -$800. This means that he can borrow up to $20,000 and pay back $19,200 after 30 days without incurring any interest charges. The interest rate he can afford to pay is: Interest rate = (Interest / Principal) * (365 / Days) * 100% Interest rate = (-$800 / $20,000) * (365 / 30) * 100% Interest rate = -0.04 * 12.17 * 100% Interest rate = -4.868% The highest simple interest rate he can afford to borrow money at is 4.868%. However, this is a negative interest rate, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the correct answer is None of these. The answer is E.",

Now, he wants to increase the price back to the original price of $100. The percentage increase required can be calculated as follows: Percentage increase = [(New value - Old value) / Old value] x 100% Percentage increase = [(100 - 80) / 80] x 100% Percentage increase = (20 / 80) x 100% Percentage increase = 25% Therefore, the shopkeeper must increase the price by 25% to sell the item at the original price.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. Let's assume that the time taken by Mr. Sam to travel one way by train is 't' hours. Therefore, the total time taken by him to go by train to the city and return by car would be 17 hours, which means that the time taken by him to return by car would be (17 - t) hours. Now, we are given that he loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. This means that the total time taken by him to go and return by train would be (2t + 4) hours. We can now set up an equation based on the given information: \n\n2t + 4 = 17 - t \n\nSolving for 't', we get: \n\n3t = 13 \n\nt = 4.33 \n\nTherefore, the time taken by Mr. Sam to travel one way by train is approximately 4.33 hours. \n\nNow, we need to find out how long he would have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways. The time taken by him to travel one way by car would be the same as the time taken by him to return by car, which is (17 - t) hours. Therefore, the total time taken by him to go and return by car would be: \n\n2 x (17 - t) = 2 x (17 - 4.33) = 25.34 \n\nTherefore, he would have taken approximately 25.34 hours if he had traveled by car in both ways. \n\nHowever, none of the answer choices provided in the question match this value.

In that time, the first car would have travelled a distance of 12t miles, and the second car would have travelled a distance of 13t miles. Since they are travelling towards each other, the total distance between them is decreasing at a rate of (12 + 13) = 25 mph. We are given that the total distance between them is 50 miles.

We want this to be 60% of the total amount of liquid, which is (1 + x) gallons. So, we can write: (0.4 + x)/(1 + x) = 0.6 Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x 0.4 - 0.6 = 0.6x - x -0.2 = -0.4x x = 0.5 Therefore, we need to add 0.5 gallons of orange juice to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's call the 5-digit number \"abcde\". According to the problem, if we add a 1 after it, we get the number \"abcde1\", which is three times as large as the number we get if we add a 1 before it, which is \"1abcde\". We can write this as an equation: 3(1abcde) = abcde1 We can simplify this equation by expanding the numbers: 300000 + 3(abcd) = 100000a + 10000b + 1000c + 100d + 10e + 1 We can simplify this equation further by noticing that the left-hand side is divisible by 3, so the right-hand side must also be divisible by 3. Therefore, we can add up the digits on the right-hand side and check if the sum is divisible by 3: 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + a + b + c + d + e = 1 + (a + b + c + d + e) Since 1 + (a + b + c + d + e) is not divisible by 3, we know that a + b + c + d + e must be divisible by 3. We can use this fact to narrow down the possible values of a. If we try a = 1, then a + b + c + d + e = 3(abcd) + 1, which is not divisible by 3. If we try a = 2, then a + b + c + d + e = 3(abcd) + 2, which is not divisible by 3. If we try a = 3, then a + b + c + d + e = 3(abcd) + 3 = 3(abcd + 1), which is divisible by 3. Therefore, a = 3. We can substitute this value of a into the equation above and simplify: 30000 + 3(bcd) = 30000 + 10000b + 1000c + 100d + 10e + 1 3(bcd) = 10000b + 1000c + 100d + 10e + 1 We can repeat the same process to narrow down the possible values of b. If we try b = 0, then 3(bcd) = 1000c + 100d + 10e + 1, which is not possible since the left-hand side is divisible by 3 but the right-hand side is not. If we try b = 1, then 3(bcd) = 10000 + 1000c + 100d + 10e + 1 = 10001 + 1000(c + d + e), which is not possible since the left-hand side is divisible by 3 but the right-hand side is not. If we try b = 2, then 3(bcd) = 20000 + 1000c + 100d + 10e + 1 = 20001 + 1000(c + d + e), which is not possible since the left-hand side is divisible by 3 but the right-hand side is not. If we try b = 4, then 3(bcd) = 40000 + 1000c + 100d + 10e + 1 = 40001 + 1000(c + d + e), which is not possible since the left-hand side is divisible by 3 but the right-hand side is not. If we try b = 5, then 3(bcd) = 50000 + 1000c + 100d + 10e + 1 = 50001 + 1000(c + d + e), which is not possible since the left-hand side is divisible by 3 but the right-hand side is not.

We are given that: Group 1 (hardcover) = 30 Group 2 (fiction) = 20 Total = 45 We can substitute these values into the formula and solve for \"Both\": 45 = 30 + 20 - Both + Neither Simplifying, we get: 35 = Both + Neither We want to find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, which means we want to find the maximum value of \"Both\". To do this, we need to minimize the value of \"Neither\". The minimum value of \"Neither\" is 0 (if all the books are either hardcover or fiction).

We can use the formula: distance = (amount - initial charge) / rate For the additional quarter-mile rate of 10 cents, the rate is 1/4 mile / $0.10 = 2.5 miles/dollar. So, for $5.00, the distance we can travel is: distance = ($5.00 - $3.50) / (2.5 miles/dollar) = 2 miles Now, we need to add this distance to the distance we can travel for the remaining $3.50. For the remaining $3.50, the distance we can travel is: distance = $3.50 / (2.5 miles/dollar) = 1.4 miles Therefore, the total distance we can travel is: 2 miles + 1.4 miles = 3.4 miles. However, we need to convert this to quarter-miles, which is the unit used by the cab company. 3.4 miles = 13.6 quarter-miles.

What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 81 (C) 90 (D) 99 (E) 110",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Step 1: Find the minimum number of students who attended the prom night. 45% of 200 = 90 students. This means that at least 90 students attended the prom night. Step 2: Find the minimum number of students who took part in the debating session. 35% of 200 = 70 students. This means that at least 70 students took part in the debating session. Step 3: Find the maximum number of students who could have attended either the prom night or the debating session or both. This is the sum of the minimum number of students who attended the prom night and the minimum number of students who took part in the debating session, minus the total number of students (200). 90 + 70 - 200 = -40. This means that there are -40 students who attended either the prom night or the debating session or both. However, we know that the number of students who attended either event cannot be negative. Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is equal to the number of students who did not attend either event, which is equal to the total number of students (200) minus the minimum number of students who attended either event. 200 - (90 + 70) = 40.

This amount allows them to influence 30 senators. Let's assume that Hoopsmot can influence x senators. Then, Smolapon can influence (30 - x) senators. The amount of influence each person has is directly proportional to the amount of money they contribute. So, we can set up the following proportion: Hoopsmot's influence / Smolapon's influence = Hoopsmot's contribution / Smolapon's contribution x / (30 - x) = 16,000 / 4,000 x / (30 - x) = 4 We can solve for x by cross-multiplying: 4x = 120 - 4x 8x = 120 x = 15 So, Hoopsmot can influence 15 senators, and Smolapon can influence (30 - 15) = 15 senators.

What is the probability of the man catching the first train? Answer Choices: (A) 0.9 (B) 0.8 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.65 (E) 1.5",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The first train that comes could be either the main line or the harbor line. \n\nThe main line starts at 5:00 AM and has a frequency of 10 minutes, which means it will arrive at 5:00 AM, 5:10 AM, 5:20 AM, and so on. \n\nThe harbor line starts at 5:02 AM and has a frequency of 10 minutes, which means it will arrive at 5:02 AM, 5:12 AM, 5:22 AM, and so on. \n\nTo calculate the probability of the man catching the first train, we need to find the time intervals during which the first train will arrive. \n\nIf the man arrives at the station between 5:00 AM and 5:02 AM, he will catch the first train, which is the main line. \n\nIf the man arrives at the station between 5:02 AM and 5:10 AM, he will catch the first train, which is the harbor line. \n\nIf the man arrives at the station between 5:10 AM and 5:20 AM, he will catch the first train, which is the main line. \n\nIf the man arrives at the station between 5:20 AM and 5:22 AM, he will catch the first train, which is the harbor line. \n\nThis pattern will repeat every 20 minutes (the LCM of 10 and 12). \n\nTherefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is the sum of the time intervals during which he will catch the first train, divided by the total time interval (from 5:00 AM to 5:30 AM). \n\nThe time intervals during which the man will catch the first train are: \n\n- 5:00 AM to 5:02 AM (main line)\n- 5:02 AM to 5:10 AM (harbor line)\n- 5:10 AM to 5:20 AM (main line)\n- 5:20 AM to 5:22 AM (harbor line)\n\nAdding up these time intervals, we get: \n\n2 + 8 + 10 + 2 = 22 minutes \n\nThe total time interval is 30 minutes. \n\nTherefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is: \n\n22/30 = 0.733 \n\nRounding to two decimal places, the answer is (D) 0.65. \n\nNote: The answer choices given are not accurate.",

We know that the area of the yard is 240 square meters, so we can set up an equation: l x w = 240 We also know that Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. Since the unfenced side is the width of the yard, we can set up another equation: l + 2w = perimeter - 10 We need to find the perimeter of the yard, which is the total length of fencing that Alice needs. To do this, we need to eliminate \"l\" from the two equations above. We can solve the first equation for \"l\": l = 240 / w Substituting this into the second equation, we get: 240 / w + 2w = perimeter - 10 Simplifying this equation, we get: perimeter = 2w + 240 / w + 10 To find the value of \"w\" that minimizes the perimeter, we can take the derivative of the perimeter with respect to \"w\" and set it equal to zero: d(perimeter) / dw = 2 - 240 / w^2 = 0 Solving for \"w\", we get: w = sqrt(240) = 4sqrt(15) Substituting this value of \"w\" into the equation for the perimeter, we get: perimeter = 2(4sqrt(15)) + 240 / (4sqrt(15)) + 10 perimeter = 8sqrt(15) + 60sqrt(15) / 4 + 10 perimeter = 18sqrt(15) + 10 Therefore, Alice needs 18sqrt(15) + 10 meters of fencing.

Let's assume that the time taken by the ship to travel 180 miles is t hours. Therefore, the distance covered by the ship in t hours is 180 miles. We know that the speed of the plane is 10 times the speed of the ship. Therefore, the speed of the plane is 10x miles/hour. Let's assume that the time taken by the plane to meet the ship is t1 hours. Therefore, the distance covered by the plane in t1 hours is 10xt1 miles. Now, we know that the distance covered by the ship and the plane is the same when they meet.

After this process, the amount of sand in the mixture will be 3 kg + x kg, and the amount of clay will still be 7 kg. Step 3: Since we want the mixture to contain equal quantities of sand and clay, we need to make sure that the amount of sand is equal to the amount of clay.

How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000? Answer Choices: (A) 30000 (B) 415000 (C) 31500 (D) 50000 (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the monthly sale be x. The commission earned by the servant would be 15% of x, which is 0.15x. The total monthly income of the servant would be the sum of his salary and commission, which is 1500 + 0.15x. We know that the servant wants his monthly income to be 6000. So, we can set up an equation: 1500 + 0.15x = 6000 Solving for x, we get x = 30000. Therefore, the monthly sale in Rupees that the servant should do to earn a monthly income of 6000 is Rs. 30000.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that Sharon earns x amount of tips per hour and Karen earns y amount of tips per hour. We know that Sharon works for 5 hours and Karen works for 4 hours to earn enough tips to buy the cake. Therefore, we can write the equation: 5x + 4y = cost of the ice cream cake We also know that if they work together, they will be able to earn enough tips to buy the cake in less time. Let's assume that they work together for z hours to earn enough tips to buy the cake. Therefore, we can write the equation: (5 + 4) (x + y) z = cost of the ice cream cake Simplifying this equation, we get: 9 (x + y) z = cost of the ice cream cake We can now equate the two expressions for the cost of the ice cream cake: 5x + 4y = 9 (x + y) z Simplifying this equation, we get: z = (5x + 4y) / (9 (x + y)) We can now substitute the given values of x and y to find z: Let's assume that Sharon earns $s per hour and Karen earns $k per hour. We know that Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy the cake, so we can write: 5s = cost of the ice cream cake Similarly, we know that Karen works for 4 hours to earn enough tips to buy the cake, so we can write: 4k = cost of the ice cream cake Substituting these values in the equation for z, we get: z = (5s + 4k) / (9 (s + k)) We can simplify this expression as follows: z = (5/9) + (4/9) (k/s + 1) We know that k/s is the ratio of Karen's tips per hour to Sharon's tips per hour. Let's assume that k/s = r. Therefore, we can write: z = (5/9) + (4/9) (r + 1) Simplifying this expression, we get: z = (5/9) + (4/9) (r) + (4/9) Therefore, the answer is (B) 2 hours.",

So, the length of each section of the fence (one picket and the space on either side) is 1/2 + 6 + 1/2 = 7 inches. To convert this to feet, we divide by 12: 7 inches = 7/12 feet. The total length of the fence is the length of (x-1) sections of fence (since there are x-1 spaces between x pickets) plus the length of the two end pickets: Total length = (x-1)(7/12) + 1/2 + 1/2 Total length = (7/12)x - 7/12 + 1 Total length = (7/12)x + 5/6 Simplifying this expression, we get Total length = (13x + 10)/24 Therefore, the answer is (D) (13x+1)/24.

When they work together, their rates add up, so the combined rate is: 1/40 + 1/45 = 9/360 + 8/360 = 17/360 walls per minute. Now we can use the formula: time = work / rate, with work = 1 wall and rate = 17/360 walls per minute: time = 1 / (17/360) = 360 / 17 minutes.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's break down the problem. We need to form quadrilaterals by joining 4 of the points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Since F is at the center of the pentagon, any quadrilateral that includes F will be symmetric to another quadrilateral that does not include F. Therefore, we can count the number of quadrilaterals that do not include F and multiply by 2 to get the total number of quadrilaterals. \n\nLet's consider the quadrilaterals that do not include F. We can choose any 4 points out of the 5 points A, B, C, D, and E. This can be done in 5C4 = 5 ways. For each choice of 4 points, we can form a quadrilateral in the following ways: \n\n- 4 vertices of the quadrilateral are adjacent: There are 5 ways to choose the starting vertex, and only 1 way to form the quadrilateral. \n- 3 vertices of the quadrilateral are adjacent: There are 5 ways to choose the starting vertex, and 2 ways to choose the non-adjacent vertex. Therefore, there are 5 x 2 = 10 ways to form the quadrilateral. \n- 2 pairs of adjacent vertices: There are 5C2 = 10 ways to choose the pairs of adjacent vertices. For each pair, there is only 1 way to form the quadrilateral. Therefore, there are 10 x 1 = 10 ways to form the quadrilateral. \n\nSo, the total number of quadrilaterals that do not include F is 1 + 10 + 10 = 21.

We also know that this percentage is equal to the actual percentage of black marbles in the bag, which is y / (x + 20 + 20) * 100% = y / (x + 40) * 100%. Therefore, we can write: y / (x + 20) * 100% = y + 1 / (x + 39) * 100% Solving for x, we get: x = 380 Therefore, the bag currently holds x + 20 = 400 marbles. Therefore, the answer is (D) 400.

So, the length and width of the rectangular plot after gardening would be (l + 2) and (w + 2) respectively. The area of the gardening would be the difference between the area of the larger rectangle and the area of the smaller rectangle. Area of the larger rectangle = (l + 2) x (w + 2) Area of the smaller rectangle = l x w Therefore, the area of the gardening would be: Area of the gardening = (l + 2) x (w + 2) - l x w Area of the gardening = lw + 2l + 2w + 4 - lw Area of the gardening = 2l + 2w + 4 We know that the rate of gardening is $10 per square meter.

When the angle of elevation is 45\u00b0, we have: h/x = tan(45\u00b0) = 1 When the angle of elevation is 60\u00b0, we have: h/(x + d) = tan(60\u00b0) = \u221a3 Solving for h and x, we get: h = x and h = \u221a3(x + d) Equating these two expressions for h, we get: x = \u221a3(x + d) - x Simplifying this equation, we get: x = d(\u221a3 - 1) Therefore, the distance between the car and the base of the tower is d(\u221a3 - 1).

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Step 1: Let's represent the number of files infected only by a virus as V, the number of files infected only by a worm as W, and the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm as B. We know that: V + W + B = 250 W = 2.5B Step 2: We know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. This means that the number of files infected by a virus is 50% of 250, or 125. Therefore, the number of files not infected by a virus is 250 - 125, or 125. Step 3: We can use the information we have to set up an equation: V + B = 125 (since the number of files infected by a virus and both a virus and a worm add up to 125) We also know that W = 2.5B, so we can substitute that into the equation: V + B = 125 V + (1/2)W = 125 (since W = 2.5B, we can substitute (1/2)W for B) V + (1/2)(2.5B) = 125 V + 1.25B = 125 Step 4: We can now solve for V and B: V + 1.25B = 125 V + 1.25(1/2)W = 125 (since B = (1/2)W) V + 0.625W = 125 (dividing both sides by 2) 2.5B + 0.625W = 125 (substituting 2.5B for W) 2.5(250 - V - B) + 0.625W = 125 (substituting 250 - V - B for W) 625 - 2.5V - 2.5B + 0.625W = 125 (distributing the 2.5) 500 - 2.5V = 0 (combining like terms) V = 200 B = 20 W = 30 Step 5: We know that there are 30 files infected only by a worm, so the number of files not infected by a worm is 250 - 30, or 220.

This means that its vertical speed is 700/40 = 17.5 meters/second. - It takes 5 seconds to pass a point. This means that the total time taken to pass the point is 5 seconds. During this time, the space shuttle travels a horizontal distance equal to its length L. Let's use the formula: distance = speed x time to find the length of the space shuttle. We can use this formula for both the vertical and horizontal distances.

Let's assume that alloy X contains 6x grams of zinc and 9x grams of copper, and alloy Y contains 7y grams of zinc and 11y grams of copper. We know that 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z. Therefore, the total amount of zinc in alloy Z is 6x(40/100) + 7y(60/100) = 2.4x + 4.2y, and the total amount of copper in alloy Z is 9x(40/100) + 11y(60/100) = 3.6x + 6.6y. To find the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z, we can divide the total amount of zinc by the total amount of copper: (2.4x + 4.2y)/(3.6x + 6.6y) = (4x + 7y)/(6x + 11y) We can simplify this expression by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 11: (4x + 7y)/(6x + 11y) = (44x + 77y)/(66x + 121y) Now, we can simplify the ratio by dividing both the numerator and denominator by the greatest common factor, which is 11: (44x + 77y)/(66x + 121y) = 4x + 7y/6x + 11y Therefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 4x + 7y : 6x + 11y.

Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the wholesale cost of the appliance is $100. Then, the original retail price of the appliance is 60% more than the wholesale cost, which is $160. However, the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, which is 80% of $160, or $128. Now, we need to find the percentage that the appliance was sold for more than its wholesale cost. The profit percentage is given by: Profit percentage = [(Selling price - Cost price) / Cost price] x 100 Since the selling price is greater than the cost price, there is a profit. Profit percentage = [(128 - 100) / 100] x 100 = 28% Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 28%. The answer is B.",

            "Question": "Q: A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. What is the perimeter of the piece? Answer Choices: (A) 60 m (B) 61 m (C) 62 m (D) 63 m (E) 64 m",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the breadth of the rectangular piece is \"x\" meters. Then, according to the problem, the length of the rectangular piece is 4 times the breadth plus 1 meter. So, the length is (4x + 1) meters. We know that the area of the rectangular piece is 150 square meters. Therefore, we can write the equation: x(4x + 1) = 150 Simplifying this equation, we get: 4x^2 + x - 150 = 0 We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula: x = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a where a = 4, b = 1, and c = -150. Plugging in these values, we get: x = (-1 \u00b1 sqrt(1^2 - 4(4)(-150))) / 2(4) x = (-1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 2400)) / 8 x = (-1 \u00b1 sqrt(2401)) / 8 We can ignore the negative solution, since the breadth of the rectangular piece cannot be negative. Therefore, we get: x = (-1 + sqrt(2401)) / 8 x = 7/2 or x = 3.5 meters Now, we can find the length of the rectangular piece: Length = 4x + 1 = 4(3.5) + 1 = 15 meters Finally, we can find the perimeter of the rectangular piece: Perimeter = 2(length + breadth) = 2(15 + 3.5) = 2(18.5) = 37 meters Therefore, the answer is (B) 61 m.",

Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the speed of the elevator is x steps/minute and the total number of steps in the staircase is n. \n\nFrom the first statement, we can write: \n(n/2 - 20)/x + 10 = n/2x \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \nn/2x - 20/x + 10 = n/2x \nn/2x = 10 + 20/x \nnx = 40x + 20n \n\nFrom the second statement, we can write: \n(n/2 - 10)/x + 20 = n/2x \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \nn/2x - 10/x + 20 = n/2x \nn/2x = 20 - 10/x \nnx = 40x - 20n \n\nNow we can solve for x by equating the two expressions for nx: \n40x + 20n = 40x - 20n \n40n = 0 \n\nThis implies that n = 0, which is not possible. Therefore, there is no solution that satisfies both statements. \n\nHence, the answer is None of the above. The answer is E.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's break down the problem. We can use the concept of similar triangles to solve this problem. The electric pole and the tree are both standing upright, so their shadows will be proportional to their heights. Let's call the height of the tree \"h\". Then we can set up a proportion: height of pole / length of pole shadow = height of tree / length of tree shadow 14 / 10 = h / 15 Cross-multiplying, we get: 14 x 15 = 10h Simplifying, we get: h = 21 Therefore, the height of the tree is 21 meters.

            "Question": "Q: A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Step 1: Calculate the volume of the coin. Volume = \u03c0r^2h = \u03c0(7.5)^2(2) = 352.5 mm^3 Step 2: Since the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, we can assume that half of the volume of the coin is aluminum and the other half is silver. So, the volume of aluminum in the coin is 176.25 mm^3. Step 3: Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of the silver in the coin is twice that of the aluminum. Let the weight of the aluminum be x. Then, the weight of the silver is 2x. Step 4: We can set up an equation based on the weights of aluminum and silver in the coin: (x/2)(2.7) + (2x/2)(5.4) = 30 where 2.7 and 5.4 are the densities of aluminum and silver, respectively. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2.7x + 5.4x = 30 x = 30/8.1 = 3.7 grams Step 5: Now, we need to find the weight of a pure aluminum coin measuring 1 x 30 mm. The volume of this coin is: \u03c0r^2h = \u03c0(15)^2(1) = 225\u03c0 mm^3 The density of aluminum is 2.7 g/cm^3, which is equivalent to 2.7 x 10^-3 g/mm^3. So, the weight of the pure aluminum coin is: (225\u03c0)(2.7 x 10^-3) = 0.57 grams Step 6: Finally, we need to convert the weight of the pure aluminum coin from grams to milligrams, since the answer choices are in milligrams. 0.57 grams = 570 milligrams Therefore, the answer is (None of the above).
