Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the jar is full of 10 units of candies (it could be any unit of measurement). If P eats alone, he can eat 1 unit of candies in 10 minutes. So, his rate of eating is 1/10 units per minute. If Q eats alone, she can eat half the jar (i.e., 5 units) in 5 minutes. So, her rate of eating is 5/5 = 1 unit per minute. Now, let's assume that P and Q eat together and take t minutes to finish the jar. In t minutes, P can eat t/10 units of candies and Q can eat t/2 units of candies. Since they are eating the same jar, the total amount of candies eaten by P and Q must be equal to the total amount of candies in the jar. Therefore, we can set up an equation: t/10 + t/2 = 10 Solving for t, we get: t = 6 minutes Therefore, it would take them 6 minutes to empty the jar. Therefore, the answer is (C) 6. The answer is C.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Step 1: Let's find the combined rate of painting of all three painters. Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so his rate of painting is 1/6. Similarly, Mr. Black's rate of painting is 1/8, and Mr. Blue's rate of painting is 1/12. Therefore, the combined rate of painting of all three painters is: 1/6 + 1/8 + 1/12 = 6/24 + 3/24 + 2/24 = 11/24 houses per day.\n\nStep 2: After 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation. In these 8 days, the three painters together would have painted: 8 x (11/24) = 11/3 houses.\n\nStep 3: Mr. Brown is gone for 6 days, during which Mr. Black works alone. Let's assume that Mr. Black paints x houses in these 6 days. His rate of painting is 1/8, so we can set up an equation: x/6 + x/8 = 1\n\nMultiplying both sides by 24, we get: 4x + 3x = 24\n\nSimplifying, we get: 7x = 24\n\nDividing both sides by 7, we get: x = 24/7\n\nTherefore, Mr. Black paints 24/7 houses in 6 days.\n\nStep 4: Together, Mr. Black and Mr. Brown have painted: 11/3 + 24/7 = 71/21 houses.\n\nStep 5: To complete the contract, they need to paint 3 houses in total.

His rate of painting is 1/12, so we can set up an equation: x/12 = 32/21\n\nMultiplying both sides by 12, we get: x = 32/7\n\nTherefore, Mr. Blue takes 32/7 days to paint the remaining houses.\n\nStep 7: Let's simplify this answer. 32/7 can be written as 4 and 4/7. Therefore, Mr. Blue takes 4 days and approximately 10 hours to paint the remaining houses.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 10.",

From the problem, we know that: - The diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin, so the total amount earned from copper coins is 20x cents. - The diver gets 25 cents for each brass coin, so the total amount earned from brass coins is 25y cents. - The total amount earned from both types of coins is $3.40 or 340 cents. Therefore, we can set up an equation: 20x + 25y = 340 We need to find the minimum number of copper coins, which means we need to minimize the value of x. We can start by trying different values of x and see if we can get an integer value of y. If we try x = 1, then 20(1) + 25y = 340, which gives us y = 12.8. Since y is not an integer, we need to try a larger value of x. If we try x = 2, then 20(2) + 25y = 340, which gives us y = 10.4. Again, y is not an integer, so we need to try a larger value of x. If we try x = 3, then 20(3) + 25y = 340, which gives us y = 8. We have found an integer value of y, which means that the minimum number of copper coins is 3. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 3.

There are 4 candy bars that cost $2 each, so the number of ways to select 3 of them is 4C3 = 4. \n\n- Case 2: Two candy bars cost $2 each and one candy bar costs $1. There are 4 candy bars that cost $2 each and 4 candy bars that cost $1 each, so the number of ways to select 2 of the $2 candy bars and 1 of the $1 candy bars is 4C2 * 4C1 = 24. \n\n- Case 3: One candy bar costs $2, one candy bar costs $1, and one candy bar costs $0.50. There are 4 candy bars that cost $2 each, 4 candy bars that cost $1 each, and 3 candy bars that cost $0.50 each, so the number of ways to select 1 of the $2 candy bars, 1 of the $1 candy bars, and 1 of the $0.50 candy bars is 4C1 * 4C1 * 3C1 = 48. \n\nStep 4: The total number of ways to select 3 candy bars with a total cost of more than $4 is the sum of the number of ways from each case: 4 + 24 + 48 = 76. \n\nStep 5: Therefore, the probability of selecting 3 candy bars with a total cost of more than $4 is 76/165. \n\nStep 6: None of the answer choices match our answer, so the correct answer is None of the above.

We also know that 5 years back, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim. Let's assume that Rahim was y years old 5 years back. So, we can set up the equation: x = (1/3)y - 5 Solving for y, we get: y = (3/1)(x + 5) y = 3x + 15 Now, we need to find out Rahim's current age. 5 years have passed since we calculated Rahim's age 5 years back. So, Rahim's current age would be: y + 5 = 3x + 15 + 5 = 3x + 20 We know that Raj is currently 17 years old.

Let's call the smallest of these integers x. Then, the next two consecutive integers are x + 1 and x + 2. We have: x * (x + 1) * (x + 2) = 24 * 91 Simplifying this equation, we get: x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x - 2184 = 0 We can factor this equation as follows: (x - 12) * (x^2 + 15x + 182) = 0 The solutions to this equation are: x = 12, x = (-15 + sqrt(15^2 - 4*182))/2, and x = (-15 - sqrt(15^2 - 4*182))/2.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the original square piece of cloth had a side of length x feet. When 4 feet is trimmed from one edge, the rectangular piece has dimensions (x-4) by x. When this rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half, we get two right triangles with legs (x-4) and x. The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. Therefore, we can write the equation: (1/2) * (x-4) * x = 70 Solving this equation, we get: x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0 (x-14)(x+10) = 0 x = 14 (since x cannot be negative) Therefore, the original square piece of cloth had a side of length 14 feet.

Since each helper can make 2 large cakes in an hour, the total number of large cakes that can be made in 3 hours by one helper is 2 x 3 = 6. Similarly, since each helper can make 35 small cakes in an hour, the total number of small cakes that can be made in 3 hours by one helper is 35 x 3 = 105. Now, we can find out how many large cakes and small cakes can be made by n helpers in 3 hours. Let's say we need n helpers. Then, the total number of large cakes that can be made in 3 hours by n helpers is 20 (since we need 20 large cakes). Similarly, the total number of small cakes that can be made in 3 hours by n helpers is 700 (since we need 700 small cakes).

We know that the grocer made a profit of $3,000. Since the profit is 25% of the selling price, we can write: 0.25(1.25x) = $3,000 Simplifying this equation, we get: x = $80 Substituting x back into the equation, we get: 0.25(1.25x) = $3,000 0.25(1.25($80)) = $3,000 0.25($100) = $3,000 Therefore, the grocer sold 30 bags of flour.

Similarly, Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so he worked for 9y hours. We also know that both of them made 35 toys in total, so we can set up an equation: x + y = 35 Solving for x, we get: x = 35 - y Now, we can set up another equation based on the number of hours they worked: 7x + 9y = Total number of hours worked We don't know the total number of hours worked, but we know that both of them worked for almost similar number of hours. This means that the total number of hours worked is approximately the same for both of them. We can assume that the total number of hours worked is 35k, where k is some constant.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the number of trousers purchased be x and the number of shirts purchased be y. We know that the cost of each trouser is Rs. 70 and the cost of each shirt is Rs. 30. So, we can set up an equation: 70x + 30y = 810 We also know that we want to maximize the number of trousers purchased. This means that we want to use as much of the total cost as possible on trousers. Let's assume that we can buy all the trousers first and then use the remaining amount to buy shirts. The cost of x trousers is Rs. 70x. So, the remaining amount that can be used to buy shirts is: 810 - 70x We know that the cost of each shirt is Rs. 30. So, the number of shirts that can be purchased with the remaining amount is: (810 - 70x) / 30 Now, we can set up the ratio of trousers to shirts: x : (810 - 70x) / 30 Simplifying this ratio, we get: x : (27 - 2x) / 3 To maximize the number of trousers, we need to maximize x. This means that we need to minimize (27 - 2x) / 3. The minimum value of this expression occurs when (27 - 2x) is minimum. The minimum value of (27 - 2x) is 1 when x = 13.5. However, we cannot purchase a fraction of a trouser. Therefore, we need to round down to the nearest integer. This means that we can purchase a maximum of 13 trousers. The remaining amount that can be used to buy shirts is: 810 - 70(13) = 100 So, the number of shirts that can be purchased with this amount is: 100 / 30 = 10/3 We cannot purchase a fraction of a shirt. Therefore, we need to round down to the nearest integer. This means that we can purchase a maximum of 10 shirts. Therefore, the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased is: 13 : 10 Simplifying this ratio, we get: 26 : 20 or 13 : 10 Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above.

So, the number of women who took the survey is 0.6x and the number of men who took the survey is 0.4x. Step 2: Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. So, the number of men who preferred red cars is 0.75(0.4x) = 0.3x and the number of men who preferred green cars is 0.25(0.4x) = 0.1x. Step 3: If 10 men liked green cars more than red, then we can write the equation: 0.3x - 0.1x = 10 Solving for x, we get: 0.2x = 10 x = 50 Therefore, the total number of people who took the survey is 50.

We know that the distance traveled by both trains is the same. Let's assume that the distance between City A and City B is d km. Therefore, the distance traveled by Train M in x hours is d, and the distance traveled by Train N in (x - 2) hours is also d. We can use the formula: distance = speed x time. Let's assume that the speed of Train M is sm km/hr and the speed of Train N is sn km/hr. Therefore, we get the following two equations: d = sm x x and d = sn x (x - 2) Solving these equations, we get: x = 2d/(sm + sn) Substituting the values given in the question, we get: x = 2d/(60 + 42) = d/51 Therefore, the two trains meet after d/51 hours from 5 am.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the current population of Boomtown is 100. According to the projection, the population will increase by 10% per year for the next two years.

So, we can set up the equation: (0.4 + x)/(1 + x) = 0.6 Solving this equation, we get: x = 0.5 Therefore, we need to add 0.5 gallons of pure orange juice to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink.

Since both hoses working together filled the remaining 3/4 of the pool, their rate for 3 hours is 3/4 divided by (1/8 + x) or (3/4) / (1/8 + x) of the pool per hour. Therefore, both hoses filled (3/4) / (1/8 + x) of the pool in the last 3 hours. Step 5: Set up an equation based on the principle that the total amount of water filled by both hoses is equal to the amount of water needed to fill the pool. The equation is: 1/4 + (3/4) / (1/8 + x) = 1 Step 6: Solve for x. Multiplying both sides by 8 + 8x, we get: 2 + 6 = 8 + 8x 8x = 0 x = 0 Step 7: Find the time it would take hose B to fill the entire pool. Since hose B's rate is 0, it would take an infinite amount of time for hose B to fill the entire pool. Therefore, the answer is None of the above. The answer is E.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's call the two numbers x and y. We are given that the difference between their squares is 256000, so we can write: x^2 - y^2 = 256000 This can be factored as: (x + y)(x - y) = 256000 We are also given that the sum of the numbers is 1000, so we can write: x + y = 1000 We can use these two equations to solve for x and y. First, we can use the equation x + y = 1000 to solve for y in terms of x: y = 1000 - x Next, we can substitute this expression for y into the factored equation: (x + y)(x - y) = 256000 (x + (1000 - x))(x - (1000 - x)) = 256000 Simplifying this expression, we get: 4x^2 - 4000x + 1000000 = 256000 Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x^2 - 1000x + 160000 = 0 This is a quadratic equation that can be solved using the quadratic formula: x = [1000 \u00b1 sqrt(1000^2 - 4*160000)]/2 x = [1000 \u00b1 sqrt(600000)]/2 x = [1000 \u00b1 200sqrt(15)]/2 We can simplify this expression by factoring out a 2: x = 500 \u00b1 100sqrt(15) Therefore, the two numbers are approximately 500 + 100sqrt(15) and 500 - 100sqrt(15).

Let's write out M and N in terms of their digits: M = 100a + 10b + c N = 100c + 10b + a Since M > N, we have: 100a + 10b + c > 100c + 10b + a Simplifying this inequality, we get: 99a - 99c > 0 a - c > 0 a > c Now, let's substitute our expressions for M and N into the equation M - N + 396c = 990: 100a + 10b + c - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990 Simplifying this equation, we get: 199a - 299c = 990 199a = 299c + 990 Dividing both sides by 199, we get: a = (299/199)c + (990/199) Since a is an integer, we know that (299/199)c + (990/199) must be an integer.

Therefore, we can write the equation: L x B = 240 We also know that Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. Therefore, the perimeter of the yard that needs to be fenced is: 2L + B - 10 meters We can now use the fact that the perimeter of the yard is equal to the length of fencing needed. Therefore, we can write the equation: 2L + B - 10 = length of fencing needed We need to solve for the length of fencing needed. We can use the equation for the area of the yard to eliminate one variable. L x B = 240 B = 240/L Substituting this value of B in the equation for the perimeter, we get: 2L + 240/L - 10 = length of fencing needed Multiplying both sides by L, we get: 2L^2 + 240 - 10L = L x length of fencing needed Rearranging the terms, we get: 2L^2 - L x length of fencing needed + 240 - 10L = 0 We know that the length of the yard cannot be negative. Therefore, we can eliminate one of the roots of the quadratic equation. The other root gives us the length of fencing needed. Using the quadratic formula, we get: L = (10 + sqrt(100 + 1920 x length of fencing needed))/4 Substituting the value of L in the equation for the perimeter, we get: length of fencing needed = 2L + 240/L - 10 We can now substitute the value of L from the quadratic formula and solve for the length of fencing needed.

Let's say we remove z kg of the mixture. So, the new weight of the mixture will be (10-z) kg. We replace z kg of the mixture with pure sand. So, the new weight of sand in the mixture will be (x-z+z) = x kg. And the new weight of clay in the mixture will be (y-z) kg. We want the mixture to contain equal quantities of sand and clay. So, we can write the equation: x = y (equation 3) Now, we have three equations (equations 1, 2, and 3) and three variables (x, y, and z). We can solve for these variables. From equation 3, we get: y = x Substituting this in equation 1, we get: x + x = 10 2x = 10 x = 5 So, the initial weight of sand in the mixture was 5 kg. And the initial weight of clay in the mixture was (10-5) = 5 kg. Substituting x=5 in equation 2, we get: 0.3*5 + 0.7y = 5 0.7y = 3.5 y = 5 Therefore, the initial weight of clay in the mixture was also 5 kg.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can start by finding the amount of tips each person earns per hour. Let's assume that Sharon earns x dollars per hour and Karen earns y dollars per hour. We know that Sharon works for 5 hours and earns enough tips to buy the cake, so we can write: 5x = cost of the cake Similarly, Karen works for 4 hours and earns enough tips to buy the cake, so we can write: 4y = cost of the cake If we add these two equations, we get: 5x + 4y = 2(cost of the cake) Now, we want to find out how many hours it will take for them to earn enough tips to buy the cake together. Let's assume that they work together for z hours. During this time, Sharon earns 5z dollars and Karen earns 4z dollars. We want the total amount they earn to be equal to the cost of the cake, so we can write: 5z + 4z = cost of the cake Solving for the cost of the cake, we get: cost of the cake = 9z Now, we can substitute this value into the previous equation: 5x + 4y = 18z Dividing both sides by 9, we get: (5/9)x + (4/9)y = 2 Solving for x, we get: x = (18/5) - (4/5)y Substituting this value into the equation for Sharon's earnings, we get: 5[(18/5) - (4/5)y] = cost of the cake Solving for the cost of the cake, we get: cost of the cake = 18 - 4y Substituting this value into the equation for the total amount earned, we get: 9z = 18 - 4y Solving for z, we get: z = (18 - 4y)/9 Now, we want to find out when z is an integer (i.e. when they can earn enough tips to buy the cake together). We can try different values of y and see which ones give an integer value for z. If y = 1, then z = 2 If y = 2, then z = 2 If y = 3, then z = 2 If y = 4, then z = 2 If y = 5, then z = 2 If y = 6, then z = 2 If y = 7, then z = 2 If y = 8, then z = 2 If y = 9, then z = 2 Therefore, they can earn enough tips to buy the cake together after 2 hours of work. So the answer is (B) 2 hours.",

In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 28 (C) 30 (D) 53 (E) 59",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Given: - The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days - It takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies if there is exactly one water lily on the lake. - Initially, there were 64 water lilies on the lake. We need to find out how many days it will take for the lake to be fully covered with lilies. Let's start by finding out how many times the number of water lilies doubles to reach the fully covered state. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, and the number of lilies doubles every two days, then after 2 days there will be 2 lilies, after 4 days there will be 4 lilies, after 6 days there will be 8 lilies, and so on. In general, the number of lilies after \"n\" days can be given by the formula: Number of lilies = 2^(n/2) If it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies if there is exactly one water lily on the lake, then we can set up an equation: 2^(60/2) = 2^30 = 1,073,741,824 lilies Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the lake to be fully covered with lilies if there were initially 64 lilies. We can use the same formula: Number of lilies = 2^(n/2) If there were initially 64 lilies, then the equation becomes: 2^(n/2) = 1,073,741,824 / 64 = 16,777,216 Taking the square root of both sides, we get: 2^(n/4) = 4,096 Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get: n/4 = log2(4,096) n/4 = 12 n = 48 Therefore, it will take 48 days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies if there were initially 64 lilies.

The probability that all n students answer the question incorrectly is (4/5)^n. Therefore, the probability that at least one student answers the question correctly is 1 - (4/5)^n. Since Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, we know that n = 1.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can start by selecting any four points from the five points A, B, C, D, and E. There are 5 ways to choose the first point, 4 ways to choose the second point (since we can't choose the same point twice), 3 ways to choose the third point, and 2 ways to choose the fourth point. However, we need to divide by 5 to correct for overcounting since the order in which we choose the points doesn't matter. Therefore, the total number of quadrilaterals we can form is:\n\n(5 x 4 x 3 x 2) / 5 = 24 / 5 = 4.8\n\nHowever, we need to consider that some of these quadrilaterals will be congruent to each other due to the symmetry of the pentagon. Specifically, any quadrilateral that can be obtained from another quadrilateral by rotating or reflecting it will be congruent. There are 5 lines of symmetry in a regular pentagon, so any quadrilateral that is symmetric with respect to one of these lines will be congruent to another quadrilateral. There are two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: The quadrilateral contains the center point F. In this case, the quadrilateral will be symmetric with respect to any line passing through F and one of the vertices of the pentagon. There are 5 such lines, so there are 5 congruence classes of quadrilaterals in this case.\n\nCase 2: The quadrilateral does not contain the center point F.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The frog jumps 3m up and falls back 2m down, so it makes a net progress of 1m each day. To come out of the well, the frog needs to make a progress of 30m. So, it will take 30 days for the frog to come out of the well if it makes a net progress of 1m each day. However, we need to consider that the frog makes a net progress of 1m only on the days it jumps up. On the days it falls back, it does not make any progress. So, we need to calculate how many days the frog needs to jump up to a height of 30m. On the 29th day, the frog will jump up to a height of 87m (29 days x 3m/day). Since the well is only 30m deep, the frog will come out of the well on the 29th day itself. Therefore, the answer is (E) 29 days. The answer is E.",

The sum of k consecutive integers starting from x is: k/2 * (x + (x + k - 1)) = k/2 * (-50 + (-50 + k - 1)) = k/2 * (-100 + k - 1) = k/2 * (k - 101) We know that this sum is equal to 51.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Step 1: Let's represent the number of files infected only by a virus as V, the number of files infected only by a worm as W, and the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm as B. We know that: V + W + B = 250 W = 2.5B Step 2: We know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. This means that the number of files infected by a virus is 50% of 250, or 125. Therefore, the number of files not infected by a virus is 250 - 125, or 125. Step 3: We can use the information we have about W and B to set up an equation: W + B = 125 + 125 = 250 2.5B + B = 250 3.5B = 250 B = 71.43 (rounded to two decimal places) Step 4: We can use the value of B to find the values of W and V: W = 2.5B = 2.5 x 71.43 = 178.57 (rounded to two decimal places) V = 125 - 71.43 = 53.57 (rounded to two decimal places) Step 5: We want to find the number of files that were not infected by a worm. This is equal to the number of files infected only by a virus, plus the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm: V + B = 53.57 + 71.43 = 125 Therefore, the answer is (E) 125.

Since the same number of boys and girls joined the group, we can say that there are now 64 + x boys and 40 + x girls in the group. We know that the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, so: (64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4/3 Cross-multiplying: 3(64 + x) = 4(40 + x) Solving for \"x\": 192 + 3x = 160 + 4x x = 32 Therefore, 32 boys and 32 girls joined the group.

Answer Choices: (A) After 6 minutes (B) After 12 minutes (C) After 18 minutes (D) After 24 minutes (E) none",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Step 1: Let's find the time it takes for each bell to ring once. Bell 1 rings every 36 seconds, so it will ring 100 times in 3600 seconds (1 hour). Therefore, it takes 36 seconds for Bell 1 to ring once. Similarly, Bell 2 rings every 40 seconds, so it will ring 90 times in 3600 seconds. Therefore, it takes 40 seconds for Bell 2 to ring once. Bell 3 rings every 48 seconds, so it will ring 75 times in 3600 seconds. Therefore, it takes 48 seconds for Bell 3 to ring once.\n\nStep 2: Let's find the time it takes for all three bells to ring together again. This is the least common multiple (LCM) of 36, 40, and 48 seconds. We can find the LCM by prime factorizing each number and taking the highest power of each prime factor.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's first find the amount of zinc and copper in 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y. For alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. So, out of 40 grams of alloy X, 2/5 * 40 = 16 grams is zinc and 3/5 * 40 = 24 grams is copper. For alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which does not simplify. So, out of 60 grams of alloy Y, 7/18 * 60 = 23.33 grams is zinc and 11/18 * 60 = 36.67 grams is copper (rounded to two decimal places). Now, we can add the amounts of zinc and copper in the two alloys to get the amounts in alloy Z. The total amount of alloy Z is 40 + 60 = 100 grams. So, the amount of zinc in alloy Z is 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams and the amount of copper in alloy Z is 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams (rounded to two decimal places). Therefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 39.33:60.67, which simplifies to 59:91. So, the correct answer is (B) 59:91. The answer is B.",

Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the volume of the coin. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = \u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Here, the radius is 7.5 mm and the height is 2 mm. So, the volume of the coin is V = \u03c0(7.5)^2(2) = 352.5\u03c0 mm^3. \n\nNext, we know that the weight of the coin is 30 grams. Let's assume that the coin is made up of x grams of aluminum and y grams of silver. Since the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, we can write:\n\n\u03c1_aluminum x V_aluminum = \u03c1_silver x V_silver\n\nwhere \u03c1_aluminum and \u03c1_silver are the densities of aluminum and silver, respectively. We also know that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, so:\n\n\u03c1_silver = 2\u03c1_aluminum\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\nx/\u03c1_aluminum = y/\u03c1_silver\n\nx/\u03c1_aluminum = y/2\u03c1_aluminum\n\nx = y/2\n\nNow, we can write an equation for the weight of the coin:\n\nx + y = 30\n\nSubstituting x = y/2, we get:\n\n3y/2 = 30\n\ny = 20\n\nSo, the coin is made up of 10 grams of aluminum and 20 grams of silver. Since the volume of the coin is the same as that of the pure aluminum coin, we can write:\n\n\u03c1_aluminum x V_coin = \u03c1_aluminum x V_pure_aluminum\n\nSubstituting the values we know, we get:\n\n2.7 x 352.5\u03c0 = \u03c1_aluminum x \u03c0(15/2)^2(1)\n\nSolving for \u03c1_aluminum, we get:\n\n\u03c1_aluminum = 2.7 x 352.5/(15/2)^2\n\n\u03c1_aluminum = 0.098 g/mm^3\n\nFinally, we can find the weight of the pure aluminum coin:\n\n\u03c1_aluminum x V_pure_aluminum = 0.098 x \u03c0(15)^2(1) = 70.69 g\n\nTherefore, the weight of the pure aluminum coin is 70.69 grams.

The closest answer choice is (A) 13.3542, but this is not a close enough approximation. None of the answer choices are a good match, so the answer is None of the above. The answer is E.",
