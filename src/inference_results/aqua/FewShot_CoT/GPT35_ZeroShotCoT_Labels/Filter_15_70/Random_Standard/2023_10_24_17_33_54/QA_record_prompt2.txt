Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The problem states that one gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. Let's call the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E \"E\" and the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A \"A\". \n\nSo, one gram of the health food contains 0.09E of vitamin E and 0.08A of vitamin A. \n\nTo find out how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to set up an equation. Let's call the number of grams of the health food \"x\". \n\nWe want to find the value of \"x\" that satisfies the following two conditions: \n\n- The amount of vitamin E in \"x\" grams of the health food is at least equal to \"E\". \n- The amount of vitamin A in \"x\" grams of the health food is at least equal to \"A\". \n\nWe can write these conditions as: \n\n0.09E x >= E \n0.08A x >= A \n\nSimplifying these inequalities, we get: \n\nx >= E / 0.09 \nx >= A / 0.08 \n\nTo satisfy both conditions, we need to choose the larger value of \"x\". So, the minimum value of \"x\" that satisfies both conditions is: \n\nx = max(E / 0.09, A / 0.08) \n\nPlugging in the values of \"E\" and \"A\", we get: \n\nx = max(1 / 0.09, 1 / 0.08) \nx = max(11.11, 12.5) \nx = 12.5 \n\nTherefore, we need to eat at least 12.5 grams of the health food daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins. \n\nThe answer is (C) 12.5.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nLet's assume that the total work is represented by the variable 'W'. \n\nJack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of work is:\n\n1/12 of the work per hour.\n\nOn a particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work. So, the remaining work is:\n\nW - (2/3)W = (1/3)W\n\nNow, Jill has to finish the remaining work. Her rate of work is just 5% of what Jack can do. So, her rate of work is:\n\n(5/100) * (1/12) = (1/240) of the work per hour.\n\nLet's assume that Jill takes 'x' hours to finish the remaining work. So, her work rate is:\n\n1/x of the work per hour.\n\nNow, we can set up an equation using the work rates of Jack and Jill:\n\n(1/12) * (2/3)W + (1/240) * x = (1/3)W\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nW/40 + x/240 = W/3\n\nMultiplying both sides by 240, we get:\n\n6W + x = 80W/3\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx = (50/3)W\n\nSo, Jill takes (50/3) hours to finish the remaining work.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.",

Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Step 1: The company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. So, the total revenue from the sale of pens will be 7200 x 10 = Rs. 72,000.\n\nStep 2: The company estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. So, the total profit will be 25% of the total revenue, which is (25/100) x 72,000 = Rs. 18,000.\n\nStep 3: Now, we need to find the cost of manufacturing each pen. Let's assume that the cost of manufacturing each pen is x.\n\nStep 4: We know that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. So, the company can only sell 90% of the produced pens. Therefore, the total number of pens produced will be (7200/90) x 100 = 8000.\n\nStep 5: The total cost of manufacturing 8000 pens will be 8000x.\n\nStep 6: We can now write an equation based on the information we have:\n\nTotal revenue - Total cost = Total profit\n72,000 - (8000x) = 18,000\n\nStep 7: Solving for x, we get:\n\nx = 6\n\nTherefore, the cost of manufacturing each pen is Rs. 6.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The common difference between the ages of the members is 3 months, which is equivalent to 1/4 of a year. Let's denote the number of members in the club by n, and the age of the youngest member by a.\n\nThen, the age of the oldest member is a + (n-1)(1/4) years, since the ages form an arithmetic progression.\n\nThe sum of the ages of all the members is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression:\n\nsum = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)(1/4))\n\nWe are given that the sum is 250, so we can substitute and simplify:\n\n250 = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)(1/4))\n500 = n(2a + (n-1)(1/4))\n500 = 2an + (n^2 - n)(1/4)\n2000 = 8an + n^2 - n\nn^2 + (8a-1)n - 2000 = 0\n\nNow we have a quadratic equation in n. We know that n must be a positive integer, so we can solve for n using the quadratic formula:\n\nn = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))/2a or n = (-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))/2a\n\nwhere a = 1, b = 8a-1, and c = -2000. We can simplify this to:\n\nn = (1 - 8a + sqrt(64a^2 - 4(1)(-2000)))/2 or n = (1 - 8a - sqrt(64a^2 - 4(1)(-2000)))/2\n\nWe can simplify the expression under the square root:\n\n64a^2 + 8000 = 64(a^2 + 125)\n\nSo the expression under the square root is a perfect square when a = 7. Plugging in a = 7, we get:\n\nn = (1 - 8(7) + sqrt(64(7^2) + 5000))/2 = 25\n\nSo there are 25 members in the club.",

Then we have:\n\nTa + Tj = 35 toys\n\nWe also know that both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours, so we can assume that they have worked for the same amount of time.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how much the grocery store paid for each bag of ice. Since the store makes a 20% profit, that means the selling price is 120% of the cost price. We can set up an equation to solve for the cost price:\n\n1.2x = 1.25\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 1.25/1.2 = 1.04\n\nSo the store paid $1.04 for each bag of ice.\n\nNext, we can find out how much profit the store makes on each bag of ice:\n\nProfit per bag = Selling price - Cost price\nProfit per bag = 1.25 - 1.04\nProfit per bag = 0.21\n\nSo the store makes $0.21 profit on each bag of ice.\n\nFinally, we can find out the total profit the store makes by multiplying the profit per bag by the number of bags sold:\n\nTotal profit = Profit per bag x Number of bags sold\nTotal profit = 0.21 x 500\nTotal profit = 105\n\nTherefore, the grocery store makes a total profit of $105.

So, we can use the formula:\n\ndistance = speed x time\n\nFor Ram, the distance he covers in 10 seconds is:\n\ndistance = speed x time = 20 x 10 = 200 meters\n\nSimilarly, for Krishna, the distance he covers in 10 seconds is:\n\ndistance = speed x time = 40 x 10 = 400 meters\n\nAs they meet at point C, the total distance between A and B is the sum of the distances AC and BC. We know that AC = 200 meters. So, we just need to find BC.\n\nLet's assume that the distance between B and C is y meters. As Ram and Krishna are moving towards each other, the total distance they cover is x + y meters. We also know that they cover this distance in 10 seconds at a relative speed of 60 m/s.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nLet's assume that there are 'x' children in the row.\n\nAccording to the question, Neha is 12th from the left end and Radha is 6th from the right end.\n\nSo, the number of children between Neha and Radha = (x - 12 - 6 + 1) = (x - 17).\n\nNow, when Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places, she will be at (6 + 2) = 8th position from the right end.\n\nSimilarly, when Neha is shifted to the right by 2 places, she will be at (12 - 2) = 10th position from the left end.\n\nNow, there are 6 children between Radha and Neha. So, the number of children between Radha and Neha after they are shifted = 6 + 2 + 2 = 10.\n\nTherefore, (x - 17) - 10 = (8 + 10) - 1\n\n=> x - 27 = 17\n\n=> x = 44\n\nHence, there are 44 children in the row. \n\nTherefore, the answer is None of the above.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.\n\nLet's assume that there are a total of 100 students in the class. Let the number of passing students be x and the number of failing students be y.\n\nWe know that the overall class average was 76. So, the total score of all the students in the class is:\n\nTotal score = 76 x 100 = 7600\n\nWe also know that the passing students had an average of 83. So, the total score of passing students is:\n\nTotal score of passing students = 83x\n\nSimilarly, the total score of failing students is:\n\nTotal score of failing students = 55y\n\nWe can also write the following equations:\n\nx + y = 100 (since the total number of students is 100)\nTotal score of passing students + Total score of failing students = Total score of all students\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\n83x + 55y = 7600\n\nWe need to find the percentage of students who passed. We know that x students passed out of 100 students. So, the percentage of students who passed is:\n\nPercentage of students who passed = (x/100) x 100 = x\n\nWe need to find the value of x. Let's solve the equations to find the value of x.\n\nFrom the equation x + y = 100, we get:\n\ny = 100 - x\n\nSubstituting this value in the equation 83x + 55y = 7600, we get:\n\n83x + 55(100 - x) = 7600\n83x + 5500 - 55x = 7600\n28x = 2100\nx = 75\n\nTherefore, 75% of the class passed.

Let's call the total deer population in the forest \"x\". We know that 300 deer were tagged in 2001, so the proportion of tagged deer in the forest at the beginning of 2002 was 300/x.\n\nWe can set up a proportion to solve for x:\n\n300/x = 0.04\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n300 = 0.04x\n\nDividing both sides by 0.04, we get:\n\nx = 7500\n\nTherefore, the total deer population in the forest is 7500.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nLet's assume that the two ants meet after time t hours. \n\nIn that time, ant A would have traveled a distance of 9t cm (since it moves at a speed of 9 cm per hour) and ant B would have traveled a distance of 6t cm (since it moves at a speed of 6 cm per hour). \n\nSince they are moving towards each other, the total distance between them is decreasing at a rate of (9 + 6) = 15 cm per hour. \n\nTherefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n75 = (9t + 6t)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n75 = 15t\n\nt = 5\n\nSo the two ants will meet after 5 hours. \n\nNow, we can find the distance that ant A travels until meeting ant B by substituting t = 5 into the expression we derived earlier:\n\nDistance traveled by ant A = 9t = 9 x 5 = 45 cm\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 45.",

Let's solve for A:\n\nA = 17 - B - C \n\nNow we can substitute this expression for A into the second equation:\n\n(17 - B - C)^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109 \n\nExpanding the left side and simplifying, we get:\n\n2B^2 + 2C^2 - 34B - 34C + 90 = 0 \n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nB^2 + C^2 - 17B - 17C + 45 = 0 \n\nWe can rewrite this equation as:\n\n(B - 8.5)^2 + (C - 8.5)^2 = 3.25 \n\nThis equation represents a circle with center (8.5, 8.5) and radius sqrt(3.25) = 1.8. The solutions for B and C must lie on this circle. \n\nWe also know that the number represented by ABC minus 495 is equal to the number represented by CBA. In other words:\n\n100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100C + 10B + A \n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n99A - 99C = 495 \n\nDividing both sides by 99, we get:\n\nA - C = 5 \n\nWe can use this equation to further narrow down the possible values of B and C. \n\nSince A + B + C = 17, we know that B + C = 17 - A. Substituting A - C = 5, we get:\n\nB + C = 12 \n\nNow we can use this equation to solve for B in terms of C:\n\nB = 12 - C \n\nSubstituting this expression for B into the equation for the circle, we get:\n\n(C - 8.5)^2 + (3.5 - C)^2 = 3.25 \n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n2C^2 - 34C + 90 = 0 \n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nC^2 - 17C + 45 = 0 \n\nFactoring, we get:\n\n(C - 5)(C - 12) = 0 \n\nSo C = 5 or C = 12. \n\nIf C = 5, then B = 7 and A = 5 + 7 + 5 = 17, which is not possible since A must be a digit between 1 and 9. \n\nIf C = 12, then B = 0 and A = 17 - 12 = 5. So the number is 512. \n\nTo check, we can verify that the sum of the digits is 5 + 1 + 2 = 8, and the sum of the squares of the digits is 5^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 = 30. \n\nFinally, we can check that 512 - 495 = 17, which is equal to CBA (i.e. 215).",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nLet the marked price be x.\n\nAccording to the question, Karan makes a 20% profit even after offering a 20% discount.\n\nSo, the selling price after a 20% discount would be 0.8x.\n\nAnd, the cost price of the sewing machine is Rs. 1200.\n\nTherefore, 20% profit on the cost price would be (1200 x 20)/100 = Rs. 240.\n\nSo, the selling price of the sewing machine should be Rs. 1200 + Rs. 240 = Rs. 1440.\n\nNow, we know that the selling price after a 20% discount is 0.8x.\n\nSo, we can write the equation:\n\n0.8x = 1440\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 1440/0.8 = Rs. 1800\n\nTherefore, the marked price of the sewing machine should be Rs. 1800.\n\nHence, the answer is (E) 1,800.",

Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B? Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's start by setting up some variables to represent the distance between A and B, as well as the time it takes Kevin to travel each way. Let's call the distance between A and B \"d\", the time it takes Kevin to travel from A to B \"t1\", and the time it takes him to travel from B to A \"t2\". \n\nWe know that Kevin drives at a constant speed of 70 mph from A to B, so we can use the formula distance = rate x time to set up an equation: \n\nd = 70t1 \n\nWe also know that he drives at a constant speed of 90 mph from B to A, so we can set up another equation: \n\nd = 90t2 \n\nWe're given that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin was still approaching B and was only 70 miles away from it. Let's call the time at which he was 70 miles away from B \"t3\". We know that he has 3 hours left in his trip at this point, so we can set up another equation: \n\n70 = 90(t3 - t2) \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nt3 - t2 = 7/9 \n\nNow we have three equations: \n\nd = 70t1 \n\nd = 90t2 \n\nt3 - t2 = 7/9 \n\nWe can use these equations to solve for the distance between A and B. \n\nFirst, let's solve for t2 in terms of t1: \n\nd = 90t2 \n\nt2 = d/90 \n\nNow we can substitute this expression for t2 into the third equation: \n\nt3 - (d/90) = 7/9 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 90, we get: \n\n90t3 - d = 70 \n\nWe can use the first equation to substitute for d: \n\n90t3 - 70t1 = 70 \n\nWe're given that Kevin has exactly 3 hours left in his trip when he is 70 miles away from B. Let's call the total time for his trip \"T\". We know that he has 3 hours left at this point, so: \n\nT - t3 = 3 \n\nSolving for t3, we get: \n\nt3 = T - 3 \n\nNow we can substitute this expression for t3 into the equation we just derived: \n\n90(T - 3) - 70t1 = 70 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n90T - 270 - 70t1 = 70 \n\n90T - 70t1 = 340 \n\nDividing both sides by 10, we get: \n\n9T - 7t1 = 34 \n\nWe know that the ratio of the distances between A and B to B and A is 4:9, so we can set up another equation: \n\nd/(2d) = 4/9 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nd = 360 \n\nNow we can substitute this value for d into the equation we just derived: \n\n9T - 7t1 = 34 \n\n9T - 7(360/70) = 34 \n\n9T - 25.2 = 34 \n\n9T = 59.2 \n\nT = 6.58 \n\nSo the total time for Kevin's trip is 6.58 hours. We know that he has 3 hours left when he is 70 miles away from B, so he must have spent 3.58 hours traveling from A to B. We can use the equation d = 70t1 to solve for the distance between A and B: \n\nd = 70t1 \n\nd = 70(3.58) \n\nd = 250.6 \n\nSo the distance between A and B is approximately 250.6 miles. \n\nThe answer is (E) None of the above, since none of the answer choices match this value.",

We are given that the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4. This means that for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green sweets.\n\nNext, we are told that there are 120 green sweets in the bag. We can use this information to find the total number of sweets in the bag. Since the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4, we know that the total ratio of sweets is 3+4=7. This means that for every 7 sweets, 4 are green. Therefore, the total number of sweets in the bag is:\n\n120 x 7/4 = 210\n\nNow that we know the total number of sweets in the bag, we can use the ratio of red sweets to green sweets to find the number of red sweets. Since the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4, we know that for every 7 sweets, 3 are red.

Substituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n(x+1000-x)(x-(1000-x)) = 256000\n(2x-1000)(2x-1000) = 256000\n4x^2 - 4000x + 1000000 = 256000\n4x^2 - 4000x + 744000 = 0\nx^2 - 1000x + 186000 = 0\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (1000 \u00b1 sqrt(1000^2 - 4(1)(186000))) / 2\nx = (1000 \u00b1 sqrt(196000)) / 2\nx = (1000 \u00b1 140) / 2\n\nWe get two possible values for x:\n\nx = 570 or x = 430\n\nIf x = 570, then y = 430, and we can check that this satisfies both equations. If x = 430, then y = 570, and we can also check that this satisfies both equations. Therefore, the answer is (B) 628, 372.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we know that M > N, which means that abc > cba. This implies that a > c or a = c and b > a or b = a and c > b.\n\nNext, we can write M - N as (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99(a - c). Therefore, we have:\n\n99(a - c) + 396c = 990\na - c + 4c = 10\na - 3c = 10\n\nSince a and c are digits, we can see that the only possible values for (a, c) are (4, 2) and (7, 5).

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nLet's assume that the length of the rectangular yard is L meters and the width is W meters. \n\nWe know that the area of the yard is 240 square meters, so we can write:\n\nL x W = 240\n\nWe also know that Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. This means that the perimeter of the yard will be:\n\nP = 2L + W - 10\n\nWe need to find the length of fencing required for three sides, which is:\n\nFencing = 2L + 2W\n\nWe can use the first equation to solve for one of the variables. Let's solve for L:\n\nL = 240/W\n\nNow we can substitute this value of L in the equation for the perimeter:\n\nP = 2(240/W) + W - 10\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nP = (480/W) + W - 10\n\nTo find the value of W that minimizes the perimeter, we can take the derivative of P with respect to W and set it equal to zero:\n\ndP/dW = -480/W^2 + 1 = 0\n\nSolving for W, we get:\n\nW = sqrt(480) = 4sqrt(30)\n\nSubstituting this value of W in the equation for L, we get:\n\nL = 240/W = 240/(4sqrt(30)) = 15sqrt(30)\n\nNow we can substitute these values of L and W in the equation for fencing:\n\nFencing = 2L + 2W = 2(15sqrt(30)) + 2(4sqrt(30)) = 34sqrt(30)\n\nRounding this to the nearest integer, we get:\n\nFencing = 62\n\nTherefore, Alice needs 62 meters of fencing.

Therefore, the speed of the plane is 10x miles per hour.\n\nLet's assume that they meet after t hours. \n\nDistance traveled by the ship in t hours = x * t\n\nDistance traveled by the plane in t hours = 10x * t\n\nAccording to the problem, the total distance traveled by both the ship and the plane is the same.

Let's assume we need to remove x kg of the mixture and replace it with pure sand. \n\nAfter removing x kg of the mixture, we will have 10 - x kg of the mixture. Out of this, 30% will be sand, which means it will have 0.3 x (10 - x) = 3 - 0.3x kg of sand. \n\nWe want the mixture to contain equal quantities of sand and clay, which means it should have 3 - 0.3x kg of clay as well. \n\nSo, out of the remaining 10 - x kg of the mixture, 70% should be clay, which means it should have 0.7 x (10 - x) = 7 - 0.7x kg of clay. \n\nNow, we can set up an equation based on the sum of the sand and clay in the new mixture: \n\n3 - 0.3x + x = 7 - 0.7x \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n1.4x = 4 \n\nx = 4/1.4 = 20/7 \n\nTherefore, we need to remove 20/7 kg of the mixture and replace it with pure sand. \n\nThe answer is (B) 20/7.",

Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, giving him a 2/3 probability of answering correctly.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The probability that Alan answers correctly is 1/5, and the probability that Roger cheats and answers correctly is 2/3. The probability that Peter answers correctly is 5/6. \n\nTo find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, we need to subtract the probability that Roger answers correctly from the total probability of answering correctly, and then subtract the probability that Peter answers correctly from that result. \n\nSo, the total probability of answering correctly is:\n\n1/5 (Alan) + 2/3 (Roger) + 5/6 (Peter) \n\nTo find the probability that Roger answers correctly, we need to know the probability that he cheats, which is 1/3 (since there are three people answering the question and one of them is cheating). So, the probability that Roger answers correctly is:\n\n2/3 (cheating) * 1/2 (probability that the student in front of him answered correctly) = 1/3\n\nNow we can subtract the probability that Roger answers correctly from the total probability of answering correctly:\n\n1/5 + 5/6 - 1/3 = 23/30\n\nFinally, we need to subtract the probability that Peter answers correctly from this result:\n\n23/30 - 5/6 = 1/9\n\nTherefore, the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is 1/9. \n\nThe answer is (B) 1/9.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve it step by step.\n\nLet x be the first of the k consecutive integers. Then the sum of the k integers is:\n\nx + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1)\n\nThis is an arithmetic series with first term x, last term x+k-1, and common difference 1. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by:\n\nsum = (number of terms) * (average of terms)\n\nIn this case, the number of terms is k, and the average of the terms is the average of the first and last terms, which is:\n\naverage = (x + (x+k-1)) / 2 = (2x+k-1) / 2\n\nSo we have:\n\nx + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1) = k * ((2x+k-1) / 2)\n\nWe are given that the sum of the k integers is 51, so we can write:\n\nk * ((2x+k-1) / 2) = 51\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 and simplifying, we get:\n\nk * (2x+k-1) = 102\n\nNow we use the fact that the least integer is -50, so x = -50. Substituting this into the equation above, we get:\n\nk * (-100 + k - 1) = 102\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nk^2 - 99k + 102 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nk = (99 \u00b1 sqrt(99^2 - 4*102)) / 2\n\nk = (99 \u00b1 sqrt(9603)) / 2\n\nk \u2248 1.5 or k \u2248 97.5\n\nSince k must be a positive integer, the only possible value is:\n\nk = 98\n\nTherefore, the sum of 98 consecutive integers starting with -50 is 51.",

Since the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, the volume of silver is also x. Therefore, we can write:\n\nDensity of aluminum x Volume of aluminum x Weight of aluminum = Density of silver x Volume of silver x Weight of silver\n\nSince silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, we can write:\n\nDensity of silver = 2 x Density of aluminum\n\nSubstituting the volumes and densities, we get:\n\n2 x Weight of aluminum x x = Weight of silver x x\n\nWeight of aluminum = (Weight of silver x x) / (2 x x) = Weight of silver / 2\n\nThe weight of the original coin is 30 grams, and the weight of aluminum and silver together is half of that, or 15 grams.
