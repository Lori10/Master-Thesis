            "Question": "Q: One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E be x grams and the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A be y grams. \n\nFrom the problem, we know that 1 gram of the health food contains 9% of x and 8% of y. \n\nTo find out how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we can set up the following system of equations: \n\n0.09x + 0.08y = 1 (since 1 gram of the health food contains 9% of x and 8% of y)\nx + y = ? (we need to find the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins)\n\nWe can solve for x and y by multiplying the first equation by 100 to get rid of the percentages: \n\n9x + 8y = 100\nx + y = ?\n\nWe don't know the exact values of x and y, but we do know that they add up to the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins. Let's call this value z: \n\nx + y = z \n\nNow we can substitute z for x + y in the first equation: \n\n9x + 8y = 100 \n\n9(z - y) + 8y = 100 \n\n9z - y = 100/0.01 = 10000 \n\ny = 9z/8 - 1250 \n\nWe know that y must be greater than or equal to the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, so: \n\ny >= y_min \n\n9z/8 - 1250 >= y_min \n\nz >= 8/9(y_min + 1250) \n\nSimilarly, we can solve for x: \n\nx = 11.11z - 1250 \n\nx >= x_min \n\n11.11z - 1250 >= x_min \n\nz >= (x_min + 1250)/11.11 \n\nFinally, we can find the minimum value of z that satisfies both inequalities: \n\nz >= max(8/9(y_min + 1250), (x_min + 1250)/11.11) \n\nWe don't know the exact values of x_min and y_min, so we can't calculate z exactly. However, we do know that the answer is one of the answer choices given. We can try plugging in each answer choice for z and see which one satisfies both inequalities. \n\nFor example, if we plug in z = 8.5, we get: \n\ny >= y_min \n\ny >= 8.5(9/8) - 1250 \n\ny >= -1240.375 \n\nThis inequality is true for any positive value of y, so z = 8.5 is a valid solution. \n\nSimilarly, if we plug in z = 10.5, we get: \n\ny >= y_min \n\ny >= 10.5(9/8) - 1250 \n\ny >= -1236.375 \n\nThis inequality is also true for any positive value of y, so z = 10.5 is also a valid solution. \n\nWe can continue checking the other answer choices in the same way. However, we notice that the answer choices are all spaced 2 apart, so we can use this fact to eliminate some choices. \n\nFor example, if z = 8.5 is a valid solution, then z = 10.5 is also a valid solution (since it's only 2 more). However, z = 12.5 is 4 more than z = 8.5, so it's unlikely to be a valid solution. \n\nUsing this logic, we can eliminate answer choices (D) and (E). \n\nWe are left with answer choices (A), (B), and (C). We can check each one to see which one satisfies both inequalities. \n\nIf z = 8.5, then: \n\ny >= y_min \n\ny >= 8.5(9/8) - 1250 \n\ny >= -1240.375 \n\nx >= x_min \n\nx >= 11.11(8.5) - 1250 \n\nx >= -1236.5 \n\nBoth inequalities are satisfied, so z = 8.5 is a valid solution. \n\nIf z = 10.5, then: \n\ny >= y_min \n\ny >= 10.5(9/8) - 1250 \n\ny >= -1236.375 \n\nx >= x_min \n\nx >= 11.11(10.5) - 1250 \n\nx >= -1222.95 \n\nBoth inequalities are satisfied, so z = 10.5 is also a valid solution. \n\nIf z = 12.5, then: \n\ny >= y_min \n\ny >= 12.5(9/8) - 1250 \n\ny >= -1232.375 \n\nx >= x_min \n\nx >= 11.11(12.5) -",

Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the number of pens that the company needs to manufacture to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler. Since 10% of the produced pens are defective, the company needs to manufacture more than 7200 pens to compensate for the defective ones. Let's assume that x is the number of pens the company needs to manufacture. Then, the number of non-defective pens is 0.9x, and we know that:\n\n0.9x = 7200\nx = 8000\n\nSo, the company needs to manufacture 8000 pens to deliver 7200 non-defective pens to the wholesaler.\n\nNext, we need to find the cost of manufacturing each pen. Let's assume that the cost of manufacturing each pen is y. Then, the total cost of manufacturing 8000 pens is:\n\n8000y\n\nWe know that the overall profit on all the manufactured pens is 25%, which means that the selling price of each pen is:\n\n1.25y\n\nThe selling price of 7200 pens is:\n\n7200 x 10 = 72000\n\nSo, we can write the equation:\n\n72000 = 1.25y x 7200\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\ny = 6\n\nTherefore, the manufactured cost of each pen is Rs. 6.

Let the number of members in the club be n, and let the age of the oldest member be a.\n\nThen, using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression, we have:\n\nsum = (n/2) * (youngest member + oldest member)\n250 = (n/2) * (7 + a)\n\nWe also know that the age of each member forms an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3 months. Since the youngest member is 7 years old, which is equivalent to 84 months, we can write:\n\n7, 7 3/4, 8 1/2, ..., a\n\nThe nth term of an arithmetic progression can be written as:\n\na + (n-1)*d\n\nwhere d is the common difference. In this case, d = 1/4 and the nth term is a.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nLet the total work be 1 unit. \n\nMr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so his work rate is 1/6. \n\nMr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so his work rate is 1/8. \n\nMr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so his work rate is 1/12. \n\nAfter 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation. In these 8 days, the work completed by the three painters is:\n\nWork completed by Mr. Brown = (1/6) x 8 = 4/3\n\nWork completed by Mr. Black = (1/8) x 8 = 1\n\nWork completed by Mr. Blue = (1/12) x 8 = 2/3\n\nTotal work completed in 8 days = 4/3 + 1 + 2/3 = 4\n\nRemaining work = 1 - 4 = 1/3\n\nNow, Mr. Black works for 6 more days. In these 6 days, the work completed by Mr. Black is:\n\nWork completed by Mr. Black = (1/8) x 6 = 3/4\n\nRemaining work = 1/3 - 3/4 = -1/12\n\nThis negative value means that the work is already completed before Mr. Blue starts working. Therefore, Mr. Blue does not need to work at all.\n\nHence, the answer is 0 days.",

We know that the diver brought a total of x + y coins, but we don't know the exact value of y. However, we can use the fact that the answer should be the minimum number of copper coins that she brought. This means that we want to minimize the value of x. \n\nOne way to do this is to assume that all the coins the diver brought were copper coins, except for one brass coin. This gives us the equation: \n\nx - 1 + 1 = x \n\nwhich simplifies to: \n\nx = (x-1) + 1 \n\nThis means that we can express x as the sum of (x-1) copper coins and 1 brass coin. Substituting this into the first equation, we get: \n\n0.20(x-1) + 0.25(1) = 3.40 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n0.20x - 0.20 + 0.25 = 3.40 \n\n0.20x = 3.35 \n\nx = 16.75 \n\nThis is not a whole number, which means that our assumption was incorrect.

The bill for that month would be : Answer Choices: (A) Rs.1560 (B) Rs.1680 (C) Rs.1840 (D) Rs.1950 (E) Rs.1690",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the fixed cost of the telephone bill. We can do this by using the given information that when 540 calls are made, the bill is Rs. 1800. Let the fixed cost be x and the cost per call be y. Then we have:\n\nx + 540y = 1800\n\nNext, we can use the information that when 620 calls are made, the bill is Rs. 2040 to find the value of y:\n\nx + 620y = 2040\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\n\n80y = 240\n\ny = 3\n\nNow we can substitute this value of y into either of the two equations to find x:\n\nx + 540(3) = 1800\n\nx = 540\n\nSo the fixed cost is Rs. 540 and the cost per call is Rs. 3.\n\nFinally, we can use this information to find the bill for 500 calls:\n\n540 + 500(3) = Rs. 2040\n\nTherefore, the answer is Rs. 2040.",

The total distance covered is 4d (since there are four sides), so we get:\n\nAverage speed = 4d / (25d/2400)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nAverage speed = 384 km/hr\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 384.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "The total time between 5 am and 10:30 am is 5 hours and 30 minutes. \n\nTrain M travels for 4 hours (from 5 am to 9 am) and Train N travels for 3.5 hours (from 7 am to 10:30 am). \n\nLet's assume that the two trains meet x hours after Train N leaves City B. \n\nTherefore, Train M would have traveled for (4 - x) hours before the two trains meet. \n\nSimilarly, Train N would have traveled for (x - 1.5) hours before the two trains meet. \n\nNow, we know that the distance traveled by both trains is the same. \n\nLet's assume that the distance between City A and City B is d. \n\nTherefore, the distance traveled by Train M before the two trains meet is (4 - x) * speed of Train M. \n\nSimilarly, the distance traveled by Train N before the two trains meet is (x - 1.5) * speed of Train N. \n\nSince the two distances are the same, we can equate them: \n\n(4 - x) * speed of Train M = (x - 1.5) * speed of Train N \n\nWe know the speeds of both trains: \n\nSpeed of Train M = d / 4 \n\nSpeed of Train N = d / 3.5 \n\nSubstituting these values in the equation above, we get: \n\n(4 - x) * (d / 4) = (x - 1.5) * (d / 3.5) \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nx = 2.25 \n\nTherefore, the two trains meet 2.25 hours after Train N leaves City B. \n\nTo find the exact time, we add 2.25 hours to 7 am (the time when Train N leaves City B): \n\n7 am + 2.25 hours = 9:15 am \n\nTherefore, the two trains cross each other at 9:15 am. \n\nThe answer is not in the answer choices, so the answer is None of the above.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the minimum number of students. To do this, we assume that there is no overlap between the students studying each subject. This means that we add up the fractions for each subject to get the total fraction of students:\n\n1/16 + 1/10 + 1/8 = 13/80\n\nThis means that 13/80 of the total number of students study one of these three subjects. We know that the total number of students is a 4-digit number, so we need to find the smallest 4-digit number that is greater than or equal to 13/80 of some number. We can do this by dividing 1000 by 13/80:\n\n1000 / (13/80) = 6153.846...\n\nSo the minimum number of students is 6154.\n\nNext, we need to find the maximum number of students. To do this, we assume that all students study all three subjects. This means that we need to find the smallest 4-digit number that is divisible by 1/16, 1/10, and 1/8. We can do this by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators:\n\nLCM(16, 10, 8) = 80\n\nSo the maximum number of students is 80 times the sum of the fractions:\n\n80 * (1/16 + 1/10 + 1/8) = 65\n\nSo the maximum number of students is 6500.\n\nFinally, we can find the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students:\n\n6500 - 6154 = 346\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 7890.",

So, the total marks scored by the failing students would be 55y.\n\nThe overall class average was 76. So, the total marks scored by all the students would be 76 x 100 = 7600.\n\nNow, we can write an equation based on the above information:\n\n83x + 55y = 7600\n\nWe also know that the total number of students is 100.

Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we know that 300 deer were tagged in 2001. In 2002, 20 of the 500 deer caught had tags from the previous year. This means that the percentage of tagged deer in the 500 deer sample is (20/500) * 100 = 4%.\n\nWe can assume that this percentage is representative of the entire deer population in the forest. Let the total deer population be x. Then, the number of tagged deer in the 500 deer sample is 0.04 * 500 = 20.\n\nSince one man and one woman are always selected, we can choose one man from 3 men in 3 ways and one woman from 2 women in 2 ways. The remaining one person can be selected from the remaining 4 people in 4 ways. Therefore, the total number of ways to select 3 men and 2 women such that one man and one woman are always selected is 3 * 2 * 4 = 24.\n\nNow, we know that 300 deer were tagged in 2001 and 20 of them were caught in 2002. This means that there were 280 tagged deer that were not caught in 2002. We also know that there were 20 tagged deer that were caught in 2002 out of a total of 500 deer caught. This means that the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population is:\n\n(280 + 20)/x = 0.04\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n300/x = 0.04\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 7500\n\nTherefore, the total deer population in the forest is 7500.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's break down the problem. \n\nThe terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can get a 4% discount if they pay within 30 days, or they can pay the full amount within n days and get no discount. \n\nTo take advantage of the discount, the merchant needs to pay within 30 days. \n\nThe amount of the discount is 4% of $20,000, which is $800. \n\nSo, the merchant would pay $19,200 if they take advantage of the discount. \n\nNow, let's say the merchant borrows money to pay for the boat. They need to pay back the borrowed amount plus interest. \n\nLet's call the borrowed amount B and the interest rate r. \n\nThe total amount the merchant needs to pay back is B + Br = B(1+r). \n\nIf the merchant can afford to pay back $19,200, then we can set up the equation: \n\nB(1+r) = 19,200 \n\nSolving for B, we get: \n\nB = 19,200 / (1+r) \n\nNow, let's say the merchant needs to pay back the borrowed amount within n days. \n\nThe interest they pay is the difference between the borrowed amount and the amount they need to pay back: \n\nI = B(r/365)(n) \n\nWe want to find the highest interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money. \n\nSo, we need to find the maximum value of r such that: \n\nB + I <= 20,000 \n\nSubstituting B and I, we get: \n\n19,200 / (1+r) + (19,200 / (1+r))(r/365)(n) <= 20,000 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\nr <= (365n - 1600) / (n - 30,000) \n\nPlugging in the given values, we get: \n\nr <= (365n - 1600) / (n - 30) \n\nWe want to find the highest value of r that satisfies this inequality. \n\nWe can try different values of n and see which one gives the highest value of r. \n\nFor example, if we try n = 60, we get: \n\nr <= (365(60) - 1600) / (60 - 30) \n\nr <= 227.67 \n\nSo, the answer is (C) 227.67.",

Since we know that minor arc AB is equal to minor arc BC, we can use the fact that the sum of minor arc AB, minor arc BC, and minor arc AC is equal to 360\u00b0 to get:\n\nx + x + x + 160\u00b0 = 360\u00b0\n3x = 200\u00b0\nx = 66.67\u00b0\n\nSubstituting this value of x into our equation for minor arc AD, we get:\n\nminor arc AD = 210\u00b0 - x\nminor arc AD = 210\u00b0 - 66.67\u00b0\nminor arc AD = 143.33\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the answer is closest to (C) 140\u00b0.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the length of the rectangle is L and the width is W. \n\nWe know that one side (width) is not painted, so its length is 9 feet. \n\nThe sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, which means that: \n\nL + W + L = 37 \n\n2L + W = 37 \n\nWe can rearrange this equation to express W in terms of L: \n\nW = 37 - 2L \n\nNow we can substitute this expression for W into the formula for the area of a rectangle: \n\nA = LW \n\nA = L(37 - 2L) \n\nA = 37L - 2L^2 \n\nTo find the maximum area, we need to find the value of L that maximizes this expression.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find out how much orange juice is in one gallon of the soft drink. Since one gallon of the soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, we can calculate that 0.4 x 1 = 0.4 gallons of orange juice are in one gallon of the soft drink.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much soft drink we need to make in order to get one additional gallon of orange juice. Since we want the orange juice to be 60% of the soft drink, we know that 0.6 x (1 + additional gallons) = additional gallons of orange juice. Simplifying this equation, we get 0.6 + 0.6 x additional gallons = additional gallons of orange juice. Subtracting 0.6 from both sides, we get 0.6 x additional gallons = additional gallons of orange juice - 0.6.\n\nFinally, we can substitute the value we found for the amount of orange juice in one gallon of the soft drink into the equation above and solve for additional gallons. This gives us:\n\n0.6 x additional gallons = 1 - 0.4\n0.6 x additional gallons = 0.6\nadditional gallons = 1\n\nTherefore, we need to mix in one additional gallon of orange juice to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the 5-digit number be ABCDE. \n\nAccording to the problem, if we add a 1 after it, we get the number ABCDE1, which is three times as large as the number if we add a 1 before it, which would be 1ABCDE. \n\nSo we can set up the equation: \n\nABCDE1 = 3(1ABCDE)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nABCDE1 = 300000 + 3(ABCDE)\n\nNow we can see that the last digit of the number must be 7, because 3 times any number ending in 1 will end in 3. \n\nSo we can rewrite the equation as: \n\nABCDE1 = 300000 + 3(ABCDE) + 6\n\nSimplifying further: \n\nABCDE1 = 3(ABCDE + 200002)\n\nNow we can see that ABCDE + 200002 must be divisible by 3, because otherwise the left side of the equation would not be an integer. \n\nThe only 5-digit number that satisfies this condition is 42857. \n\nSo the answer is (A) 42857.",

Then, the length of the room is 10x/(2x) = 5 and the breadth is (2*5x - 2*2x)/2 = 6x.\n\nThe total area of the four walls is (2x*5 + 2x*6x) = 22x^2. The area of the doors and windows is given as 15 sq.m. So, the area to be papered is (22x^2 - 15).\n\nThe length of the paper required is the perimeter of the room, which is (2*5x + 2*6x) = 22x. Since the paper is 50 cm wide, the length of paper required is (22x/0.5) = 44x.\n\nThe cost of papering is given as Rs. 260.

If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number. Answer Choices: (A) 368 (B) 377 (C) 288 (D) 997 (E) 112",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we know that the sum of the digits is 17. This means that the hundreds digit plus the tens digit plus the units digit equals 17. We can write this as:\n\nh + t + u = 17\n\nNext, we know that the sum of the squares of the digits is 109. This means that:\n\nh^2 + t^2 + u^2 = 109\n\nWe can use these two equations to solve for the three digits. One way to do this is to use trial and error. We can start by guessing values for the hundreds digit, since it is the largest digit. Let's try h = 9. Then we have:\n\n9 + t + u = 17\nt + u = 8\n\nAnd:\n\n9^2 + t^2 + u^2 = 109\n81 + t^2 + u^2 = 109\nt^2 + u^2 = 28\n\nNow we can use trial and error to find values of t and u that satisfy both equations. One way to do this is to list out all the possible values of t and u that add up to 8, and then check which ones also satisfy t^2 + u^2 = 28. We can start with t = 1 and u = 7:\n\nt = 1, u = 7\n1^2 + 7^2 = 50 (not equal to 28)\n\nNext, we can try t = 2 and u = 6:\n\nt = 2, u = 6\n2^2 + 6^2 = 40 (not equal to 28)\n\nWe can keep trying different values of t and u until we find a pair that works. Alternatively, we can use the fact that t and u must be integers between 0 and 9, inclusive, and use a computer program or calculator to check all possible pairs. After trying a few pairs, we find that t = 3 and u = 5 works:\n\nt = 3, u = 5\n3^2 + 5^2 = 34 (not equal to 28)\n\nNow we can use these values of h, t, and u to find the original number. The number is 900 + 30t + u. In this case, the number is 935. We can check that this works by subtracting 495 from 935 to get 440, which is the reverse of 935.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we know that the store sold 80% of its inventory, so it sold 0.8 x 600 = 480 golf balls.\nWe also know that the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and sold all of its white golf balls. This means that the number of white golf balls sold is equal to the number of white golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day.\nLet's say the store had y yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day. Then, it also had 600 - y white golf balls at the beginning of the day.\nSince the store sold all of its white golf balls, we know that 600 - y - 480 = 0, which means that y = 120.\nTherefore, the store had 120 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nLet's assume that there are 100 students in Daifu university. \n\nAccording to the problem, 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. So, the number of students who are members of both a chess club and a swim team is:\n\n24% of 100 = 24 students\n\nNow, let's find out the number of students who are only members of the swim team. \n\nAccording to the problem, 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club. So, the number of students who are only members of the swim team is:\n\n20% of (100 - 24) = 15.2 students (rounded to the nearest whole number)\n\nTherefore, the total number of students who are members of the swim team (including those who are members of both a chess club and a swim team) is:\n\n24 + 15.2 = 39.2 students (rounded to the nearest whole number)\n\nFinally, the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team is:\n\n39.2% of 100 = 39.2%\n\nTherefore, the answer is not one of the given answer choices.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The liquid passes through the drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. \n\nSo, in one second, the rate at which the liquid passes through the drain is w/25 gallons. \n\nTo find how many minutes it will take y gallons to pass through the drain, we need to find the time it takes to pass one gallon and then multiply it by y. \n\nThe time it takes to pass one gallon is the reciprocal of the rate at which one gallon passes through the drain. \n\nThe rate at which one gallon passes through the drain is (w/25)/1 = w/25 gallons per second. \n\nSo, the time it takes to pass one gallon is 1/(w/25) = 25/w seconds. \n\nTo convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60. \n\nSo, the time it takes to pass one gallon in minutes is (25/w)/60 = 5/(12w) minutes. \n\nTherefore, the time it takes y gallons to pass through the drain is y times the time it takes to pass one gallon, which is y * 5/(12w) = 5xy/(12w) minutes. \n\nHence, the answer is (C) 5xy/(12w).",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nThe bond pays an annual interest rate of 12%, which means that the bond earns 6% interest every six months. \n\nThe bond is compounded every six months, so we need to find the interest earned for each six-month period. \n\nFor the first six months, the bond earns 6% interest on the principal amount of $5,000, which is $300. \n\nFor the second six months, the bond earns 6% interest on the principal amount of $5,300 (which is the original $5,000 plus the $300 earned in the first six months), which is $318. \n\nFor the third six months, the bond earns 6% interest on the principal amount of $5,618 (which is the original $5,000 plus the $300 earned in the first six months plus the $318 earned in the second six months), which is $337.08. \n\nFor the fourth six months, the bond earns 6% interest on the principal amount of $5,955.08 (which is the original $5,000 plus the $300 earned in the first six months plus the $318 earned in the second six months plus the $337.08 earned in the third six months), which is $357.30. \n\nFor the fifth six months, the bond earns 6% interest on the principal amount of $6,312.38 (which is the original $5,000 plus the $300 earned in the first six months plus the $318 earned in the second six months plus the $337.08 earned in the third six months plus the $357.30 earned in the fourth six months), which is $378.74. \n\nFor the final six months, the bond earns 6% interest on the principal amount of $6,691.12 (which is the original $5,000 plus the $300 earned in the first six months plus the $318 earned in the second six months plus the $337.08 earned in the third six months plus the $357.30 earned in the fourth six months plus the $378.74 earned in the fifth six months), which is $400.27. \n\nTherefore, the total interest earned on the bond at maturity is $300 + $318 + $337.08 + $357.30 + $378.74 + $400.27 = $2091.39. \n\nSo the answer is not one of the given options.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we can use the fact that the sum of their ages is 100 to write an equation:\n\nJoe's age + Joe's sister's age + Joe's father's age = 100\n\nNext, we can use the information that \"When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now\" to write another equation. Let's use \"x\" to represent the current age of Joe's sister:\n\nJoe's age + x + Joe's age = 2(x)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2Joe's age + x = 2x\n\nWe can simplify this further by using the fact that \"Joe's age + Joe's sister's age + Joe's father's age = 100\" to substitute for \"Joe's age + x\" in the equation above:\n\n100 - Joe's father's age = 2x\n\nNow we have an equation that relates Joe's father's age to Joe's sister's age. We can use this to write another equation based on the fact that \"When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father\". Let's use \"y\" to represent the age difference between Joe's sister and Joe's father when Joe is as old as his father:\n\nJoe's age + y = 2(x - y)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nJoe's age + y = 2x - 2y\n\nWe can simplify this further by using the fact that \"Joe's age + Joe's sister's age + Joe's father's age = 100\" to substitute for \"Joe's age + x\" and \"100 - Joe's father's age\" in the equation above:\n\n100 - x - y = 2x - 2y\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n3x - y = 100\n\nNow we have two equations that relate Joe's father's age to Joe's sister's age:\n\n100 - Joe's father's age = 2x\n\n3x - y = 100\n\nWe can solve this system of equations by substituting the first equation into the second equation:\n\n3(100 - Joe's father's age)/2 - y = 100\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n150 - 3Joe's father's age - 2y = 200\n\n3Joe's father's age + 2y = -50\n\nNow we have two equations that relate Joe's father's age to Joe's sister's age:\n\n100 - Joe's father's age = 2x\n\n3Joe's father's age + 2y = -50\n\nWe can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 3 and adding it to the second equation:\n\n300 - 3Joe's father's age + 3Joe's father's age + 2y = -50 + 300\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2y = 250\n\ny = 125\n\nNow we can use the equation \"3x - y = 100\" to solve for x:\n\n3x - 125 = 100\n\n3x = 225\n\nx = 75\n\nFinally, we can use the equation \"100 - Joe's father's age = 2x\" to solve for Joe's father's age:\n\n100 - Joe's father's age = 2(75)\n\n100 - Joe's father's age = 150\n\nJoe's father's age = 50\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 50.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nLet's start by finding the combined rate of Printer A and Printer B. Since each printer can print 1/2 page per second, the combined rate is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 page per second.\n\nNow, we can use the formula:\n\ntime = amount of work / rate\n\nWe want to print 100 pages, so the amount of work is 100 pages. The combined rate is 1 page per second. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ntime = 100 / 1 = 100 seconds\n\nTherefore, it will take both printers working together 100 seconds to print 100 pages.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the initial number of boys and girls in the group. We know that the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, so we can represent the number of boys as 4x and the number of girls as 3x.\n\nWe are also given that there were initially 64 boys and 40 girls in the group. So we can set up the equation:\n\n4x = 64\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 16\n\nSo the initial number of boys was 4x = 4(16) = 64, and the initial number of girls was 3x = 3(16) = 48.\n\nNow we are told that the same number of boys and girls joined the group. Let's call this number y. So the new number of boys in the group is 64 + y, and the new number of girls is 48 + y.\n\nWe can set up another equation based on the fact that the ratio of boys to girls is still 4:3:\n\n(64 + y)/(48 + y) = 4/3\n\nCross-multiplying and simplifying, we get:\n\n192 + 3y = 256 + 4y\n\ny = 64\n\nSo the number of boys and girls that joined the group is 64 each. Therefore, the new total number of members in the group is:\n\n64 boys + 64 girls + 64 initial boys + 40 initial girls = 232\n\nTherefore, the answer is not one of the given options.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the amount of zinc and copper in 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y.\n\nFor alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. This means that out of every 5 parts of the alloy, 2 parts are zinc and 3 parts are copper. So, in 40 grams of alloy X, we have:\n\nZinc = (2/5) * 40 = 16 grams\nCopper = (3/5) * 40 = 24 grams\n\nFor alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which does not simplify. So, in 60 grams of alloy Y, we have:\n\nZinc = (7/18) * 60 = 23.33 grams (rounded to 2 decimal places)\nCopper = (11/18) * 60 = 36.67 grams (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n\nNow, we can find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z:\n\nZinc = 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams (rounded to 2 decimal places)\nCopper = 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n\nFinally, we can simplify the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z:\n\nZinc : Copper = 39.33 : 60.67\n              = 59 : 91 (rounded to the nearest whole number)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 59:91.",

The time taken for this would be (x-20)/s. But since you also stop for 10 minutes, the total time taken would be (x-20)/s + 10. On the other hand, if you take the elevator, the time taken would be x/s. \n\nEquation 2: (x-10)/s + 20 = (x/s) \n\nExplanation: If you walk 10 steps and stop, then you still have to cover (x-10) steps to reach the bottom.
