Answer Choices: (A) 1 : 2 : 3 (B) 3 : 2 : 1 (C) 4 : 2 : 3 (D) 2 : 4 : 7 (E) none of these\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can simplify the second ratio by cross-multiplying to get z(y + x) = (y)(y + x), which simplifies to y^2 = zx. Next, we can substitute this expression for y^2 into the first ratio to get y/(x - z) = (y + x)/z = x/zx^(1/2). Simplifying this expression, we get y = x^(3/2)/(x - z) and z = x^(1/2)/(x - z). Now, we can substitute these expressions for y and z into the ratio y^2 : x : z to get x^(3/2)/(x - z)^2 : x : x^(1/2)/(x - z). Simplifying this expression, we get x^(5/2) : x(x - z)^2 : x^(3/2)(x - z). Cancelling out an x from each term, we get x^(3/2) : (x - z)^2 : x^(1/2). Now, we can substitute the expression for z from earlier (z = x^(1/2)/(x - z)) into this ratio to get x^(3/2) : (x - x^(1/2))^2 : x^(1/2). Simplifying this expression, we get x^(3/2) : (x^2 - 2x^(3/2) + x) : x^(1/2). Finally, we can simplify the middle term by expanding the square and combining like terms to get x^(3/2) : (x^2 - 2x^(3/2) + x) : x^(1/2) = x^(3/2) : (x^2 - x^(3/2)) : x^(1/2) = x^(1/2) : (x - 1) : 1. Therefore, the answer is (E) none of these, since none of the given answer choices match the ratio x^(1/2) : (x - 1) : 1. The answer is E.\n\nQ: When sold at a 60% discount, a sweater nets the merchant a 20% profit on the wholesale cost at which he initially purchased the item. By what % is the sweater marked up from wholesale at its normal retail price? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 66.67% (D) 80% (E) 100%\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that the wholesale cost of the sweater is $100. If the merchant sells the sweater at a 60% discount, he sells it for 40% of the original price, which is $40. Now, we know that the merchant makes a 20% profit on the wholesale cost at which he initially purchased the item. So, the cost price for the merchant is $100, and he makes a profit of 20%, which is $20. Therefore, the selling price for the merchant is $120. We can now calculate the markup percentage from the wholesale price to the normal retail price. Markup percentage = (Selling price - Wholesale price) / Wholesale price x 100% Markup percentage = ($120 - $100) / $100 x 100% Markup percentage = 20% Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 20%. The answer is A.\n\nQ: Three friends-whose walking rates are 1 ft./sec., 3ft./sec.,and 6ft./sec. start together walking in the same direction around a circular track that is 420 feet in circumference.After how many minutes are the three of them together again? Answer Choices: (A) 5 mins (B) 10 mins (C) 15 mins (D) 3 mins (E) 7 mins\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for each friend to complete one full lap around the track. We can use the formula: time = distance / rate For the friend with a walking rate of 1 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 1 ft./sec. = 420 sec. For the friend with a walking rate of 3 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 3 ft./sec. = 140 sec. For the friend with a walking rate of 6 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 6 ft./sec. = 70 sec. Now we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these three times, which will give us the time it takes for all three friends to be together again. The LCM of 420 sec., 140 sec., and 70 sec. is 420 sec. Converting 420 sec. to minutes, we get: 420 sec. / 60 sec./min. = 7 min. Therefore, the answer is (E) 7 mins. The answer is E.\n\nQ: A jar full of whisky contains 40% alcohol. A part of this whisky is replaced by another containg 19% alcohol and now the percentage of alcohol was found to be 22%. What quantity of whisky is replaced ? Answer Choices: (A) 1/3 (B) 2/3 (C) 2/5 (D) 3/5 (E) 4/5\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the jar initially contains 100 units of whisky. Out of these 100 units, 40 units are alcohol. Let's say x units of whisky are replaced with the new whisky containing 19% alcohol. So, the amount of alcohol in the new mixture will be: 40 - 0.4x (alcohol in the original mixture) + 0.19x (alcohol in the new mixture) The total amount of whisky in the new mixture will be: 100 - x (original amount) + x (new amount) Now, we are given that the percentage of alcohol in the new mixture is 22%. So, we can set up the equation: (40 - 0.4x + 0.19x)/(100) = 0.22 Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 2/5 Therefore, 2/5 of the original amount of whisky is replaced with the new whisky containing 19% alcohol. So, the answer is (C) 2/5. The answer is C.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step."

Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht. If he can clean the yacht in 12 hours, then he can clean 1/12 of the yacht in one hour.

Therefore, the total work completed in the first 8 days is: 4/3 + 3/4 = 7/3. \n\nThis means that there is still 1 - 7/3 = 2/3 of the work left to be done. Let's assume that Mr. Blue takes x days to complete the remaining work. Then, his rate of work is 1/x. We know that the combined rate of work is 1/4, so we can set up the equation: \n\n1/4 = (2/3) / 8 + (1/x) / 6 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n1/x = 1/12 \n\nTherefore, Mr. Blue can complete the remaining work in 12 days. \n\nSo, the answer is (E) 12.",

The value of each copper coin is less than the value of each brass coin, so the diver would want to bring the minimum number of copper coins possible. Therefore, we want to minimize the value of x subject to the constraint in equation 1. \n\nTo minimize x, we can start by assuming that the diver brought only brass coins (y coins). In this case, the total amount earned would be 25y cents. We can then subtract this amount from the total amount earned in equation 1 to get the amount earned from copper coins: \n\n20x = 340 - 25y \n\nWe want to minimize x, so we want to maximize y.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can solve this problem by using combinations and counting the number of ways to select 3 candy bars that cost more than $4. We can start by considering the different cases based on the cost of the candy bars:\n\nCase 1: Select 3 candy bars that cost $2 each\nThere are 4 candy bars that cost $2 each, so the number of ways to select 3 of them is C(4,3) = 4.\n\nCase 2: Select 2 candy bars that cost $2 each and 1 candy bar that costs $1\nThere are 4 candy bars that cost $2 each and 4 candy bars that cost $1 each. The number of ways to select 2 of the $2 candy bars is C(4,2) = 6, and the number of ways to select 1 of the $1 candy bars is C(4,1) = 4. So, the total number of ways to select 2 $2 candy bars and 1 $1 candy bar is 6 x 4 = 24.\n\nCase 3: Select 1 candy bar that costs $2, 1 candy bar that costs $1, and 1 candy bar that costs 50 cents\nThere are 4 candy bars that cost $2 each, 4 candy bars that cost $1 each, and 3 candy bars that cost 50 cents each.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Since each student selected 2 songs, there were a total of 2 x 5 = 10 selections made by the students for each song. Let's assume that there were n students surveyed. Then, the total number of selections made by the students is 10n. However, each song was selected 5 times, so the total number of selections made by the students is also 5 x 10 = 50. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 10n = 50 Solving for n, we get: n = 5 Therefore, 5 students were surveyed. However, this answer does not make sense since each student selected 2 songs, and there were only 10 songs in total. Therefore, we made an error in our calculation. Let's try again. If each song was selected 5 times, and each student selected 2 songs, then there were a total of 5/2 = 2.5 students who selected each song. However, since we cannot have half a student, we know that either 2 or 3 students selected each song. Let's assume that 2 students selected each song. Then, the total number of students surveyed would be: 10 x 2 = 20 However, this answer does not make sense since we assumed that 2 students selected each song, and there were only 10 songs in total.

Let's say that the helpers make y large cakes and z small cakes. We can set up the following system of equations:\n\n2xy + 35xz = 20 (since 2 large cakes are made per helper per hour)\n35xy + z = 700 (since 35 small cakes are made per helper per hour)\n\nWe also know that the kitchen is available for 3 hours, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n2xy + 35xz + 35xy + 3z = 20x + 105z = 3(20) + 700 = 760\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n20x + 105z = 760\n\nWe can now use trial and error to find the values of x and z that satisfy this equation. We can start by assuming that x = 8 (since each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour, we need at least 10 helpers to make 20 large cakes in 3 hours). Substituting x = 8 into the equation, we get:\n\n20(8) + 105z = 760\n160 + 105z = 760\n105z = 600\nz = 40/7\n\nSince z is not an integer, we need to try a different value of x. We can try x = 10 (since each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour, we need at least 20 helpers to make 700 small cakes in 3 hours). Substituting x = 10 into the equation, we get:\n\n20(10) + 105z = 760\n200 + 105z = 760\n105z = 560\nz = 16/3\n\nAgain, z is not an integer, so we need to try a different value of x. We can try x = 12. Substituting x = 12 into the equation, we get:\n\n20(12) + 105z = 760\n240 + 105z = 760\n105z = 520\nz = 104/21\n\nOnce again, z is not an integer. We can continue this process until we find a value of x that gives us an integer value of z. We can also notice that the value of z is increasing as x increases, so we can try x = 15. Substituting x = 15 into the equation, we get:\n\n20(15) + 105z = 760\n300 + 105z = 760\n105z = 460\nz = 92/21\n\nFinally, we have found an integer value of z.

We also know that the total profit is $3,000. So, we can set up the equation: $20 profit per bag x number of bags = $3,000 Solving for the number of bags, we get: number of bags = $3,000 / $20 per bag = 150 bags Therefore, the grocer sold 150 bags of flour.

We can do this by finding the value of x that maximizes the total number of trousers. To do this, we can take the derivative of the total number of trousers with respect to x and set it equal to zero: d/dx (810 - 0.7x)/70 = 0 Simplifying this equation, we get: 11 = x/10 Solving for x, we get x = 110.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the total number of people who took the survey is x. Then, we know that 60% of them were women, which means that 40% of them were men. So, the number of men who took the survey is 0.4x. We also know that 75% of the men preferred red cars over green cars. So, the number of men who preferred red cars is 0.75(0.4x) = 0.3x. We are given that 10 men liked green cars more than red. So, the number of men who preferred green cars is 0.4x - 0.3x - 10 = 0.1x - 10. We can now set up an equation based on the total number of people who preferred red cars: 0.6x + 0.3x = 0.9x = number of people who preferred red cars We can also set up an equation based on the number of men who preferred red cars and the number of men who preferred green cars: 0.3x = 0.1x - 10 + number of women who preferred red cars + number of women who preferred green cars We know that the total number of women who took the survey is 0.6x, so the number of women who preferred red cars is 0.6x - number of men who preferred red cars. Similarly, the number of women who preferred green cars is 0.4x - (0.1x - 10) = 0.3x + 10. Substituting these expressions into the equation, we get: 0.3x = 0.1x - 10 + 0.6x - 0.3x - 10 + 0.3x + 10 Solving for x, we get x = 200.

Let's say the speed of train M is y km/hour and the speed of train N is z km/hour. Then we can set up the equation: x = 4y (distance travelled by train M) + 3.5z (distance travelled by train N) We also know that the two trains are travelling towards each other, so their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Therefore, we can set up another equation: x = (y + z)t (distance travelled by the two trains in time t) Now we can equate the two expressions for x: 4y + 3.5z = (y + z)t Simplifying this equation, we get: t = 7.5z / (y + z) Now we can substitute this expression for t into either of the two equations for x to get: x = 4y + 3.5z = (y + z)(7.5z / (y + z)) = 7.5z Therefore, the two trains meet at a distance of 7.5z km from City A. Now we can use the equation: time = distance / speed to find the time at which the two trains meet.

We are given that a bag of the mixture contains 3 pounds of rice. We can use this information to find the total number of parts in the mixture. Since the ratio of rice to the total mixture is 2:10 (2 + 3 + 5), we can set up the proportion: 2/10 = 3 pounds/x pounds, where x is the total weight of the mixture. Solving for x, we get: x = 15 pounds. Now that we know the total weight of the mixture, we can use the ratio of corn to the total mixture to find the amount of corn in the bag. Since the ratio of corn to the total mixture is 5:10, we can set up the proportion: 5/10 = y pounds/15 pounds, where y is the amount of corn in the bag. Solving for y, we get: y = 7.5 pounds.

We know that 20 deer in the sample were tagged in 2001, so the percentage of tagged deer in the sample is: (20/500) x 100% = 4%. We are told that this percentage is representative of the percentage of tagged deer in the entire forest, so we can set up the equation: (number of tagged deer in the forest) / (total deer population in the forest) x 100% = 4% We know that 300 deer were tagged in 2001, so the number of tagged deer in the forest is 300 + (number of deer tagged in 2002). Let's say that x deer were tagged in 2002. We can now set up another equation based on the information given: (x/500) x 100% = 4% Solving for x, we get: x = 20 x 500 / 4 = 2500 Therefore, the total number of tagged deer in the forest is 300 + 2500 = 2800. We can now use this information to find the total deer population in the forest. We know that the percentage of tagged deer in the forest is: (2800 / total deer population) x 100% We also know that this percentage is equal to 4%, so we can set up the equation: (2800 / total deer population) x 100% = 4% Solving for total deer population, we get: total deer population = 2800 / 0.04 = 70000 Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 70000.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the distance between X and Y is d km. Let's also assume that they meet for the second time after t hours. When they meet for the first time, they have covered a total distance of d km. Let's say Allen has covered x km and Bob has covered (d - x) km. Using the formula distance = speed x time, we can set up the equation: x/54 = (d - x)/78 Solving for x, we get: x = 18d/31 So, when they meet for the first time, Allen has covered 18d/31 km and Bob has covered 13d/31 km. When Allen changes his direction and starts moving towards X, he covers the same distance again (18d/31 km) before they meet for the second time. At this point, Bob has covered a total distance of (13d/31 + 48) km. Using the formula distance = speed x time, we can set up the equation: 18d/31 = (13d/31 + 48)/78 Solving for d, we get: d = 126 km Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 126 km.

She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.) Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20",
            "Pred_Rationale": "If Amy uses a single letter to represent each type of book, she would need at least 10 letters. However, if she uses pairs of two different letters, she can create more unique combinations with fewer letters. The number of unique combinations of pairs of letters is given by the formula n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of distinct letters. So, if Amy uses two distinct letters to represent each type of book, she would need at least 6 letters (since 6 is the smallest integer such that n(n-1)/2 >= 10). However, we can do better by using some of the same letters in different pairs. For example, we can use the pairs AB, AC, AD, AE, AF, AG, AH, AI, BJ, and CK to represent the 10 types of books, using only 5 distinct letters (A, B, C, J, and K). Therefore, the smallest number of letters Amy will need is (C) 5. The answer is C.",

In this case, we have:\n\nL(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] \u2264 x + y + [x + y]\nR(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] \u2264 2x + 2y\n\nSince x and y are positive, we have [x + y] < 1, so L(x,y) < x + y + 1. Also, we have [2x] \u2264 2x and [2y] \u2264 2y, so R(x,y) \u2264 2x + 2y. Therefore, we have:\n\nL(x,y) < x + y + 1 \u2264 2x + 2y \u2264 R(x,y)\n\nThis shows that option (D) is not possible. \n\nSince options (C) and (D) are not possible, the only remaining options are (A), (B), and (E). To see that option (A) is possible, we can take x = y = 1/4. In this case, we have:\n\nL(x,y) = [1/4] + [1/4] + [1/2] = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\nR(x,y) = [1/2] + [1/2] = 0 + 0 = 0\n\nTherefore, L(x,y) = R(x,y). To see that option (B) is possible, we can take x = 1/4 and y = 3/4. In this case, we have:\n\nL(x,y) = [1/4] + [3/4] + [1] = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\nR(x,y) = [1/2] + [3/2] = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nTherefore, L(x,y) \u2260 R(x,y). \n\nThus, the answer is (B) L(x,y) \u2260 R(x,y).

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the three-digit number be represented by the digits $a$, $b$, and $c$, where $a$ is the hundreds digit, $b$ is the tens digit, and $c$ is the units digit. We are given that $a+b+c=17$ and $a^2+b^2+c^2=109$. We want to find the number that satisfies the condition that when we subtract 495 from it, we get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. \n\nLet's first use the information about the sum of the digits. We know that $a+b+c=17$, so we can try different combinations of $a$, $b$, and $c$ that add up to 17. We quickly find that $a=8$, $b=5$, and $c=4$ is the only combination that works. \n\nNow we can use the information about the sum of the squares of the digits. We know that $a^2+b^2+c^2=109$, so we can substitute in the values we found for $a$, $b$, and $c$ to get $8^2+5^2+4^2=109$. This is true, so we know that our values for $a$, $b$, and $c$ are correct. \n\nFinally, we need to find the number that satisfies the condition that when we subtract 495 from it, we get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. The number we are looking for is $abc$, which is $854$. When we subtract 495 from this number, we get $854-495=359$. This number has the same digits as $854$, but in reverse order. \n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 368}$.",

Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the pool has a capacity of 1 unit (it doesn't matter what the actual capacity is, as long as we are consistent with our units). Hose A can fill the pool alone in 8 hours, so its filling rate is 1/8 units per hour. Let's say that hose B's filling rate is x units per hour. \n\nIn the first 2 hours, hose A fills 2/8 = 1/4 of the pool. This means that there is 3/4 of the pool left to fill. \n\nWorking together, hoses A and B can fill the remaining 3/4 of the pool in 3 hours. We can set up the equation: \n\n(1/8 + x) * 3 = 3/4 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n1/8 + x = 1/16 \n\nx = 1/16 - 1/8 \n\nx = 1/16 - 2/16 \n\nx = -1/16 \n\nThis is a problem, because it means that hose B has a negative filling rate, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or in our calculations. \n\nOne possibility is that the problem meant to say that hose A filled the pool alone for the first 3 hours, instead of 2 hours. In that case, the amount of water that hose A fills is 3/8, and the amount of water that hoses A and B fill together is 5/8. We can set up the equation: \n\n(1/8 + x) * 3 = 5/8 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n1/8 + x = 5/24 \n\nx = 5/24 - 1/8 \n\nx = 5/24 - 3/24 \n\nx = 2/24 \n\nx = 1/12 \n\nThis means that hose B's filling rate is 1/12 units per hour. Therefore, it would take hose B, working alone, 12 hours to fill the entire pool. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 12.",

Now we can substitute this into either equation to solve for x and y:\n\nx + 2y = 150\nx + 2x = 150\n3x = 150\nx = 50\n\nSo, a soda costs 50 cents and an energy bar also costs 50 cents. Now we can calculate the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars:\n\n6x + 7y = 6(50) + 7(50) = 600 + 350 = 950\n\nTherefore, the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 950 cents, which is not one of the answer choices. However, we can notice that the cost of one soda and one energy bar is 100 cents, so the cost of six sodas and six energy bars is 1200 cents. Adding one more energy bar, we get:\n\n6x + 7y = 6(50) + 7(50) + 50 = 1000 + 50 = 1050\n\nTherefore, the closest answer choice is (E) 900, which is 150 cents less than our answer.

Therefore, we can set up the equation: \n\n0.8x = 1.2(1200) \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nx = 1800 \n\nTherefore, Karan should mark the sewing machine at Rs. 1800 to make a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount. \n\nHowever, the question asks for the price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine so that he makes a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount. So, we need to calculate the cost price that will give us a profit of 20% after offering a 20% discount. \n\nLet's assume that Karan marks the sewing machine at y rupees. Karan wants to make a 20% profit on the cost price, which means he wants to sell the sewing machine for 1.2 times the cost price. So, the selling price of the sewing machine after the 20% discount will be 0.8 times the marked price. Therefore, we can set up the equation: \n\n0.8y = 1.2(cost price) \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\ncost price = 2/3y \n\nKaran wants to make a 20% profit on the cost price, which means he wants to sell the sewing machine for 1.2 times the cost price. Therefore, we can set up the equation: \n\n1.2(2/3y) = y \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\ny = 1800 \n\nTherefore, Karan should mark the sewing machine at Rs. 1800 to make a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount. \n\nThe answer is (E) 1,800.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to calculate how many quarter-miles we can travel for $5.00 (which is $8.50 - $3.50, the cost of the first quarter-mile). We can set up the equation: 0.10x + 3.50 = 5.00 where x is the number of quarter-miles we can travel for $5.00. Solving for x, we get: x = 15. Therefore, we can travel 15 quarter-miles for $5.00. Now, we need to calculate how many quarter-miles we can travel for the remaining $3.50. We can set up the equation: 0.10x = 3.50 where x is the number of quarter-miles we can travel for $3.50. Solving for x, we get: x = 35. Therefore, we can travel 35 quarter-miles for $3.50. Adding the number of quarter-miles we can travel for $5.00 and $3.50, we get: 15 + 35 = 50 quarter-miles. Converting this to miles, we get: 50 quarter-miles x 0.25 miles/quarter-mile = 12.5 miles. Therefore, the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50 is 12.5 miles. However, we need to subtract the initial quarter-mile that costs $3.50, so the actual maximum distance we can travel is 12.5 - 0.25 = 12.25 miles. Therefore, the closest answer choice is (B) 12.75 miles. The answer is B.",

Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the distance between A and B is d miles. We know that Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, so the time it took him to travel from A to B is d/70 hours. When he turned around and drove back to A at a constant speed of 90 mph, the time it took him to travel from B to A is also d/90 hours. We are given that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. This means that he had already traveled a distance of d - 70 miles from A towards B, and he had 3 more hours to travel the remaining distance of 70 miles to reach B. We can use the formula: distance = rate x time to find the total time it took him to travel from A to B and back to A. The total time is: d/70 + d/90 + 3 hours We can simplify this equation by finding a common denominator: (9d + 7d)/630 + (7d + 6d)/630 + 3 = 22d/630 + 3 = (22d + 189)/630 We know that this total time is 3 hours less than the total time it would take him to travel the distance d at an average speed of (2d)/(d/70 + d/90) = 2520d/160 = 15.75d mph. The total time at this speed would be: d/15.75 - 3 hours We can set up the equation: (22d + 189)/630 = d/15.75 - 3 Solving for d, we get: d = 270 Therefore, the distance between A and B is 270 miles.

We know that the total weight of the mixture is 10 kg, so we can set up the equation: x + y = 10 We also know that the initial mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay, so we can set up another equation based on the percentages: x/(x + y) = 0.3 (amount of sand in the initial mixture) y/(x + y) = 0.7 (amount of clay in the initial mixture) We want to remove some of the mixture and replace it with pure sand so that the final mixture contains equal quantities of sand and clay.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can use the formula for compound interest to solve this problem: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is the principal (the amount originally invested), r is the annual interest rate (as a decimal), n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years.\n\nIn this case, we know that the final amount is $54,080, the annual interest rate is 8%, and the interest is compounded semi-annually (which means n = 2). We want to find the principal, P.\n\nWe can start by dividing both sides of the formula by (1 + r/n)^(nt):\n\nP = A / (1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nP = $54,080 / (1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nP = $50,000\n\nTherefore, Charles originally invested $50,000.

            "Question": "Q: X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ? Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the amount of zinc and copper in 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y. For alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. So, out of 40 grams of alloy X, 2/5 x 40 = 16 grams is zinc and 3/5 x 40 = 24 grams is copper. For alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which does not simplify. So, out of 60 grams of alloy Y, 7/18 x 60 = 23.33 grams is zinc and 11/18 x 60 = 36.67 grams is copper (rounded to two decimal places). Now, we can add the amounts of zinc and copper in the two alloys to get the amounts in alloy Z. The total amount of zinc in alloy Z is 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams. The total amount of copper in alloy Z is 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams. Therefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 39.33:60.67, which simplifies to 59:91. Therefore, the answer is (D) 59:91.

Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the wholesale cost of the appliance is $100. Then, the original retail price of the appliance is 60% more than the wholesale cost, which is $160. However, the appliance is sold for 20% less than the original retail price, which is 0.8 x $160 = $128. \n\nNow, we need to find the percentage increase from the wholesale cost to the selling price. The percentage increase is given by:\n\n((Selling price - Wholesale cost) / Wholesale cost) x 100%\n\nSubstituting the values we have, we get:\n\n(($128 - $100) / $100) x 100% = 28%\n\nTherefore, the appliance was sold for 28% more than its wholesale cost.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the breadth of the rectangular piece is x meters. Then, the length of the rectangular piece is (4x + 1) meters. We know that the area of the rectangular piece is 150 sq m. So, we can set up the equation: x(4x + 1) = 150 Simplifying this equation, we get: 4x^2 + x - 150 = 0 We can solve for x using the quadratic formula: x = (-1 \u00b1 \u221a(1 + 4(4)(150)))/(2(4)) x = (-1 \u00b1 19)/8 We can ignore the negative solution, so: x = 9/2 meters (approx. 4.5 meters) Now, we can find the length of the rectangular piece: length = 4x + 1 = 4(9/2) + 1 = 19 meters Finally, we can find the perimeter of the rectangular piece: perimeter = 2(length + breadth) = 2(19 + 9/2) = 2(47/2) = 47 meters Therefore, the answer is (B) 61 m.

This means that you cover the remaining (S-20) steps in (10-1) = 9 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n(S-20)/E = 9\n\nFrom the second condition, we know that if you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach the ground in 20 minutes. This means that you cover the remaining (S-10) steps in (20-1) = 19 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n(S-10)/E = 19\n\nNow, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of S and E. \n\nMultiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting it from the second equation, we get:\n\n(S-10)/E - 2(S-20)/E = 19 - 2(9)\n\nSolving for S, we get:\n\nS = 90\n\nSubstituting this value of S in either of the two equations, we can solve for E. \n\nUsing the first equation, we get:\n\n(90-20)/E = 9\n\nE = 7.5/3 = 2.5\n\nTherefore, the speed of the elevator is 2.5 steps/minute. \n\nThe closest answer choice is (E) None of the above.",

            "Question": "Q: A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the volume of the coin made of alloy. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula: volume = \u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Since the diameter of the coin is 15 mm, the radius is 7.5 mm. Therefore, the volume of the coin is: volume = \u03c0(7.5 mm)^2(2 mm) = 352.5 mm^3. \n\nSince the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, we can assume that half of the volume of the coin is aluminum and the other half is silver. Therefore, the volume of aluminum in the coin is: 352.5 mm^3 / 2 = 176.25 mm^3. \n\nWe are given that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum. Therefore, the weight of the silver in the coin is twice the weight of the aluminum. Let's assume that the weight of the aluminum in the coin is x grams. Then, the weight of the silver in the coin is 2x grams. \n\nThe density of a material is given by the formula: density = mass/volume. The density of aluminum is 2.7 g/cm^3, and the density of silver is 10.5 g/cm^3. Since the volume of aluminum in the coin is 176.25 mm^3, the mass of the aluminum in the coin is: \n\nmass of aluminum = density of aluminum x volume of aluminum = 2.7 g/cm^3 x 0.17625 cm^3 = 0.4753125 g \n\nSimilarly, the mass of the silver in the coin is: \n\nmass of silver = density of silver x volume of silver = 10.5 g/cm^3 x 0.17625 cm^3 = 1.84828125 g \n\nThe total weight of the coin is 30 grams. Therefore, we can set up the equation: \n\nweight of aluminum + weight of silver = 30 g \n\n0.4753125 g + 1.84828125 g = 30 g \n\n2.32359375 g = 30 g \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx = 12.91 g \n\nTherefore, the weight of a coin made of pure aluminum with the same dimensions as the original coin is 12.91 grams. \n\nHowever, the question asks for the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum. Since the thickness of the original coin is 2 mm, we need to adjust the weight of the pure aluminum coin accordingly. \n\nThe volume of the pure aluminum coin is: \n\nvolume = \u03c0r^2h = \u03c0(15 mm/2)^2(1 mm) = 176.625 mm^3 \n\nThe mass of the pure aluminum coin is: \n\nmass = density x volume = 2.7 g/cm^3 x 0.176625 cm^3 = 0.4771875 g \n\nThe thickness of the pure aluminum coin is 1 mm, which is half the thickness of the original coin. Therefore, the weight of the pure aluminum coin with the same dimensions as the original coin is: \n\nweight = 0.4771875 g x 2 = 0.954375 g \n\nConverting to grams, we get: \n\nweight = 0.954375 g = 0.95 g \n\nTherefore, the answer is none of the above.",
