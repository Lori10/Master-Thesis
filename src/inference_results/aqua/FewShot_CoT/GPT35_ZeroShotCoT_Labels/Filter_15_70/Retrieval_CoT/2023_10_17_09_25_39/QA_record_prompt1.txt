This means that she covers 15 km in 15/10 = 1.5 hours (since she takes a 10-minute break after every 15 km). Therefore, to cover 100 km, she would need to cover 6 sets of 15 km, which would take her 6 x 1.5 = 9 hours. However, we need to add the time she spends taking breaks. She takes a 10-minute break after every 15 km, so she would take 6 breaks in total. Each break is 10 minutes, so the total time she spends taking breaks is 6 x 10 = 60 minutes = 1 hour.

Let's assume that Jill takes x hours to clean (1/3) of the yacht. Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of Jack's rate of cleaning, which means her rate of cleaning is (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht per hour. Using the concept of work done, we can say that: Jack's work done + Jill's work done = Total work done (2/3) + (1/3) = 1 (1/x) + (1/240) * t = (1/3) where t is the time taken by Jill to clean (1/3) of the yacht.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the number of members in the club be n. Let the age of the youngest member be x. Since the common difference is 3 months, the age of the oldest member will be x + (n-1) * (3/12) years. Simplifying, we get x + (n-1) * (1/4) years. \n\nThe sum of the ages of all the members is given as 250. So, we can write:\n\nn/2 * [2x + (n-1) * (1/4)] = 250\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nn * [2x + (n-1) * (1/4)] = 500\n\nExpanding, we get:\n\n2nx + n^2 * (1/4) - n = 500\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4, we get:\n\n8nx + n^2 - 4n = 2000\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\nn^2 + (8x-4) * n - 2000 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nn = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nwhere a = 1, b = (8x-4), and c = -2000\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nn = (-8x + 4 \u00b1 sqrt((8x-4)^2 + 4 * 2000)) / 2\n\nSince x = 7 years, we get:\n\nn = (-56 + 4 \u00b1 sqrt(1936)) / 2\n\nn = (-52 \u00b1 44) / 2\n\nn = 18 or n = -13\n\nSince the number of members cannot be negative, the answer is 18.

So, we can write an equation as: 18x + 18(x+1) = 100 Simplifying this equation, we get: 36x + 18 = 100 36x = 82 x = 2.28 (approx) Therefore, the cost of each brown sharpener is Rs. 2.28 (approx) and the cost of each white sharpener is Rs. 3.28 (approx). Now, we can find the number of brown and white sharpeners Jack bought by using the total number of sharpeners he bought, which is 18. Let the number of brown sharpeners be y. Then, the number of white sharpeners will be 18 - y. We know that the total cost of all the brown sharpeners is y*2.28 and the total cost of all the white sharpeners is (18-y)*3.28. We also know that the total cost of all the sharpeners is Rs. 100. So, we can write another equation as: y*2.28 + (18-y)*3.28 = 100 Simplifying this equation, we get: 2.28y + 58.96 - 3.28y = 100 - 58.96 y = 10.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step. Let the cost price of the book be x. We know that the book was sold for Rs.27.50 with a profit of 10%. So, we can write: Selling price = Cost price + Profit Profit = 10% of Cost price = 0.1x Selling price = Cost price + 0.1x = Rs.27.50 We can write another equation using the second scenario where the book is sold for Rs.25.75: Selling price = Rs.25.75 We need to find the profit or loss percentage in this case. Let's assume that the profit or loss percentage is y%. We can write: Selling price = Cost price + Profit or loss Profit or loss = y% of Cost price = (y/100)x Selling price = Cost price - (y/100)x = Rs.25.75 We can solve these two equations to find the value of x and y. From the first equation, we get: Cost price + 0.1x = Rs.27.50 Cost price = Rs.27.50 - 0.1x From the second equation, we get: Cost price - (y/100)x = Rs.25.75 Substituting the value of Cost price from the first equation, we get: Rs.27.50 - 0.1x - (y/100)x = Rs.25.75 Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.9x - (y/100)x = Rs.25.75 - Rs.27.50 -0.1x - (y/100)x = -Rs.1.75 -10x - yx/100 = -175 yx/100 = -175 + 10x y = (-175 + 10x) / x Now, we know that the profit percentage is 10% when the book is sold for Rs.27.50. Substituting these values in the equation for y, we get: y = (-175 + 10*27.5) / 27.5 = -2% Therefore, the profit or loss percentage when the book is sold for Rs.25.75 is 2% loss.

Then, the number of brass coins she brought would be (17 - x), where 17 is the total number of coins she brought. According to the problem, the coin-diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. So, the total amount she got from the copper coins = 20x cents The total amount she got from the brass coins = 25(17 - x) cents According to the problem, the total amount she got after one dive is $3.40 or 340 cents. So, we can write an equation as: 20x + 25(17 - x) = 340 Simplifying this equation, we get: 5x = 55 x = 11 Therefore, the number of copper coins that the coin-diver brought is 11.

So, we can write another equation:\n\nx + 620y = 2040\n\nNow, we can solve these two equations to find the values of x and y.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can solve this problem by using casework. We need to consider the different combinations of candy bars that can be selected to have a total cost of more than $4. \n\nCase 1: Selecting three candy bars that cost $2 each\nThere are 4 candy bars that cost $2 each, so the number of ways to select 3 of them is 4C3 = 4.\n\nCase 2: Selecting two candy bars that cost $2 each and one candy bar that costs $1\nThere are 4 candy bars that cost $2 each and 4 candy bars that cost $1 each. The number of ways to select 2 of the $2 candy bars is 4C2 = 6, and the number of ways to select 1 of the $1 candy bars is 4C1 = 4. Therefore, the total number of ways to select 3 candy bars in this case is 6 x 4 = 24.\n\nCase 3: Selecting one candy bar that costs $2, one candy bar that costs $1, and one candy bar that costs $0.50\nThere are 4 candy bars that cost $2 each, 4 candy bars that cost $1 each, and 3 candy bars that cost $0.50 each. The number of ways to select 1 of the $2 candy bars is 4C1 = 4, the number of ways to select 1 of the $1 candy bars is 4C1 = 4, and the number of ways to select 1 of the $0.50 candy bars is 3C1 = 3. Therefore, the total number of ways to select 3 candy bars in this case is 4 x 4 x 3 = 48.\n\nThe total number of ways to select 3 candy bars with a total cost of more than $4 is the sum of the number of ways in each case: 4 + 24 + 48 = 76. \n\nHowever, we need to subtract the number of ways to select 3 candy bars with a total cost of exactly $4, which is selecting two candy bars that cost $2 each and one candy bar that costs $0.50. There are 4 candy bars that cost $2 each and 3 candy bars that cost $0.50 each. The number of ways to select 2 of the $2 candy bars is 4C2 = 6, and the number of ways to select 1 of the $0.50 candy bars is 3C1 = 3. Therefore, the total number of ways to select 3 candy bars with a total cost of exactly $4 is 6 x 3 = 18.\n\nThe final answer is 76 - 18 = 58, which is not one of the answer choices.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's break down the problem. We know that Raj is 17 years old now. Let's call his age R. We also know that Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back. Let's call Rahim's age 5 years back as x. So, 5 years back, we can set up the equation: R = (1/3)x Simplifying, we get: x = 3R Now, we need to find Rahim's current age. Rahim's current age would be (x + 5 + 5), since 5 years have passed since 5 years back. Substituting the value of x, we get: Rahim's current age = 3R + 10 We know that Raj is 17 years old now. Substituting this value in the equation R = (1/3)x, we get: 17 = (1/3)x x = 51 Substituting the value of x in the equation Rahim's current age = 3R + 10, we get: Rahim's current age = 3(17) + 10 = 61 years Hence, the correct answer is (E) 43.

Therefore, 9^3 ends in a 9. \n\nNext, we need to subtract 7 from 9^3. Since we are only concerned with the units digit, we can ignore all the other digits and focus on the units digit of 9^3 and 7. The units digit of 9^3 is 9, and the units digit of 7 is 7. \n\nTo subtract 7 from 9, we need to borrow from the tens digit, which becomes 8. Therefore, the units digit of 9 - 7 is 2. \n\nSo, the units digit of 9^3 - 7 is 9 - 2 = 7. Therefore, the answer is (B) 3. The answer is B.",

We know that the total number of working days is 15, so x + y = 15. We also know that the average wage during the first 7 days was $87 per day, so the total wage during the first 7 days was 87x. Similarly, the total wage during the last 7 days was 92y. We know that the average wage during the entire fortnight was $90 per day, so the total wage during the entire fortnight was 90 x 15 = 1350. We can set up an equation using the above information: (87x + 92y) / 15 = 90 Solving for x + y = 15, we get y = 15 - x. Substituting this in the above equation, we get: (87x + 92(15 - x)) / 15 = 90 Solving for x, we get x = 8. Therefore, the worker worked for 8 days during the first 7 days and 7 days during the last 7 days. We can now find the wage on the 8th day: Total wage during the first 8 days = 87 x 8 = 696 Total wage during the last 7 days = 92 x 7 = 644 Total wage during the entire fortnight = 90 x 15 = 1350 Wage on the 8th day = Total wage during the entire fortnight - Total wage during the first 8 days - Total wage during the last 7 days = 1350 - 696 - 644 = 10 Therefore, the wage on the 8th day was $10.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's start by using algebra to solve the problem. Let's call the total number of people who took the survey \"x\". We know that 60% of them were women, so the number of women who took the survey is 0.6x. We also know that the remaining 40% of the people who took the survey were men. Therefore, the number of men who took the survey is 0.4x. We know that 75% of the men preferred red cars, so the number of men who preferred red cars is 0.75(0.4x) = 0.3x. We also know that 10 men liked green cars more than red, so the number of men who preferred green cars is 0.4x - 0.3x + 10 = 0.1x + 10. We can set up an equation to solve for x: \n\n0.6x + 0.4x = 0.3x + 0.1x + 10 \n\nSimplifying the equation: \n\n1x = 100 \n\nTherefore, the total number of people who took the survey is x = 100. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 100.

Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The company produces 420 units of a computer component every month, so it produces 420 x 12 = 5,040 units per year. The production cost per component is $110, so the total production cost per year is 5,040 x $110 = $554,400. To make a profit of $626,400 per year, the revenue from sales must be at least $1,180,800 ($554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800). To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee this revenue, we can set up an equation: Revenue = Selling Price x Number of Units Revenue = SP x 5,040 We know that Revenue must be at least $1,180,800, so we can write: SP x 5,040 \u2265 $1,180,800 Dividing both sides by 5,040, we get: SP \u2265 $234.13 Rounding up to the nearest cent, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234.14.

Now, let's assume that the two trains meet after t hours. Train M has been traveling for t hours and Train N has been traveling for t - 1.5 hours. Let's use the formula: distance = speed x time Distance covered by Train M + Distance covered by Train N = Total distance between the two cities Let's assume that the distance between the two cities is \"d\". The speed of Train M is d/4 (since it covers the distance in 4 hours) and the speed of Train N is d/3.5 (since it covers the distance in 3.5 hours).

Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 50% (D) 65% (E) 75%",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume the current population of Boomtown is \"x\". According to the problem, the population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. So, after one year, the population will be x + 0.1x = 1.1x. After two years, the population will be 1.1x + 0.1(1.1x) = 1.21x. According to the problem, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. So, we can write: 1.21x = 2(1.1x) Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 10/21 So, the current population of Boomtown is 10/21 of the population two years from now. Therefore, the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year is: [(1.1x - x)/x] x 100% = 10/21 x 100% = 47.62% (rounded to two decimal places) The closest answer choice is (D) 65%.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find out how much time Train A has been traveling before Train B starts. Train A starts at 11 am and Train B starts at 2 pm, which means Train A has been traveling for 3 hours before Train B starts. In 3 hours, Train A covers a distance of 40 x 3 = 120 km. Now, let's assume that the two trains meet after t hours. In that case, Train A would have traveled for t + 3 hours and Train B would have traveled for t hours. Using the formula: distance = speed x time, we can set up the equation: 40(t + 3) + 72t = distance between Mumbai and Lucknow Simplifying the equation, we get: 112t = distance between Mumbai and Lucknow - 120 We don't know the distance between Mumbai and Lucknow, so we can't solve for t directly. However, we do know that the two trains will meet somewhere between Mumbai and Lucknow, so the distance between them will be the same as the distance between Mumbai and Lucknow. Let's assume that the distance between Mumbai and Lucknow is \"d\". In that case, the distance between the two trains when they meet will be \"d - 120\" for Train A and \"d\" for Train B. Setting these two distances equal to each other, we get: d - 120 = d - 72t Solving for t, we get: t = (d - 120)/72 Now, we can substitute this value of t into the equation we derived earlier: 112t = d - 120 112((d - 120)/72) = d - 120 Solving for d, we get: d = 840 Therefore, the distance between Mumbai and Lucknow is 840 km.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can get a 4% discount if he pays within 30 days, or he can pay the full amount within n days. Let's assume that the merchant borrows money to pay the invoice and takes advantage of the discount. Then, he will have to pay 96% of the invoice amount, which is $20,000 * 0.96 = $19,200. Let's assume that he borrows the money for n days at a simple interest rate of r%. Then, the interest he will have to pay is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time / 100 = $19,200 * r * n / 36500 Now, he can afford to borrow money only if the interest he has to pay is less than the discount he gets: $20,000 * 0.04 = $800 Therefore, we have the inequality: $19,200 * r * n / 36500 < $800 Simplifying this inequality, we get: r * n < 800 * 36500 / 19200 r * n < 152.0833 r < 152.0833 / n Therefore, the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money is 152.0833 / n %. Since we don't know the value of n, we cannot calculate the exact interest rate. Therefore, the answer is (E) None of these.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. Let's assume that the original price of an item is $100. The shopkeeper puts a discount of 20% on the item, which means the item is sold for 80% of the original price, i.e., $80. Now, the shopkeeper wants to sell the item at the original price, which is $100. To find the percentage increase needed to sell the item at the original price, we can use the formula: Percentage increase = (new value - old value) / old value * 100 Plugging in the values, we get: Percentage increase = ($100 - $80) / $80 * 100 Percentage increase = $20 / $80 * 100 Percentage increase = 25% Therefore, the shopkeeper must increase the price by 25% to sell the item at the original price.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation: t1 + 2t1 - 4 = 17 Simplifying: 3t1 = 21 t1 = 7 So it takes Mr. Sam 7 hours to travel to the city by train. Now we can use the second equation to find t2: 2t1 - 4 = t2 2(7) - 4 = t2 t2 = 10 So it takes Mr. Sam 10 hours to return by car.

Therefore, the time taken to cover this distance is: Time taken = Distance / Speed = d / 70 Once he reached B, he turned right around and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Therefore, the time taken to cover this distance is: Time taken = Distance / Speed = d / 90 Now, we know that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. This means that he had covered a distance of (d - 70) while returning from B to A. Let's calculate the time taken to cover this distance: Time taken = Distance / Speed = (d - 70) / 90 Therefore, the total time taken for the entire trip is: Total time taken = d/70 + (d-70)/90 + 3 We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 630: 630 x Total time taken = 9d + 7d - 4900 + 1890 630 x Total time taken = 16d - 3010 Now, we know that the total time taken for the entire trip is 16 hours (3 hours before the end of the trip + 13 hours taken to cover the distance at 70 mph).

What is the probability of the man catching the first train? Answer Choices: (A) 0.9 (B) 0.8 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.65 (E) 1.5",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The first train that comes could be either the main line train or the harbor line train. Let's consider the probability of the man catching each train separately.\n\nThe main line train starts at 5:00 AM and has a frequency of 10 minutes. This means that it will arrive at the station at 5:00 AM, 5:10 AM, 5:20 AM, and so on. The man arrives at the station sometime between 5:00 AM and 5:02 AM. The probability of him catching the main line train is the probability that he arrives at the station before or at the same time as the train. The main line train arrives every 10 minutes, so the probability of the man arriving at the station at the same time as the train is 1/10. The probability of him arriving before the train is the probability of him arriving in the first 10 minutes, which is 2/10. Therefore, the total probability of him catching the main line train is 1/10 + 2/10 = 3/10.\n\nThe harbor line train starts at 5:02 AM and has a frequency of 10 minutes. This means that it will arrive at the station at 5:02 AM, 5:12 AM, 5:22 AM, and so on. The man arrives at the station sometime between 5:00 AM and 5:02 AM. The probability of him catching the harbor line train is the probability that he arrives at the station after the main line train has already left but before the harbor line train arrives. The main line train arrives every 10 minutes, so the probability of him arriving after the main line train has left is 7/10. The harbor line train arrives every 10 minutes, so the probability of him arriving before the harbor line train is 2/10. Therefore, the total probability of him catching the harbor line train is 7/10 * 2/10 = 14/100.\n\nThe probability of him catching the first train that comes is the probability of him catching the main line train plus the probability of him catching the harbor line train, which is 3/10 + 14/100 = 47/100 = 0.47.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's start by finding the total amount of money that could have been won or lost. Since there were 20 flips, the maximum amount that could have been won or lost is $120 (20 x $6). However, we know that neither Christopher nor Jonathan won or lost any money, so the total amount won must be equal to the total amount lost. This means that Christopher must have given Jonathan a total of $60 (since he gives $2 for each head) and Jonathan must have given Christopher a total of $60 (since he gives $3 for each tail). Therefore, the number of heads must be equal to the number of tails. Let's call the number of heads \"x\". Then, the number of tails is 20 - x. The total amount of money won by Christopher is 2x, and the total amount of money won by Jonathan is 3(20 - x) = 60 - 3x. Since they both won the same amount of money, we can set these two expressions equal to each other and solve for x: 2x = 60 - 3x => 5x = 60 => x = 12. Therefore, the coin landed on heads 12 times.

Substituting M and N in terms of a, b, and c, we get:\n\n(100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990\n99a - 99c + 397c = 990\n99a + 298c = 990\na + 3c = 10\n\nSince a > c, the only possible values for (a, c) are (4, 1) and (5, 2).

We know that the plane started when the ship had already traveled 180 miles, so the distance traveled by the plane is \"d - 180\". We also know that the speed of the plane is 10 times the speed of the ship, so the speed of the plane is \"10s\". We can set up the equation: time taken by ship = time taken by plane 180/s = (d - 180)/10s Multiplying both sides by 10s, we get: 1800 = d - 180s Adding 180s to both sides, we get: d = 1800 + 180s We need to eliminate \"s\" to find \"d\". We can use another piece of information to do this. Let's say that the plane and the ship meet after \"t\" hours. We know that the distance traveled by the ship in \"t\" hours is \"st\" and the distance traveled by the plane in \"t\" hours is \"10st\" (since the speed of the plane is 10 times the speed of the ship). We also know that the total distance they travel is \"d\". So, we can set up another equation: st + 10st = d Simplifying this equation, we get: 11st = d Now we can substitute \"11st\" for \"d\" in the equation we found earlier: d = 1800 + 180s becomes 11st = 1800 + 180s Simplifying this equation, we get: 11t = 180 + 16.36s We need to eliminate \"t\" to find \"s\". We can use the fact that the plane started when the ship had already traveled 180 miles to do this. Let's say that the ship takes \"t1\" hours to travel 180 miles. We know that the plane takes \"t2\" hours to travel the same distance. We also know that the speed of the plane is 10 times the speed of the ship. So, we can set up another equation: 180/s = 1800/(10s) - 180/s Simplifying this equation, we get: 2s = 10s - s/5 s = 50 Therefore, the distance they meet from the starting point is: d = 11st = 11(50)t = 550t We don't have enough information to find \"t\", so we can't find the exact value of \"d\".

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can start by finding the individual rates of work for Sharon and Karen. Sharon can earn enough tips to buy the cake in 5 hours, so her rate of work is 1/5 of the cake per hour. Similarly, Karen's rate of work is 1/4 of the cake per hour. When they work together, their rates of work add up. So, the combined rate of work is: 1/5 + 1/4 = 9/20 of the cake per hour. To find how long it will take them to earn enough tips to buy the cake together, we can use the formula: time = work / rate. The work they need to do is 1 (buying the whole cake), and their combined rate of work is 9/20. time = 1 / (9/20) = 20/9 hours. This is approximately equal to 2.22 hours, which is closest to (C) 3 hours. Therefore, the answer is (C) 3 hours.",

The total length of the fence is the length of (x pickets + (x-1) spaces). There are x-1 spaces because there is one less space than picket. Therefore, the total length of the fence is: Length of fence = x(0.5 feet + 6 feet) + (x-1)(6 feet) Length of fence = 6.5x + 6(x-1) Length of fence = 6.5x + 6x - 6 Length of fence = 13.5x - 6 The answer is (E) (13x-12)/24.",

The area of each semi-circle is (1/2)\u03c0r^2, where r is the radius of the semi-circle. In this case, r = 10 cm. So, the area of each semi-circle is (1/2)\u03c0(10 cm)^2 = 50\u03c0/2 = 25\u03c0 sq. cm. The total area of both semi-circles is 50\u03c0 sq. cm. When we cut out the semi-circles, we are left with a square with two quarter-circles removed. The area of each quarter-circle is (1/4)\u03c0r^2, where r is the radius of the quarter-circle. In this case, r = 10 cm. So, the area of each quarter-circle is (1/4)\u03c0(10 cm)^2 = 25\u03c0/4 sq. cm. The total area of both quarter-circles is 25\u03c0/2 sq. cm. Therefore, the area of the remaining paper is the area of the square minus the area of the two semi-circles and the two quarter-circles, which is: 400 sq. cm - 50\u03c0 sq. cm - 25\u03c0/2 sq. cm = 400 - 75\u03c0/2 sq. cm.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the customer needs to replace all four tires. The cost of purchasing new tires would be 4 x $180 = $720. The cost of repairing the current tires would be 4 x $40 = $160. If the customer purchases new tires, they will last for four years, so the average cost per year would be $720 / 4 = $180. If the customer repairs the current tires, they will last for one additional year, so the total cost for five years would be $160 x 5 = $800. The average cost per year would be $800 / 5 = $160. The percent difference between the average cost per year of new tires and the cost of repairing current tires can be calculated as follows: Percent difference = [(New tires cost per year - Current tires cost per year) / Current tires cost per year] x 100% = [(180 - 160) / 160] x 100% = 12.5% Therefore, the answer is (C) 12.5%.

Therefore, the total number of votes cast is x + 0.85x = 1.85x.\n\nStep 4: The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes, which means he got 50% + 15% = 65% of the votes. Therefore, the number of votes he got is 65% of the total number of votes cast, which is 0.65(1.85x) = 1.2025x.\n\nStep 5: We know that the total number of eligible voters is 4000. Therefore, the total number of votes cast is a percentage of 4000. We can set up the following equation:\n\n1.85x = (100/80) * 4000\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx = 3267.56\n\nTherefore, the winning candidate got approximately 3268 votes.

Since the frog makes a net progress of 1m each day, it will take the frog 30 days to climb out of the well. However, we need to consider that the frog jumps 3m up on the first day, so it only needs to make a net progress of 27m. Therefore, the frog will climb out of the well in 27 days.

Then, the sum of k consecutive integers can be expressed as: x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1) We can simplify this expression using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: S = (n/2)(a + l) where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term. In this case, we have: S = x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1) n = k (there are k terms in the sequence) a = x l = x + k - 1 (the last term is x+k-1) We know that the sum of the k consecutive integers is 51. So, we can write an equation as: S = 51 = (k/2)(2x + k - 1) We also know that the least integer in the sequence is -50. So, we can write another equation as: x = -50 Now, we have two equations and two unknowns (x and k).

Now, in order to win, Mr. Jain needs to select the winning horse as one of his two choices. The probability of selecting the winning horse in one choice is 1/5, since there is only one winning horse out of 5.
