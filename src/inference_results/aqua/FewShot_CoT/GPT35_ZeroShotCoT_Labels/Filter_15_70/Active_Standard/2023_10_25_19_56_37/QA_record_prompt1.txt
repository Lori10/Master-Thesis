Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find out how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht. If he can clean it in 12 hours, then his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the yacht per hour.\n\nNext, we know that Jack completes two-thirds of the work, which means that one-third of the work is left for Jill to complete. Let's call the total amount of work W. Then, Jack completes 2/3W and Jill completes 1/3W.\n\nWe can set up an equation using rates of work. Jack's rate is 1/12W per hour, and Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate, or (5/100)(1/12)W = 1/240W per hour. Let's call the amount of time it takes Jill to complete the remaining work t.\n\nUsing the equation for rates of work, we can set up the following equation:\n\n(1/12)(2/3)W + (1/240)Wt = (1/3)W\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n(1/8)W + (1/240)Wt = (1/3)W\n\nMultiplying both sides by 240 to eliminate the fraction, we get:\n\n30W + Wt = 80W\n\nSubtracting 30W from both sides, we get:\n\nWt = 50W\n\nFinally, we can solve for t by dividing both sides by W:\n\nt = 50\n\nTherefore, it takes Jill 50 hours to complete the remaining work.

Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the total cost of producing 7200 pens. The selling price of each pen is Rs. 10, so the total revenue from selling 7200 pens is 7200 x 10 = Rs. 72,000.\n\nThe overall profit on all the manufactured pens is 25%, which means the total profit is 25% of the total cost. Let's assume the total cost is C. Then, the total profit is 0.25C.\n\nNow, we need to subtract the cost of defective pens from the total cost. We know that 10% of the produced pens are defective, so the cost of defective pens is 10% of the total cost of producing pens. That is, 0.1C.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nC - 0.1C + 0.25C = 72,000\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n0.15C = 72,000\n\nC = 480,000\n\nSo, the total cost of producing 7200 pens is Rs. 480,000. The cost of each pen is the total cost divided by the number of pens produced, which is:\n\n480,000 / 7200 = Rs. 66.67\n\nHowever, this is the cost of each pen before subtracting the cost of defective pens. So, the actual cost of each pen is:\n\n66.67 - (10% of 66.67) = Rs. 60\n\nTherefore, the manufactured cost of each pen is Rs. 6 (Option A).",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the speed of the train from miles per hour to feet per second, since the length of the tunnel is given in feet. \n\n120 miles per hour = 120 x 5280 feet per hour (since 1 mile = 5280 feet) \n\n= 633,600 feet per hour \n\n= 633,600/3600 feet per second (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour) \n\n= 176 feet per second \n\nSo, the train is traveling at a speed of 176 feet per second. \n\nNext, we need to find the length of the train. We are given that the train takes exactly three seconds to enter the tunnel, so we can use the speed of the train to find its length. \n\nDistance = Speed x Time \n\nLength of train + Length of tunnel = Speed x Time \n\nLength of train + 5280 feet = 176 x 3 feet \n\nLength of train + 5280 feet = 528 \n\nLength of train = 528 - 5280 feet \n\nLength of train = -4752 feet \n\nThis is a problem, because it means that the length of the train is negative, which doesn't make sense. \n\nTherefore, there must be an error in the problem statement. Perhaps the speed of the train or the length of the tunnel is different than what was given. \n\nWithout more information, we cannot solve this problem. \n\nThe answer is None of the above.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nLet's assume the monthly sales to be x. \n\nAccording to the problem, the monthly salary S of the shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. \n\nSo, we can write the equation as:\n\nS = 500 + 0.05x\n\nNow, we need to find the monthly sales x so that the monthly salary reaches $1500. \n\nSo, we can write another equation as:\n\nS = 1500\n\nSubstituting the value of S in the equation we got earlier, we get:\n\n1500 = 500 + 0.05x\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n1000 = 0.05x\n\nDividing both sides by 0.05, we get:\n\nx = 20000\n\nTherefore, the monthly sales should be $20000 so that the monthly salary reaches $1500. \n\nHence, the answer is (D) $20000.",

Starting at 8:00 am, Jim's dog ate exactly once an hour, consuming exactly 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session. Approximately, what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 25% (C) 30% (D) 35% (E) 40%",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.\n\nLet's assume that the original amount of dog food in the bowl was 100 units (it could be any number, but let's assume it's 100 for simplicity).\n\nAt 9:00 am, the dog has eaten 1/3 of the remaining food, which is 1/3 * 100 = 33.33 units. So, there is 100 - 33.33 = 66.67 units of food left.\n\nAt 10:00 am, the dog has eaten 1/3 of the remaining food, which is 1/3 * 66.67 = 22.22 units. So, there is 66.67 - 22.22 = 44.45 units of food left.\n\nAt 11:00 am, the dog has eaten 1/3 of the remaining food, which is 1/3 * 44.45 = 14.82 units. So, there is 44.45 - 14.82 = 29.63 units of food left.\n\nAt 12:00 pm, the dog has eaten 1/3 of the remaining food, which is 1/3 * 29.63 = 9.88 units. So, there is 29.63 - 9.88 = 19.75 units of food left.\n\nTherefore, right before the dog began to eat at noon, there was 19.75 units of food left out of the original 100 units. To find the percentage, we can use the formula:\n\npercentage = (part/whole) * 100\n\nSo, the percentage of the original food that was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon is:\n\npercentage = (19.75/100) * 100 = 19.75%\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 20%, which is option (A).",

We can do this by considering the different cases:\n\nCase 1: Select all three candy bars that cost $2 each.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nLet the original side of the square piece of cloth be x feet. After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the rectangular piece will have dimensions (x-4) by x. \n\nThe area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. Therefore, the area of each triangle can be calculated as (1/2) * base * height. \n\nLet the base of each triangle be b and the height be h. Then, we have:\n\n(1/2) * b * h = 70\n\nb * h = 140\n\nSince the rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half to create two triangles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the dimensions of the rectangular piece to the dimensions of the triangles. \n\nThe diagonal of the rectangular piece is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the two sides of the rectangle. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\n(diagonal)^2 = (x-4)^2 + x^2\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n(diagonal)^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16\n\n(diagonal)^2 = 2(x^2 - 4x + 8)\n\n(diagonal)^2 = 2[(x-2)^2 + 4]\n\n(diagonal)^2 = 2(x-2)^2 + 8\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet to relate the dimensions of the triangles to the dimensions of the rectangular piece. \n\nThe area of each triangle is given by (1/2) * base * height. Since the two triangles are congruent, we have:\n\n(1/2) * b * h = 70\n\nb * h = 140\n\nThe base of each triangle is equal to the diagonal of the rectangular piece, and the height of each triangle is half the width of the rectangular piece. Therefore, we have:\n\nb = diagonal = sqrt(2(x-2)^2 + 8)\n\nh = (x-4)/2\n\nSubstituting these expressions for b and h into the equation b * h = 140, we get:\n\nsqrt[2(x-2)^2 + 8] * (x-4)/2 = 140\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nsqrt[2(x-2)^2 + 8] = 280/(x-4)\n\nSquaring both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n2(x-2)^2 + 8 = 784/(x-4)^2\n\nMultiplying both sides by (x-4)^2, we get:\n\n2(x-2)^2(x-4)^2 + 8(x-4)^2 = 784\n\nExpanding the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n2x^4 - 24x^3 + 104x^2 - 192x + 128 = 784\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2x^4 - 24x^3 + 104x^2 - 192x - 656 = 0\n\nWe can solve this equation using numerical methods or by factoring. One possible factorization is:\n\n2(x-8)(x-2)(x^2 - 6x - 41) = 0\n\nThe only positive root of this equation is x = 8. Therefore, the original piece of cloth was a square with side length 8 feet. \n\nThe perimeter of the original piece of cloth is 4 times the side length, which is 4 * 8 = 32 feet. \n\nTherefore, the answer is not among the given answer choices.

Then we can set up the following equations based on the given information:\n\nx + y = 35 (total number of toys made)\n7x + 9y = k (total number of hours worked, where k is some constant)\n\nWe can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by the greatest common factor of 7 and 9, which is 1:\n\n7x + 9y = k\n7x/1 + 9y/1 = k/1\n7x + 9y = k\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables. We can solve for one variable in terms of the other and substitute into the other equation to solve for the remaining variable. Let's solve for x in terms of y:\n\nx + y = 35\nx = 35 - y\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n\n7x + 9y = k\n7(35 - y) + 9y = k\n245 - 7y + 9y = k\n2y = k - 245\ny = (k - 245)/2\n\nNow we know that y is some expression in terms of k.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nLet's start by finding the cost price of one bag of ice. We know that the grocery makes a 20% profit, which means that the selling price is 120% of the cost price. We can write this as:\n\n1.2x = 1.25\n\nwhere x is the cost price of one bag of ice. Solving for x, we get:\n\nx = 1.25/1.2 = 1.04\n\nSo the cost price of one bag of ice is $1.04.\n\nNow we can find the total cost of 500 bags of ice:\n\nTotal cost = 500 x 1.04 = $520\n\nThe total revenue from selling 500 bags of ice is:\n\nTotal revenue = 500 x 1.25 = $625\n\nThe total profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:\n\nTotal profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $625 - $520 = $105\n\nTherefore, the grocery makes a total profit of $105 by selling 500 bags of ice.

This doesn't change the distance from home, but it changes the direction. Now A is 3 km away from home in the south direction and 5 km away from home in the east direction.\n\nNext, A traveled 3 km towards the north. This cancels out the initial southward travel and brings A back to the same latitude as home. So now A is 5 km away from home in the east direction.\n\nFinally, A traveled 2 km towards the west. This brings A closer to home by 2 km. So the final distance of A from home is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of 5 km and 2 km.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nLet's assume there are 'n' members in the family. \n\nWe know that the median income is $3000. This means that there are (n/2) members who earn less than $3000 and (n/2) members who earn more than $3000.\n\nThe total income of the family is $9000. Therefore, the average income of each member is $9000/n.\n\nNow, let's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: n is even\nIn this case, the median income is the average of the incomes of the (n/2)th and (n/2 + 1)th members. Since the median income is $3000, we can write:\n\n(n/2)th income + (n/2 + 1)th income = 2 x $3000 = $6000\n\nSince the total income of the family is $9000, we can write:\n\nTotal income of (n/2 - 1) members + $6000 + Total income of (n/2 - 1) members = $9000\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nTotal income of (n - 2) members = $3000 x (n - 2)\n\nSince the average income of each member is $9000/n, we can write:\n\n$9000/n x n = $3000 x (n - 2)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nn = 6\n\nTherefore, there are 6 members in the family.\n\nCase 2: n is odd\nIn this case, the median income is the income of the (n+1)/2th member. Since the median income is $3000, we can write:\n\n(n+1)/2th income = $3000\n\nSince the total income of the family is $9000, we can write:\n\nTotal income of (n-1)/2 members + $3000 + Total income of (n-1)/2 members = $9000\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nTotal income of (n-1) members = $6000\n\nSince the average income of each member is $9000/n, we can write:\n\n$9000/n x n = $6000\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nn = 6\n\nTherefore, there are 6 members in the family.\n\nHence, the answer is (E) 6.",

Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's break down the problem. \n\nWe know that the company produces 420 units of a computer component every month, and the production cost per component is $110. So the total production cost per month is:\n\n420 x $110 = $46,200\n\nNow, let's assume that the company sells each component for $x. So the revenue per month is:\n\n420 x $x = $420x\n\nThe yearly revenue will be:\n\n$420x x 12 = $5,040x\n\nThe yearly profit will be the revenue minus the production cost:\n\nYearly profit = $5,040x - $46,200\n\nWe want to find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400. So we can set up an equation:\n\n$5,040x - $46,200 \u2265 $626,400\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$5,040x \u2265 $672,600\n\nDividing both sides by 5040, we get:\n\nx \u2265 $133.33\n\nSo the minimum selling price per component should be $133.33 or higher to guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400. \n\nHowever, none of the answer choices match this value. We can calculate the closest answer choice by dividing $626,400 by the total number of components produced in a year:\n\n$626,400 \u00f7 (420 x 12) = $39.68\n\nAdding the production cost of $110, we get:\n\n$39.68 + $110 = $149.68\n\nSo the closest answer choice is (E) 280, which is higher than the actual minimum selling price of $133.33.",

So, the length of each part is (48/2) - b = 24 - b. Therefore, the total length of the sheet is 2(24 - b) = 48 - 2b.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the breadth, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm. So, the breadth of each part is (66/2) - l = 33 - l. Therefore, the total breadth of the sheet is 2(33 - l) = 66 - 2l.\n\nNow, we know that the area of the rectangular sheet is given by A = lb.\n\nWe also know that the total length and breadth of the sheet are 48 - 2b and 66 - 2l respectively.\n\nSo, lb = (48 - 2b)(66 - 2l)\n\nExpanding the above equation, we get:\n\nlb = 3168 - 132l - 96b + 4lb\n\nSimplifying the above equation, we get:\n\n3lb - 96b - 132l + 3168 = 0\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\n\nlb - 32b - 44l + 1056 = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the value of lb.

Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we know that Neha is 12th from the left end and Radha is 6th from the right end. Therefore, the total number of children in the row is:\n\n12 + 6 - 1 = 17\n\nNext, we know that when Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to the right by 2 places, there are 6 children between them. This means that the distance between Radha and Neha was originally:\n\n6 - 2 - 2 = 2\n\nNow, we can use this information to find the total number of children in the row. We know that there are 2 children between Radha and Neha, and we also know that Neha is 12th from the left end and Radha is 6th from the right end. This means that there are:\n\n12 - 1 = 11 children to the left of Neha\n6 - 1 = 5 children to the right of Radha\n\nSo, the total number of children in the row is:\n\n11 + 2 + 5 = 18\n\nHowever, we shifted Radha and Neha by 2 places, so we need to subtract 4 from the total number of children:\n\n18 - 4 = 14\n\nTherefore, there are 14 children in the row.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The first train starts at 11 am and the second train starts at 2 pm, which means the second train starts 3 hours later than the first train. \n\nIn those 3 hours, the first train covers a distance of 40 kmph x 3 hours = 120 km. \n\nNow, let's say the two trains meet after t hours of the second train's journey. \n\nDistance covered by the first train = 40t + 120 (since it started 3 hours earlier) \n\nDistance covered by the second train = 72t \n\nTotal distance covered = distance between Mumbai and Lucknow \n\nWe don't know the distance between Mumbai and Lucknow, but we do know that the two trains will meet somewhere in between. \n\nLet's call the distance between Mumbai and the meeting point \"d\". \n\nSo, the distance between the meeting point and Lucknow will be (total distance - d). \n\nUsing the formula: \n\ndistance = speed x time \n\nWe can say: \n\nd/40 + (total distance - d)/72 = t \n\nSimplifying this equation: \n\nd/40 + total distance/72 - d/72 = t \n\ntotal distance/72 - d/40 = t \n\ntotal distance/72 = t + d/40 \n\ntotal distance = 72t + 1.8d \n\nNow, we need to find the value of \"t\" when the two trains meet. \n\nWe know that the average speed of the two trains is: \n\n(total distance)/(total time) \n\nWe also know that the two trains meet at the same time, so their total time is \"t\". \n\nSo, the average speed of the two trains is: \n\n(total distance)/t \n\nWe can equate these two expressions: \n\n(total distance)/(total time) = (total distance)/t \n\n(total distance) cancels out: \n\n1/(total time) = 1/t \n\ntotal time = t \n\nThis means that the two trains will meet after t hours of the second train's journey, which is also the total time taken by both trains to cover the distance between Mumbai and the meeting point. \n\nNow, we need to find the value of \"t\". \n\nSubstituting the value of \"total distance\" in the equation: \n\ntotal distance = 72t + 1.8d \n\nWe get: \n\ntotal distance = 72t + 1.8(total distance - d) \n\ntotal distance = 72t + 1.8total distance - 1.8d \n\n0.2total distance = 72t + 1.8d \n\ntotal distance = 360 km (since we know that the average temperature is 40 and the lowest temperature is 30, so the maximum temperature can be 50) \n\nSubstituting the value of \"total distance\" in the equation: \n\ntotal distance = 72t + 1.8d \n\nWe get: \n\n360 = 72t + 1.8d \n\nWe need one more equation to solve for \"t\" and \"d\". \n\nLet's go back to the equation: \n\nd/40 + (total distance - d)/72 = t \n\nSubstituting the value of \"total distance\": \n\nd/40 + (360 - d)/72 = t \n\nSimplifying: \n\n9d/40 + 5d/8 = t \n\n23d/40 = t \n\nSubstituting this value of \"t\" in the equation: \n\n360 = 72t + 1.8d \n\nWe get: \n\n360 = 72(23d/40) + 1.8d \n\nSimplifying: \n\n360 = 41.4d + 1.8d \n\n360 = 43.2d \n\nd = 8.33 km \n\nSo, the two trains will meet 8.33 km away from Mumbai. \n\nTo find the time, we can use the equation: \n\nd/40 + (total distance - d)/72 = t \n\nSubstituting the value of \"d\" and \"total distance\": \n\n8.33/40 + (360 - 8.33)/72 = t \n\n0.21 + 4.93 = t \n\nt = 5.14 hours \n\nSo, the two trains will meet 5.14 hours after the second train starts, which is at 7:14 pm. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 5 pm on the next day.",

We don't know what \"t\" is yet, but we can use it to set up an equation: \n\ndistance = 9t \n\nWe know that the total distance they need to cover is 75 cm, so we can set up another equation: \n\ndistance = 75 - 6t \n\nNow we can set these two equations equal to each other, since they represent the same distance: \n\n9t = 75 - 6t \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n15t = 75 \n\nt = 5 \n\nSo it takes 5 hours for the ants to meet. \n\nNow we can plug this value of \"t\" into either of our distance equations to find how far ant A travels: \n\ndistance = 9t = 9 x 5 = 45 \n\nSo ant A travels 45 cm before meeting ant B. \n\nThe answer is (A) 45.",

Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, let's assume that the distance between X and Y is d km. \n\nWhen Allen and Bob meet for the first time, they have covered a total distance of d km. Let's say that Allen has covered x km and Bob has covered (d-x) km. \n\nUsing the formula distance = speed x time, we can write: \n\nx/54 = (d-x)/78 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx = 18d/65 \n\nSo, at the first meeting point, Allen has covered 18d/65 km and Bob has covered 47d/65 km. \n\nNow, Allen turns back and starts moving towards X. Bob continues towards Y. \n\nWhen they meet for the second time, their total distance covered would be equal to the distance between X and Y plus the distance covered by Allen in his return journey. Let's say that Allen covers y km in his return journey. \n\nSo, the total distance covered by Allen would be (18d/65 + y) km and the total distance covered by Bob would be (47d/65 + 48) km. \n\nSince they cover the same distance, we can write: \n\n18d/65 + y = 47d/65 + 48 \n\nSolving for y, we get: \n\ny = 29d/65 - 48 \n\nNow, we know that the average speed of Allen is 54 kmph. So, we can write: \n\nAverage speed = total distance covered / total time taken \n\n54 = (2d + y) / (2t) \n\nSolving for t, we get: \n\nt = (2d + y) / 108 \n\nSubstituting the value of y, we get: \n\nt = (2d + 29d/65 - 48) / 108 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\nt = (221d - 3120) / 7020 \n\nNow, we know that Bob's average speed is 78 kmph. So, we can write: \n\n78 = (2d + 47d/65 + 48) / (2t) \n\nSubstituting the value of t, we get: \n\n78 = (2d + 47d/65 + 48) / [(221d - 3120) / 3510] \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\nd = 126 \n\nTherefore, the distance between X and Y is 126 km. \n\nThe answer is (C) 126 km.",

(Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.) Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the number of possible codes using a single letter. Since there are 26 letters in the alphabet, we can represent 26 different types of books using a single letter.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of possible codes using a pair of two different letters. We can choose the first letter in 26 ways, and the second letter in 25 ways (since we cannot repeat the first letter). However, since the order of letters in a pair does not matter, we need to divide by 2. So, the number of possible codes using a pair of two different letters is (26 x 25) / 2 = 325.\n\nTherefore, the total number of codes needed to represent all 10 types of books is 26 + 325 = 351. \n\nSince the question asks for the smallest number of letters needed, we need to find the smallest number of letters that can represent 351 codes. We can use trial and error to find that 5 letters are enough to represent 351 codes. For example, we can use the letters A, B, C, D, and E to represent the first 5 codes, then AA, AB, AC, AD, AE, BA, BB, BC, BD, BE, CA, CB, CC, CD, CE, etc. to represent the remaining codes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 5.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's break down the problem. \n\nThe terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can get a 4% discount if they pay within 30 days, or they can pay the full amount within n days and get no discount. \n\nSo, if the merchant pays within 30 days, they only have to pay 96% of the original amount, which is:\n\n0.96 x $20,000 = $19,200\n\nNow, let's say the merchant borrows money to take advantage of the discount. They will have to pay back the borrowed amount plus interest within 30 days. Let's call the borrowed amount B and the interest rate R. Then, the total amount the merchant will have to pay back is:\n\nB + BR = B(1 + R)\n\nThis amount should be less than or equal to $19,200, otherwise the merchant will not be able to afford to pay back the borrowed amount and take advantage of the discount. \n\nSo, we have the inequality:\n\nB(1 + R) \u2264 $19,200\n\nNow, let's say the merchant borrows the maximum amount they can afford to pay back, which is $19,200. Then, we can solve for the maximum interest rate R:\n\nB(1 + R) = $19,200\n\nB = $19,200 / (1 + R)\n\nSubstituting this into the inequality, we get:\n\n$19,200 / (1 + R) (1 + R) \u2264 $19,200\n\n1 + R \u2264 1.04\n\nR \u2264 0.04\n\nSo, the maximum interest rate the merchant can afford to borrow money at is 4%. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 247.67.",

Then, the length of the room is 3x.\n\nNext, let's find the area of the four walls of the room. The area of each wall is the height times the length, which is 6x^2. The total area of the four walls is 24x^2.\n\nNow, let's subtract the area of the doors and windows, which is 15 sq.m. This leaves us with 24x^2 - 15 = 9x^2.\n\nWe know that the paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 m. So, the length of paper needed to cover the four walls is the perimeter of the room times the height of the room, which is (2x + 3x) * 2x = 10x^2.\n\nWe also know that the cost of the paper is Rs.2 per meter. So, the cost of the paper needed to cover the four walls is 10x^2 * 2 = 20x^2.\n\nWe can now set up an equation using the information given in the problem:\n\n20x^2 = 260 + 9x^2\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n11x^2 = 260\n\nx^2 = 23.64\n\nx = 4.86\n\nTherefore, the height of the room is 2x = 9.72, which is closest to 10 (since the answer choices are in whole numbers).

If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day? Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we know that the store sold 80% of its inventory, which means it sold 0.8 x 600 = 480 golf balls.\n\nNext, we know that the store sold all of its white golf balls, which means that the number of white golf balls sold is equal to the total number of golf balls sold minus the number of yellow golf balls sold. Let's call the number of yellow golf balls sold \"y\". Then we have:\n\ny + y = 480\n2y = 480\ny = 240\n\nSo the store sold 240 yellow golf balls and 240 white golf balls. Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, it must have started the day with 360 yellow golf balls (600 total golf balls - 240 white golf balls). Therefore, the answer is (E) 360.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nLet's start by using the formula:\n\nTotal = Group 1 + Group 2 - Both + Neither\n\nWe know that the total number of books is 45, the number of hardcover books is 30, and the number of fiction books is 20. We want to find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, which we'll call \"x\".\n\nSo, we can plug in the values we know and solve for \"x\":\n\n45 = 30 + 20 - x + Neither\n\n45 = 50 - x + Neither\n\n-x + Neither = -5\n\nx - Neither = 5\n\nNow, we know that the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction (x) minus the number of books that are neither (Neither) equals 5. We want to find the maximum value of x, so we need to minimize the value of Neither.\n\nThe minimum value of Neither occurs when all of the remaining books (15) are not hardcover or fiction. Therefore, the maximum value of x is:\n\nx = 20 - Neither\n\nx = 20 - 15\n\nx = 5\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 5. The answer is (A) 10.",

If 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, what percentage of all Daifu students are members of the swim team? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 30% (C) 40% (D) 50% (E) 60%",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we know that 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. Let's call the total percentage of students who are members of either the chess club or the swim team (or both) \"x\". Then we can write:\n\nx = percentage in chess club + percentage in swim team - percentage in both\n\nSince we know that 24% are in both, we can substitute that in:\n\nx = percentage in chess club + percentage in swim team - 24\n\nWe also know that 20% of swim team members are not in the chess club. Let's call the percentage of students in the swim team \"y\". Then we can write:\n\ny = percentage in swim team - 20\n\nNow we want to find y as a percentage of all students, so we need to express it in terms of x:\n\ny = (percentage in swim team)/(x) * 100\n\nSubstituting in our expression for x:\n\ny = (percentage in swim team)/(percentage in chess club + percentage in swim team - 24) * 100\n\nNow we can substitute in the fact that x = 100 - percentage not in either:\n\ny = (percentage in swim team)/(76) * 100\n\nFinally, we know that y + percentage in chess club - 24 = x, so we can substitute in our expression for y:\n\n(percentage in swim team)/(76) * 100 + percentage in chess club - 24 = 100 - percentage not in either\n\nSimplifying:\n\n(percentage in swim team)/(76) * 100 + percentage in chess club = 76 + percentage not in either\n\nNow we can substitute in the fact that percentage not in either = 100 - x:\n\n(percentage in swim team)/(76) * 100 + percentage in chess club = 76 + (100 - x)\n\nSubstituting in our expression for x:\n\n(percentage in swim team)/(76) * 100 + percentage in chess club = 76 + (100 - percentage in chess club - percentage in swim team + 24)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n(percentage in swim team)/(76) * 100 + percentage in chess club = 100\n\nNow we can substitute in the fact that the average of the chess club and swim team percentages is 40:\n\n(percentage in swim team)/(76) * 100 + (40 - percentage in swim team) = 100\n\nSimplifying:\n\n(percentage in swim team)/(76) * 100 = 60\n\nSolving for percentage in swim team:\n\npercentage in swim team = 45\n\nTherefore, the answer is D, 50%.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we can assign variables to the cost of a soda and the cost of an energy bar. Let's call the cost of a soda \"s\" and the cost of an energy bar \"e\". \n\nFrom the first piece of information, we know that:\n\n1s + 2e = 150 \n\nFrom the second piece of information, we know that:\n\n2s + 3e = 300 \n\nWe can use these two equations to solve for \"s\" and \"e\". One way to do this is to multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation:\n\n2s + 3e - (2s + 4e) = 300 - 300 \n\n-e = -150 \n\ne = 150 \n\nNow that we know the cost of an energy bar is 150 cents, we can substitute this value into either of the original equations to solve for \"s\". Let's use the first equation:\n\n1s + 2(150) = 150 \n\n1s + 300 = 150 \n\n1s = -150 \n\ns = -150 \n\nWait a minute, a negative cost doesn't make sense! What went wrong? \n\nWe made a mistake when we assumed that the cost of a soda and the cost of an energy bar were both positive. In fact, we can see from the given information that the total cost of one soda and two energy bars is less than the total cost of two sodas and three energy bars. This means that the cost of a soda must be less than the cost of an energy bar. \n\nLet's try again, this time assuming that \"s\" is less than \"e\". \n\n1s + 2e = 150 \n\n2s + 3e = 300 \n\nMultiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting it from the second equation gives:\n\n2s + 3e - (2s + 4e) = 300 - 300 \n\n-e = -150 \n\ne = 150 \n\nSubstituting this value into the first equation gives:\n\n1s + 2(150) = 150 \n\n1s + 300 = 150 \n\n1s = -150 \n\nUh oh, we still got a negative cost! What's going on? \n\nLet's think about what these equations are telling us. The first equation says that one soda and two energy bars cost 150 cents. The second equation says that two sodas and three energy bars cost 300 cents. \n\nIf we subtract the first equation from the second equation, we get:\n\ns + e = 150 \n\nThis tells us that the total cost of one soda and one energy bar is 150 cents. \n\nNow we can use this information to solve for \"s\" and \"e\". \n\ns + e = 150 \n\n2s + 3e = 300 \n\nMultiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting it from the second equation gives:\n\n2s + 3e - (2s + 2e) = 300 - 300 \n\ne = 150 \n\nSubstituting this value into the first equation gives:\n\ns + 150 = 150 \n\ns = 0 \n\nFinally, we have a valid solution! This tells us that a soda costs 0 cents (which doesn't make sense in the real world, but let's ignore that for now) and an energy bar costs 150 cents. \n\nNow we can answer the original question: \n\nSix sodas and seven energy bars would cost:\n\n6(0) + 7(150) = 1050 \n\nSo the answer is (E) 900.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.\n\nThe man borrows Rs. 360 and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs. 31.50 each. \n\nSo, the total amount paid back by the man is 12 x Rs. 31.50 = Rs. 378. \n\nNow, we know that the interest paid by the man is the difference between the amount borrowed and the amount paid back. \n\nSo, the interest paid = Rs. 378 - Rs. 360 = Rs. 18. \n\nThe interest rate can be calculated using the formula: \n\nInterest rate = (Interest paid / Amount borrowed) x 100 \n\nSubstituting the values, we get: \n\nInterest rate = (18 / 360) x 100 = 5% \n\nTherefore, the interest rate is 5%. \n\nHence, the answer is (D) 5%.",

They decide that a coin will be flipped twenty times and each time it turns heads, Christopher will give $2 to Jonathan and each time it turns out to be Tails, Jonathan will give 3$ to Christopher. After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount.\nHow many times did the coin landed on Heads ? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 23 (C) 16 (D) 18 (E) 12",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.\n\nLet's assume that the coin landed on heads x times and tails y times. Since the coin was flipped 20 times, we know that:\n\nx + y = 20\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of money that Christopher would give to Jonathan if the coin landed on heads x times:\n\nTotal amount = 2x\n\nSimilarly, let's calculate the total amount of money that Jonathan would give to Christopher if the coin landed on tails y times:\n\nTotal amount = 3y\n\nSince we know that the total amount of money exchanged was zero, we can set these two expressions equal to each other:\n\n2x = 3y\n\nNow, we need to find a pair of values for x and y that satisfy all three equations. One way to do this is to try different values of x and see if we can find a corresponding value of y that makes all three equations true.\n\nIf x = 10, then y = 10, which satisfies the first equation. Also, 2x = 20 and 3y = 30, so the second equation is not satisfied. Therefore, x cannot be 10.\n\nIf x = 9, then y = 11, which satisfies the first equation. Also, 2x = 18 and 3y = 33, so the second equation is not satisfied. Therefore, x cannot be 9.\n\nIf x = 8, then y = 12, which satisfies the first equation. Also, 2x = 16 and 3y = 36, so the second equation is not satisfied. Therefore, x cannot be 8.\n\nIf x = 7, then y = 13, which satisfies the first equation. Also, 2x = 14 and 3y = 39, so the second equation is not satisfied. Therefore, x cannot be 7.\n\nIf x = 6, then y = 14, which satisfies the first equation. Also, 2x = 12 and 3y = 42, so the second equation is not satisfied. Therefore, x cannot be 6.\n\nIf x = 5, then y = 15, which satisfies the first equation. Also, 2x = 10 and 3y = 45, so the second equation is not satisfied. Therefore, x cannot be 5.\n\nIf x = 4, then y = 16, which satisfies the first equation. Also, 2x = 8 and 3y = 48, so the second equation is not satisfied. Therefore, x cannot be 4.\n\nIf x = 3, then y = 17, which satisfies the first equation. Also, 2x = 6 and 3y = 51, so the second equation is not satisfied. Therefore, x cannot be 3.\n\nIf x = 2, then y = 18, which satisfies the first equation. Also, 2x = 4 and 3y = 54, so the second equation is not satisfied. Therefore, x cannot be 2.\n\nIf x = 1, then y = 19, which satisfies the first equation. Also, 2x = 2 and 3y = 57, so the second equation is not satisfied. Therefore, x cannot be 1.\n\nIf x = 0, then y = 20, which satisfies the first equation. Also, 2x = 0 and 3y = 60, so the second equation is not satisfied. Therefore, x cannot be 0.\n\nSince none of the values of x work, there is no solution to this problem.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nLet's assume that the length of the rectangular yard is L meters and the width is W meters. We know that the area of the yard is 240 square meters, so we can write:\n\nL x W = 240\n\nWe also know that Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. This means that the total length of the three sides that need fencing is:\n\n2L + W - 10\n\nWe subtract 10 from the width because one side of 10 meters is already unfenced.\n\nWe can now write an equation for the total length of fencing needed:\n\n2L + W - 10 = length of fencing\n\nWe need to eliminate one of the variables from these two equations to solve for the other variable. We can do this by solving the first equation for one of the variables and substituting it into the second equation. Let's solve the first equation for L:\n\nL = 240/W\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for L into the second equation:\n\n2(240/W) + W - 10 = length of fencing\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n480/W + W - 10 = length of fencing\n\nTo find the value of W that minimizes the length of fencing, we can take the derivative of the equation with respect to W and set it equal to zero:\n\nd/dW (480/W + W - 10) = -480/W^2 + 1 = 0\n\nSolving for W, we get:\n\nW = sqrt(480)\n\nW \u2248 21.91\n\nNow we can use this value of W to find the corresponding value of L:\n\nL = 240/W \u2248 10.96\n\nFinally, we can substitute these values of L and W into the equation for the length of fencing:\n\n2L + W - 10 \u2248 54.83\n\nTherefore, Alice needs approximately 54.83 meters of fencing.

A regular pentagon is a polygon with five sides of equal length and five angles of equal measure. \n\nNext, we need to understand what a quadrilateral is. A quadrilateral is a polygon with four sides. \n\nNow, we need to figure out how many ways we can choose four points from the given set of points (A, B, C, D, E, and F) to form a quadrilateral. \n\nOne way to approach this is to use combinations. We can choose four points from a set of six points in 6C4 ways, which is equal to 15. \n\nHowever, we need to be careful because not all combinations of four points will form a quadrilateral. For example, if we choose points A, B, C, and D, we will get a quadrilateral, but if we choose points A, B, C, and F, we will get a triangle. \n\nTo avoid counting triangles, we need to exclude combinations that include the center point F.

This means that TS = ST - UT = 2x - x = x.\n\n```\nR-----S------------------T-----U\n     5             17     2x\n                       x\n```\n\nWe also know that RS = 5. This means that RT - RS = ST - UT - RS = 2x - x - 5 = x - 5.\n\n```\nR-----S------------------T-----U\n     5             17     2x\n                       x\n                  x - 5\n```\n\nSince U is the midpoint of TS, we know that TU = US. This means that RU = RT - TU = 17 - x.\n\n```\nR-----S------------------T-----U\n     5             17     2x\n                       x\n                  x - 5\n              17 - x\n```\n\nWe want to find the length of RU, so we need to find x. We know that the average of RS, RT, and ST is 48 (since the average of all five temperatures is 40). This means that:\n\n(RS + RT + ST)/3 = 48\n5 + 17 + 22 = 3(48)\n44 = 144/3\n44 = 48 - 4\n\nThis tells us that the sum of RS, RT, and ST is 4 less than three times their average. We can use this fact to find x:\n\nST = 2x = 44 + 4 = 48\nx = 24\n\nNow we can find RU:\n\nRU = 17 - x\n   = 17 - 24\n   = -7\n\nUh oh, we got another negative answer. This means that our assumption that U is not the midpoint of ST is also incorrect. What's going on?\n\nLet's take a closer look at the problem. We know that the average of temperatures at noontime from Monday to Friday is 40. This means that the sum of the temperatures is:\n\n5 x 40 = 200\n\nWe also know that the lowest temperature is 30. This means that the sum of the other four temperatures is:\n\n200 - 30 = 170\n\nWe want to find the possible maximum range of the temperatures. This means that we want to find the difference between the highest and lowest temperatures. Let's assume that the highest temperature is x. This means that the sum of the other three temperatures is:\n\n170 - 30 - x = 140 - x\n\nWe know that the average of these three temperatures is also 40. This means that their sum is:\n\n3 x 40 = 120\n\nWe can use this fact to find x:\n\nx + 140 - x = 120\n140 = 120 + x\nx = 20\n\nSo the highest temperature is 20, and the range of the temperatures is:\n\n20 - 30 = -10\n\nUh oh, we got another negative answer. What's going on?\n\nLet's think about what we're trying to find. We're trying to find the possible maximum range of the temperatures. This means that we want to find the largest possible difference between the highest and lowest temperatures. We know that the lowest temperature is 30, so the largest possible difference will occur when the highest temperature is as large as possible.\n\nWhat's the largest possible temperature? We know that the average of the temperatures is 40, so the sum of the temperatures is:\n\n5 x 40 = 200\n\nWe also know that the lowest temperature is 30, so the",

The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0.

Let's assume that the distance is x.\n\nWhen the angle of elevation is 45\u00b0, we can form a right triangle with the tower, the car, and the ground. The height of the tower is x, and the distance between the car and the tower is also x. Therefore, the base of the triangle is x\u221a2.\n\nWhen the angle of elevation is 60\u00b0, we can form another right triangle with the tower, the car, and the ground. The height of the tower is still x, and the distance between the car and the tower is now x + d, where d is the distance that the car travels in 10 minutes. Therefore, the base of the triangle is (x + d)\u221a3.\n\nWe can set up an equation using the two triangles:\n\nx\u221a2 / x + (x + d)\u221a3 / x = tan(60\u00b0) - tan(45\u00b0)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx(\u221a3 - \u221a2) = d(\u221a3 + \u221a2)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of d. We know that the car travels at a uniform speed, so we can use the formula:\n\nspeed = distance / time\n\nLet t be the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower. Then, we can set up another equation:\n\nx + d = speed * t\n\nSubstituting d with x(\u221a3 + \u221a2) / (\u221a3 - \u221a2) from the previous equation, we get:\n\nx + x(\u221a3 + \u221a2) / (\u221a3 - \u221a2) = speed * t\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nt = (x(\u221a3 + \u221a2) + x(\u221a3 - \u221a2)) / (speed * (\u221a3 - \u221a2))\n\nt = 2x\u221a3 / (speed * (\u221a3 - \u221a2))\n\nNow, we need to find the value of speed. We know that the car travels the distance x\u221a2 in 10 minutes, so we can set up another equation:\n\nspeed = x\u221a2 / 10\n\nSubstituting this value into the previous equation, we get:\n\nt = 20x\u221a3 / (x\u221a2 * (\u221a3 - \u221a2))\n\nt = 20\u221a6 / (\u221a2 * (\u221a3 - \u221a2))\n\nt = 10(\u221a3 + \u221a2)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 6(\u221a3 + \u221a2).",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the total number of boys and girls in the group. We know that the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, so we can write:\n\n4x = number of boys\n3x = number of girls\n\nwhere x is a common factor. \n\nWe also know that initially, there were 64 boys and 40 girls, so we can write:\n\n4x + 64 = total number of boys\n3x + 40 = total number of girls\n\nSince the same number of boys and girls joined the group, the total number of boys and girls in the group is:\n\n4x + 64 + 3x = 7x + 64\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the shuttle's vertical speed. We can do this by dividing the height it travels by the time it takes: \n\nVertical speed = 700m / 40s = 17.5 m/s \n\nNext, we need to find the distance it travels during the 5 seconds it takes to pass a point. We can do this by multiplying the horizontal speed by the time: \n\nDistance = horizontal speed x time = ? x 5s \n\nWe don't know the horizontal speed yet, but we can use the fact that the shuttle's path forms a right triangle with the height it travels and the distance it travels. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for the horizontal speed: \n\n(horizontal speed)^2 + (17.5 m/s)^2 = (distance)^2 \n\nWe know that the height is 700m and the time is 40s, so we can use the formula distance = speed x time to find the distance: \n\ndistance = vertical speed x time = 17.5 m/s x 40s = 700m \n\nSubstituting this into the Pythagorean theorem: \n\n(horizontal speed)^2 + (17.5 m/s)^2 = (700m)^2 \n\n(horizontal speed)^2 = (700m)^2 - (17.5 m/s)^2 \n\n(horizontal speed)^2 = 489,062.5 \n\nhorizontal speed = sqrt(489,062.5) = 700 m/s \n\nNow we can substitute this back into the formula for distance: \n\nDistance = horizontal speed x time = 700 m/s x 5s = 3500m \n\nFinally, we can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find the length of the shuttle: \n\n(length)^2 = (distance)^2 + (height)^2 \n\n(length)^2 = (3500m)^2 + (700m)^2 \n\n(length)^2 = 12,250,000 \n\nlength = sqrt(12,250,000) = 3500m / sqrt(2) \n\nlength \u2248 2475m \n\nTherefore, the length of the space shuttle is approximately 2475 meters.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the amount of zinc and copper in 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y.\n\nFor alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. This means that out of every 2+3=5 parts of the alloy, 2 parts are zinc and 3 parts are copper. So, in 40 grams of alloy X, we have:\n\n- Zinc: 40 * (2/5) = 16 grams\n- Copper: 40 * (3/5) = 24 grams\n\nSimilarly, for alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which simplifies to 1:1.57 (rounded to two decimal places). This means that out of every 1+1.57=2.57 parts of the alloy, 1 part is zinc and 1.57 parts are copper. So, in 60 grams of alloy Y, we have:\n\n- Zinc: 60 * (1/2.57) = 23.34 grams (rounded to two decimal places)\n- Copper: 60 * (1.57/2.57) = 36.66 grams (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow, we can add the amounts of zinc and copper in the two alloys to find the total amount of each in alloy Z:\n\n- Zinc: 16 + 23.34 = 39.34 grams (rounded to two decimal places)\n- Copper: 24 + 36.66 = 60.66 grams (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nFinally, we can express the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z:\n\n- Zinc to copper: 39.34 : 60.66, which simplifies to 59 : 91\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 59:91.",

This means that the time taken by the elevator to cover the remaining (S-20) steps is (10-1) = 9 minutes (since you took 1 minute to walk 20 steps). Therefore, we can write:\n\n(S-20)/E = 9\n\nSimilarly, if you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach the ground in 20 minutes.

If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the volume of the alloy coin. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = \u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Since the coin is 2 mm thick and has a diameter of 15 mm, its radius is 7.5 mm. Therefore, the volume of the coin is:\n\nV = \u03c0(7.5 mm)^2(2 mm) = 352.5 mm^3\n\nNext, we need to find the volume of aluminum in the alloy coin. Since the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, we can divide the total volume by 2 to get the volume of each metal. Therefore, the volume of aluminum is:\n\nV_aluminum = 352.5 mm^3 / 2 = 176.25 mm^3\n\nNow we can use the density of aluminum to find its weight. The density of aluminum is 2.7 g/cm^3, which is equivalent to 2.7 g/mm^3. Therefore, the weight of a pure aluminum coin with the same volume as the aluminum in the alloy coin is:\n\nW_aluminum = V_aluminum x density of aluminum = 176.25 mm^3 x 2.7 g/mm^3 = 475.125 g\n\nHowever, the weight of the silver in the alloy coin needs to be subtracted from this weight, since the new coin is made of pure aluminum. We can find the weight of the silver by subtracting the weight of the aluminum from the total weight of the alloy coin:\n\nW_silver = total weight - weight of aluminum = 30 g - (V_aluminum x density of aluminum) = 30 g - 476.25 g = -446.25 g\n\nThis negative weight for the silver doesn't make sense, so we need to check our calculations. We made an error in assuming that the density of silver is twice that of aluminum. In fact, the density of silver is about 10.5 g/cm^3, which is equivalent to 10.5 g/mm^3. Therefore, the weight of the silver in the alloy coin is:\n\nW_silver = V_silver x density of silver = V_aluminum x density of silver = 176.25 mm^3 x 10.5 g/mm^3 = 1848.375 g\n\nNow we can find the weight of the new coin by adding the weight of the aluminum and the weight of the silver:\n\nW_new = W_aluminum + W_silver = 475.125 g + 1848.375 g = 2323.5 g\n\nFinally, we need to convert this weight from grams to kilograms:\n\nW_new = 2323.5 g / 1000 = 2.3235 kg\n\nTherefore, the answer is none of the above.",

This is known as the pigeonhole principle, which states that if we have n items to put into m containers, and n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item.\n\nIn this case, we have 8 + 13 + 10 + 5 + 4 = 40 ties, and we want to find the minimum number of ties we need to take out to guarantee that we have at least two ties of the same color. Since we have 5 different colors, the worst-case scenario is that we take out one tie of each color, which gives us a total of 5 ties. However, if we take out one more tie, we will have at least two ties of the same color. Therefore, the answer is (B) 3.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nLet the rectangular solid be ABCDEFGH, where AB = 3, BC = 4, and CD = 15. Let O be the center of the sphere, and let R be the radius of the sphere. Since all eight vertices of the rectangular solid are on the sphere, O must be the midpoint of diagonal AC and diagonal EG. \n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nOA = OC = OE = OG = R (since O is the center of the sphere)\nAC = sqrt(3^2 + 15^2) = sqrt(234)\nEG = sqrt(4^2 + 15^2) = sqrt(241)\n\nSince O is the midpoint of AC and EG, we have:\n\nOA^2 + AC^2/4 = R^2\nOE^2 + EG^2/4 = R^2\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\nR^2 + 234/4 = R^2 + 241/4\n241/4 - 234/4 = 7/4 = R^2\n\nTherefore, R = sqrt(7/4) = sqrt(7)/2.\n\nThe diameter of the sphere is twice the radius, so the answer is:\n\n2R = 2(sqrt(7)/2) = sqrt(28) = 2sqrt(7) \n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) 20.8888.",
