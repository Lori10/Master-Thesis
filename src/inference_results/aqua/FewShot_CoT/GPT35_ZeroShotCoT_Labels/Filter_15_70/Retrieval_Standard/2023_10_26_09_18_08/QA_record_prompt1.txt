            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we know that when folded along one set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 48cm. This means that the length of the rectangle is twice the width plus twice the fold length. Let's call the width \"w\" and the fold length \"f\". Then we have:\n\n2w + 2f = 48\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nw + f = 24\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the other set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 66cm. This means that the width of the rectangle is twice the length plus twice the fold length. Using the same variables, we have:\n\n2l + 2f = 66\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nl + f = 33\n\nWe can now solve for \"w\" and \"l\" by adding the two equations:\n\nw + f + l + f = 24 + 33\n\nw + l + 2f = 57\n\nBut we know that the difference between the length and width is the fold length multiplied by 2. So:\n\nl - w = 2f\n\nSubstituting this into the previous equation, we get:\n\nw + (l - 2f) + 2f = 57\n\nw + l = 57\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\nw + f = 24\n\nw + l = 57\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\n\nl - f = 33\n\nBut we know that l - w = 2f, so:\n\n2f + f = 33\n\nf = 11\n\nNow we can substitute this value of \"f\" into any of the previous equations to solve for \"w\" and \"l\". Let's use the equation w + f = 24:\n\nw + 11 = 24\n\nw = 13\n\nSo the width of the rectangle is 13cm. Using the equation w + l = 57, we can solve for \"l\":\n\n13 + l = 57\n\nl = 44\n\nSo the length of the rectangle is 44cm. Finally, we can calculate the area of the rectangle:\n\nArea = length x width\n\nArea = 44 x 13\n\nArea = 572\n\nTherefore, the area of the sheet is 572 square cm.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The area of the square paper is (side)^2 = 20^2 = 400 cm^2.\n\nThe diameter of each semi-circle is equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm.\n\nThe area of each semi-circle is (1/2)\u03c0r^2, where r is the radius of the semi-circle. Since the diameter is 20 cm, the radius is 10 cm. Therefore, the area of each semi-circle is (1/2)\u03c0(10)^2 = 50\u03c0/2 = 25\u03c0 cm^2.\n\nThe total area of the two semi-circles is 2(25\u03c0) = 50\u03c0 cm^2.\n\nWhen the two semi-circles are cut out, the remaining paper is in the shape of a square with two quarter-circles removed. The side of this square is the same as the diameter of the semi-circles, which is 20 cm.\n\nThe area of the square with two quarter-circles removed is (side)^2 - 2(1/4)\u03c0r^2, where r is the radius of the semi-circle. Since the diameter is 20 cm, the radius is 10 cm. Therefore, the area of the remaining paper is 20^2 - 2(1/4)\u03c0(10)^2 = 400 - 50\u03c0/2 = 400 - 25\u03c0 cm^2.\n\nApproximating \u03c0 as 3.14, we get 400 - 25(3.14) \u2248 400 - 78.5 \u2248 321.5 cm^2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 321.5 cm^2, which is closest to option (B) 8.79.",

            "Question": "Q: There is a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. If five registered voters are chosen at random, what is the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted in the last election? Answer Choices: (A) 26.2% (B) 32.8% (C) 43.7% (D) 59.0% (E) 65.6%",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the probability that exactly four out of five registered voters voted in the last election. We can use the binomial probability formula for this:\n\nP(X = 4) = (5 choose 4) * 0.9^4 * 0.1^1\n\nwhere \"X\" is the number of registered voters who voted in the last election, \"5 choose 4\" represents the number of ways to choose 4 registered voters out of 5, and 0.9 and 0.1 are the probabilities of a registered voter voting and not voting in the last election, respectively.\n\nEvaluating this expression, we get:\n\nP(X = 4) = (5 choose 4) * 0.9^4 * 0.1^1 = 0.32805\n\nNext, we need to find the approximate likelihood that exactly four out of five registered voters voted in the last election. Since the sample size is relatively small (n = 5), we can use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. Specifically, we can use the following formula:\n\nP(X = 4) \u2248 N(\u03bc, \u03c3^2)\n\nwhere N(\u03bc, \u03c3^2) represents a normal distribution with mean \u03bc and variance \u03c3^2. The mean and variance of a binomial distribution are given by:\n\n\u03bc = n * p\n\u03c3^2 = n * p * (1 - p)\n\nwhere n is the sample size and p is the probability of success (i.e., a registered voter voting in the last election).\n\nSubstituting n = 5 and p = 0.9, we get:\n\n\u03bc = 5 * 0.9 = 4.5\n\u03c3^2 = 5 * 0.9 * 0.1 = 0.45\n\nTaking the square root of the variance, we get:\n\n\u03c3 = sqrt(0.45) = 0.671\n\nNow, we can standardize the binomial distribution using the z-score formula:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere X is the number of registered voters who voted in the last election. Substituting X = 4, \u03bc = 4.5, and \u03c3 = 0.671, we get:\n\nz = (4 - 4.5) / 0.671 = -0.746\n\nLooking up the standard normal distribution table, we find that the probability of a z-score less than or equal to -0.746 is approximately 0.2266. Since we are interested in the probability of exactly four registered voters voting in the last election, we need to subtract the probability of three or fewer registered voters voting in the last election from this value. Using the binomial probability formula again, we can find this probability:\n\nP(X \u2264 3) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3)\n\n= 0.1^5 + (5 choose 1) * 0.9^1 * 0.1^4 + (5 choose 2) * 0.9^2 * 0.1^3 + (5 choose 3) * 0.9^3 * 0.1^2\n\n= 0.00001 + 0.00045 + 0.0081 + 0.0729\n\n= 0.08146\n\nSubtracting this value from 0.2266, we get:\n\n0.2266 - 0.08146 = 0.14514\n\nTherefore, the approximate likelihood that exactly four out of five registered voters voted in the last election is 14.514%, which is closest to answer choice (B) 32.8%.",

After they joined, the total number of boys and girls in the group is:\n\n60 + y boys\n45 + y girls\n\nWe also know that the ratio of boys to girls is still 4:3, so we can write:\n\n(60 + y)/ (45 + y) = 4/3\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n180 + 3y = 240 + 4y\n\nSolving for y, we get:\n\ny = 60\n\nTherefore, the total number of members in the group now is:\n\n60 + 60 + 45 = 165\n\nSo the answer is not in the answer choices. Therefore, the answer is \"None of the above\".",

If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ? Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The first step is to find the amount of zinc and copper in 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y.\n\nFor alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. This means that for every 2 parts of zinc, there are 3 parts of copper. So, we can find the amount of zinc and copper in 40 grams of alloy X as follows:\n\n- Let the amount of zinc in 40 grams of alloy X be 2x.\n- Then, the amount of copper in 40 grams of alloy X is 3x.\n- Since the total weight of alloy X is 40 grams, we have:\n\n2x + 3x = 40\n5x = 40\nx = 8\n\nSo, the amount of zinc in 40 grams of alloy X is 2x = 16 grams, and the amount of copper is 3x = 24 grams.\n\nSimilarly, for alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which simplifies to 1:1.57 (approximately). This means that for every 1 part of zinc, there are 1.57 parts of copper. So, we can find the amount of zinc and copper in 60 grams of alloy Y as follows:\n\n- Let the amount of zinc in 60 grams of alloy Y be y.\n- Then, the amount of copper in 60 grams of alloy Y is 1.57y.\n- Since the total weight of alloy Y is 60 grams, we have:\n\ny + 1.57y = 60\n2.57y = 60\ny = 23.3 (approximately)\n\nSo, the amount of zinc in 60 grams of alloy Y is y = 23.3 grams (approximately), and the amount of copper is 1.57y = 36.6 grams (approximately).\n\nNow, we can find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z by adding the amounts from alloy X and alloy Y:\n\n- Total amount of zinc = 16 + 23.3 = 39.3 grams (approximately)\n- Total amount of copper = 24 + 36.6 = 60.6 grams (approximately)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is approximately 39.3:60.6, which simplifies to 131:202.

Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the total number of steps in the staircase is 'x'. \n\nLet's also assume that the speed of the elevator is 's' steps/minute. \n\nAccording to the problem, if you walk 20 steps and stop, you reach the bottom in 10 minutes. This means that the time taken by the elevator to cover the remaining (x-20) steps is (10 minutes - the time taken by you to walk 20 steps). \n\nSo, the time taken by the elevator to cover (x-20) steps is (10 - 20/60) minutes = 9 1/3 minutes = 28/3 minutes. \n\nSimilarly, if you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach the bottom in 20 minutes. This means that the time taken by the elevator to cover the remaining (x-10) steps is (20 minutes - the time taken by you to walk 10 steps). \n\nSo, the time taken by the elevator to cover (x-10) steps is (20 - 10/60) minutes = 19 1/3 minutes = 58/3 minutes. \n\nNow, we can use the formula: \n\nSpeed = Distance/Time \n\nLet's consider the distance covered by the elevator in both cases: \n\nIn the first case, the elevator covers (x-20) steps in 28/3 minutes. \n\nIn the second case, the elevator covers (x-10) steps in 58/3 minutes. \n\nSo, we can write: \n\ns = (x-20)/(28/3) = 3(x-20)/28 \n\ns = (x-10)/(58/3) = 3(x-10)/58 \n\nEquating both the expressions of 's', we get: \n\n3(x-20)/28 = 3(x-10)/58 \n\nSolving this equation, we get: \n\nx = 116 \n\nSubstituting this value of 'x' in any of the expressions of 's', we get: \n\ns = 3(116-20)/28 = 3(96)/28 = 36/7 \n\nSo, the speed of the elevator is approximately 5.14 steps/minute, which is closest to option (E) None of the above.",

If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the volume of the coin made of aluminum and silver. The volume of a cylinder (which is the shape of the coin) is given by the formula V = \u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. In this case, the radius is half of the diameter, so r = 7.5 mm. The height is 2 mm. Therefore, the volume of the coin is:\n\nV = \u03c0(7.5 mm)^2(2 mm) = 352.7 mm^3\n\nSince the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, we can divide the volume by 2 to get the volume of each metal:\n\nV_aluminum = V_silver = 176.4 mm^3\n\nNext, we need to find the weight of the aluminum in the coin. We know that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, so the weight of the silver in the coin is twice that of the aluminum. Let's call the weight of the aluminum x. Then the weight of the silver is 2x. The total weight of the coin is 30 grams, so we can write:\n\nx + 2x = 30\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n3x = 30\n\nx = 10\n\nTherefore, the weight of the aluminum in the coin is 10 grams, and the weight of the silver is 20 grams.\n\nNow we can find the density of the aluminum in the coin:\n\ndensity_aluminum = mass_aluminum / volume_aluminum\n\nmass_aluminum = 10 grams (from above)\n\nvolume_aluminum = 176.4 mm^3 (from above)\n\nWe need to convert the volume to cubic centimeters (cc) and the mass to grams/cc:\n\nvolume_aluminum = 176.4 mm^3 = 0.1764 cc\n\nmass_aluminum = 10 grams\n\ndensity_aluminum = 10 / 0.1764 = 56.6 grams/cc\n\nFinally, we can find the weight of a pure aluminum coin with the same volume as the original coin. The volume of the new coin is:\n\nV_new = \u03c0r^2h = \u03c0(15 mm/2)^2(1 mm) = 176.7 mm^3\n\nWe need to find the mass of aluminum that has this volume. The density of aluminum is 56.6 grams/cc, so the mass is:\n\nmass_new = density_aluminum x V_new = 56.6 x 0.1767 = 10 grams (approximately)\n\nTherefore, the weight of the new coin is 10 grams.
