Answer Choices: (A) 1 : 2 : 3 (B) 3 : 2 : 1 (C) 4 : 2 : 3 (D) 2 : 4 : 7 (E) none of these\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can simplify the second ratio by cross-multiplying to get z(y + x) = (y)(y + x), which simplifies to y^2 = zx. Next, we can substitute this expression for y^2 into the first ratio to get y/(x - z) = (y + x)/z = x/zx^(1/2). Simplifying this expression, we get y = x^(3/2)/(x - z) and z = x^(1/2)/(x - z). Now, we can substitute these expressions for y and z into the ratio y^2 : x : z to get x^(3/2)/(x - z)^2 : x : x^(1/2)/(x - z). Simplifying this expression, we get x^(5/2) : x(x - z)^2 : x^(3/2)(x - z). Cancelling out an x from each term, we get x^(3/2) : (x - z)^2 : x^(1/2). Now, we can substitute the expression for z from earlier (z = x^(1/2)/(x - z)) into this ratio to get x^(3/2) : (x - x^(1/2))^2 : x^(1/2). Simplifying this expression, we get x^(3/2) : (x^2 - 2x^(3/2) + x) : x^(1/2). Finally, we can simplify the middle term by expanding the square and combining like terms to get x^(3/2) : (x^2 - 2x^(3/2) + x) : x^(1/2) = x^(3/2) : (x^2 - x^(3/2)) : x^(1/2) = x^(1/2) : (x - 1) : 1. Therefore, the answer is (E) none of these, since none of the given answer choices match the ratio x^(1/2) : (x - 1) : 1. The answer is E.\n\nQ: The average of temperatures at noontime from Monday to Friday is 40; the lowest one is 30, what is the possible maximum range of the temperatures? Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 25 (C) 50 (D) 45 (E) 75\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We know that the average temperature from Monday to Friday is 40. Let's call the sum of the temperatures for those five days \"S\". Then we can write: S/5 = 40 Multiplying both sides by 5, we get: S = 200 We also know that the lowest temperature is 30. Let's call the highest temperature \"H\". Then the range of temperatures is: H - 30 To find the maximum possible range, we need to find the maximum possible value of H. We know that the sum of the temperatures is 200, so: H + 4(40) = 200 Simplifying, we get: H = 40 So the maximum range of temperatures is: 40 - 30 = 10 Therefore, the answer is (A) 20. The answer is A.\n\nQ: Two taps can separately fill a cistern 10 minutes and 15 minutes respectively and when the waste pipe is open, they can together fill it in 18 minutes. The waste pipe can empty the full cistern in? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 6 (C) 7 (D) 9 (E) 1\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the capacity of the cistern be C. The rate of filling of the first tap is C/10 per minute. The rate of filling of the second tap is C/15 per minute. When both taps are open, their combined rate of filling is C/18 per minute. Let the rate of emptying of the waste pipe be W (in terms of the capacity of the cistern per minute). According to the problem, when all three are open, the net rate of filling is zero (since the waste pipe is emptying the cistern at the same time). So, we can write the equation: C/10 + C/15 - C/18 = W Multiplying through by the LCM of the denominators (which is 90), we get: 9C + 6C - 5C = 90W Simplifying, we get: 10C = 90W Dividing by 10, we get: C = 9W This means that the waste pipe can empty the full cistern in 9 minutes (since it empties 1/9th of the cistern per minute). Therefore, the answer is (D) 9. The answer is D.\n\nQ: If money is invested at r percent interest, compounded annually, the amount of the investment will double in approximately 50/r years. If Luke's parents invested $15,500 in a long term bond that pays 12 percent interest compounded annually, what will be the approximate total amount of the investment 12 years later, when Luke is ready for college? Answer Choices: (A) 62,000 (B) 85,500 (C) 95,500 (D) 100,500 (E) 120,000\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many times the investment will double in 12 years. Using the formula given in the problem, we can calculate that the investment will double approximately every 4.17 years (50/12). Therefore, the investment will double approximately 2.88 times (12/4.17). Next, we need to calculate the final amount of the investment after 12 years. To do this, we can use the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) Where: A = final amount P = principal (initial investment) r = annual interest rate (as a decimal) n = number of times interest is compounded per year t = time (in years) Plugging in the given values, we get: A = 15500(1 + 0.12/1)^(1*12) A = 15500(1.12)^12 A \u2248 55,500 Finally, we need to multiply this amount by the number of times the investment doubled: 55,500 * 2.88 \u2248 159,840 Therefore, the approximate total amount of the investment 12 years later is $159,840. None of the answer choices provided match this result. The answer is A.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step."

            "Question": "Q: Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the jar has a total of 10 candies (just to make the calculations easier). We can use the formula: Work = Rate x Time Let P's rate of eating candies be R1 (in candies per minute) and Q's rate of eating candies be R2 (in candies per minute). When they eat together, their combined rate of eating candies is R1 + R2 (in candies per minute). We know that: P takes 10 minutes to eat 10 candies, so his rate is R1 = 10/10 = 1 candy per minute. Q takes 5 minutes to eat 5 candies (half the jar), so her rate is R2 = 5/5 = 1 candy per minute. Now, we need to find the combined rate of eating candies when they eat together. To do this, we can use the fact that they can empty the jar together, so their combined rate is 1 jar / 10 minutes = (R1 + R2) jars per minute. Therefore, we can write: 1/10 = R1 + R2 We also know that Q can eat half the jar in 5 minutes, so her rate is R2 = 1/5. Substituting this into the first equation, we get: 1/10 = R1 + 1/5 Simplifying, we get: R1 = 1/10 - 1/5 = -1/10 (which is negative, but it just means that P is eating slower than Q, so Q is doing most of the work). Now, we can use the formula Work = Rate x Time to find the time it takes them to empty the jar when they eat together. Let T be the time it takes them to empty the jar. Then we can write: 10 = (R1 + R2)T Substituting the values we found earlier, we get: 10 = (-1/10 + 1/5)T Simplifying, we get: T = 10 / (1/10) = 100 minutes Therefore, it would take them 100 minutes to empty the jar when they eat together.

If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's call the number of grams of the health food that must be eaten daily \"x\". We know that one gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. Therefore, the amount of vitamin E obtained from x grams of the health food is: 0.09x The amount of vitamin A obtained from x grams of the health food is: 0.08x We want to find the value of x that makes both of these amounts at least equal to the minimum daily requirement of their respective vitamins. Let's call the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E \"E\" and the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A \"A\". Then we can write the following two equations: 0.09x \u2265 E 0.08x \u2265 A We want to find the smallest value of x that satisfies both of these equations. To do this, we can divide both sides of each equation by the respective percentage (0.09 for vitamin E and 0.08 for vitamin A): x \u2265 E/0.09 x \u2265 A/0.08 We want the smallest value of x that satisfies both of these inequalities, so we can take the larger of the two values: x \u2265 max(E/0.09, A/0.08) Plugging in the given values for E and A, we get: x \u2265 max(1/0.09, 1/0.08) x \u2265 max(11.11, 12.5) x \u2265 12.5 Therefore, the smallest number of grams of the health food that must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is 12.5.

Let's call the total number of microwave ovens sold last year \"L\" and the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months of this year \"F\". Then we can write: L/12 = 42 (since the average for last year was 42) F/10 = 20 (since the average for the first 10 months of this year was 20) We want to find the average for the entire 22 months, which we can call \"A\". Then we can write: A/22 = (L + F)/22 (since the total number of microwave ovens sold over the entire 22 months is the sum of the number sold last year and the number sold in the first 10 months of this year) Multiplying both sides by 22, we get: A = L + F Substituting the given values, we get: A = 42*12 + 20*10 A = 504 + 200 A = 704 Therefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period is 704/22 \u2248 32.

We want to find the time at which both balls will be at the same starting point again. This will happen when both balls have completed an integer number of rotations. Let's call the number of rotations completed by ball A \"Na\" and the number of rotations completed by ball B \"Nb\".

Substituting in the values for Ta and Tb, we get: 13Na = 7k Solving for Na, we get: Na = (7/13)k Since Na must be a positive integer, the smallest possible value of k that makes Na an integer is k = 13. Therefore, Na = 7 and Nb = 13 (since Nb = NaTa/Tb). The time it takes for both balls to be at the same starting point again is equal to the time it takes for both balls to complete an integer number of rotations, which is equal to the LCM of the number of rotations completed by each ball times the period of rotation for each ball.

Therefore, the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1000 is: 1 - (1/2 + 1/5 - 1/10) = 1 - 7/20 = 13/20.

Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's start by finding the fraction of the job that each painter can do in one day. Mr. Brown can do 1/6 of the job in one day, Mr. Black can do 1/8 of the job in one day, and Mr. Blue can do 1/12 of the job in one day. \n\nAfter 8 days, Mr. Brown has completed 8/6 = 4/3 of the job, Mr. Black has completed 8/8 = 1 of the job, and Mr. Blue has completed 8/12 = 2/3 of the job. \n\nTogether, they have completed 4/3 + 1 + 2/3 = 4/3 + 3/3 = 7/3 of the job in 8 days. \n\nThis means that there is 1 - 7/3 = 2/3 of the job left to be done. \n\nMr. Black works alone for 6 more days, which means he completes 6/8 = 3/4 of the remaining job. \n\nThis leaves 2/3 - 3/4 = -1/12 of the job left to be done. \n\nSince this is a nonsensical result, we must have made an error in our calculations.

Answer Choices: (A) 43 seconds (B) 39 seconds (C) 20 seconds (D) 33 seconds (E) 55 seconds",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to convert the speed of the train from miles per hour to miles per second, since the time given for entering the tunnel is in seconds. To do this, we can divide 120 by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour): 120/3600 = 1/30 miles per second Next, we can use the formula: distance = rate x time to find the distance the train travels while completely passing through the tunnel. Since the tunnel is 1 mile long, the total distance the train travels is 2 miles (1 mile to enter the tunnel and 1 mile to exit the tunnel). Therefore, we can write: 2 = (1/30) x time Solving for time, we get: time = 60 seconds Therefore, it will take the train 60 seconds to completely pass through the tunnel.

Using the formula for compound interest, we can calculate the amount after 2 years as: 5000 * (1 + r/100)^2. The difference between the compound interest and simple interest is given as Rs. 72. Therefore, we can write the equation: 5000 * (1 + r/100)^2 - 5000 - 100r = 72 Simplifying, we get: 5000 * (1 + r/100)^2 - 100r = 5072 Expanding the square, we get: 5000 * (1 + 2r/100 + r^2/10000) - 100r = 5072 Simplifying, we get: 5000 + 100r + 5r^2 - 100r = 5072 Simplifying further, we get: 5r^2 = 72 Solving for r, we get: r = 6 Therefore, the rate of interest is 6%.

We can solve for y in equation 2: y = n - x. We can substitute this expression for y into equation 1: \n\n0.20x + 0.25(n - x) = 3.40 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n0.05x + 0.25n = 3.40 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 20 to eliminate the decimal, we get: \n\nx + 4n = 68 \n\nWe want to minimize x, so we want to maximize n.

Substituting n = 5 into the equation above, we get: \n\nx + 20 = 68 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx = 48 \n\nThis means that the diver brought up 48 copper coins and 5 - 48 = -43 brass coins, which is not possible. \n\nThe next smallest possible value of n is 6.

When we cut this rectangle in half diagonally, we get two right triangles with legs x-4 and x/2.

Let's call the number of helpers needed to make the large cakes \"L\" and the number of helpers needed to make the small cakes \"S\". Then we can write two equations based on the number of cakes needed: 2L + 35S = 700 (for the small cakes) L = 20 (for the large cakes) Solving the second equation, we get L = 20. Substituting this into the first equation, we get: 2(20) + 35S = 700 Simplifying, we get: 35S = 660 Dividing both sides by 35, we get: S = 18.86 (rounded to two decimal places) Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we need 19 helpers to make the small cakes. Since each helper can make either 6 large cakes or 105 small cakes in 3 hours, we need to figure out how many helpers we need to make 20 large cakes in 3 hours. Each helper can make 6/20 = 0.3 large cakes in 3 hours. Therefore, we need 20/0.3 = 66.67 (rounded up to 67) helpers to make the large cakes.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's call the number of bouquets we can make \"B\". We want to maximize B. Each bouquet must have the same number of red tulips and the same number of white tulips. Let's call the number of red and white tulips in each bouquet \"r\" and \"w\", respectively. Then we can write: r + w = total number of tulips = 28 + 98 = 126 We want to maximize B, which means we want to minimize r and w. One way to do this is to make r and w as close to each other as possible. Since r and w must be integers, the best we can do is to make them differ by 1. So we can write: r = w + 1 Substituting this into the first equation, we get: w + 1 + w = 126 Simplifying, we get: 2w + 1 = 126 Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get: 2w = 125 Dividing by 2, we get: w = 62.5 This is not an integer, which means we made a mistake somewhere. The mistake is in assuming that r and w must be integers. In fact, we can have non-integer values of r and w as long as they add up to 126. For example, we could have r = 63.5 and w = 62.5. Then we could make one bouquet with 63 red tulips and 62 white tulips, and another bouquet with 63 red tulips and 64 white tulips. These two bouquets are identical according to the definition given in the problem. We can continue making identical bouquets in this way until we run out of tulips. Since we have 98 red tulips, we can make a maximum of 98/2 = 49 identical bouquets. Therefore, the answer is (E) 21. The answer is E.",

Similarly, Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so his rate is 1/9 toys per hour. Let's call the number of hours they each work \"t\".

We also know that 28% of the students took math, so the number of students who took math is 0.28N. We want to find the least possible value of N that satisfies these conditions. Since we know that there are more than 501 students in the school, we can start by trying answer choice (A) 550. If there are 550 students in the school, then the number of students who took physics is 0.2(550) = 110, and the number of students who took math is 0.28(550) = 154. The total number of students who took either physics or math is 110 + 154 = 264. However, this is less than 501, so we can eliminate answer choice (A). Trying answer choice (B) 570, we get: Number of students who took physics = 0.2(570) = 114 Number of students who took math = 0.28(570) = 159 Total number of students who took either physics or math = 114 + 159 = 273 This is still less than 501, so we can eliminate answer choice (B).

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's call the length of the rectangle \"l\" and the width \"w\". When folded along the length, each part has a perimeter of 48cm, so the length of each part is 24cm (since there are two equal parts). This means that the width of each part is (48 - 2*24)/2 = 0cm. This doesn't make sense, so we know that we made a mistake. Let's try folding along the width instead. When folded along the width, each part has a perimeter of 66cm, so the width of each part is 33/2 = 16.5cm. This means that the length of each part is (66 - 2*16.5)/2 = 16.5cm. Therefore, the original length and width of the rectangle are both twice the length and width of each part, so: l = 2*16.5 = 33cm w = 2*16.5 = 33cm The area of the rectangle is: A = l*w = 33*33 = 1089cm^2 Therefore, the answer is not one of the given answer choices.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's call the distance from A to C \"x\" and the distance from C to B \"y\". We know that Ram and Krishna are traveling towards each other, so their combined speed is 20 m/s + 40 m/s = 60 m/s. We also know that they meet at point C after 10 seconds. This means that the total distance they traveled is equal to their combined speed multiplied by the time they traveled: 60 m/s * 10 s = 600 m. We can also write two equations based on the distances traveled by Ram and Krishna: x = 20 m/s * t and y = 40 m/s * t, where \"t\" is the time it takes for each of them to reach point C. Since they both reach point C at the same time, we can set these two equations equal to each other: 20 m/s * t = 40 m/s * t. Simplifying, we get: t = x/20 = y/40. We can use this equation to eliminate \"t\" from the equation for the total distance: x/20 + y/40 = 10. Multiplying both sides by 40, we get: 2x + y = 400. We also know that the total distance from A to B is equal to x + y, so we can substitute the equation we just found to get: x + y = (2x + y) - x = 400 - x. Therefore, the total distance from A to B is 400 - x. We still need to find \"x\" to solve the problem. To do this, we can use the equation x/20 + y/40 = 10 and substitute y = 400 - x to get: x/20 + (400 - x)/40 = 10. Multiplying both sides by 40, we get: 2x + 400 - x = 400. Simplifying, we get: x = 200. Therefore, the total distance from A to B is 400 - x = 200 meters. Therefore, the answer is (E) 600 meters. The answer is E.",

At time t, Train M has been traveling for t - 2 hours (since it left City A at 5 am) and Train N has been traveling for 3.5 - (t - 7) hours (since it left City B at 7 am). Since the two trains meet each other, the sum of their distances traveled is equal to the distance between City A and City B. Let's call this distance D. The distance traveled by Train M is given by the formula: distance = rate x time Since Train M travels at a constant rate, we can write: distance = rate x (t - 2) The distance traveled by Train N is given by the formula: distance = rate x time Since Train N travels at a constant rate, we can write: distance = rate x (3.5 - (t - 7)) Adding the two distances together, we get: rate x (t - 2) + rate x (3.5 - (t - 7)) = D Simplifying, we get: rate x (2t - 9) = D Solving for t, we get: t = (D + 9rate)/2rate We don't know the exact value of D or the rate of the trains, but we do know that the answer will be less than 1 hour (since Train N departs City B at 7 am and arrives at City A at 10:30 am, which is 3.5 hours later).

The LCM of 16, 10, and 8 is 80, so we need to find the largest multiple of 80 that is less than or equal to 992. This is 960 (12*80).

Let's call the amount of wheat in the bag \"W\" and the amount of corn \"C\". Then we can write: 2/10 = 3/10 = 5/10 (since the sum of the parts in the ratio is 2 + 3 + 5 = 10) Let's use the fact that the ratio of rice to wheat to corn is 2:3:5 to set up an equation involving the amount of rice and the amount of corn: 2/5 = 3/W = 3/(3 + C) (since the amount of wheat is 3 times the amount of rice, and the amount of corn is 5 times the amount of rice) Cross-multiplying the second and third terms, we get: 2(3 + C) = 5(3) 6 + 2C = 15 Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get: 2C = 9 Dividing both sides by 2, we get: C = 4.5 Therefore, the bag of the mixture contains 4.5 pounds of corn.

We also know that three rolls contain \"F\" falafel, and five baguettes contain \"F\" falafel. So we can write: 3R = 5B where R is the amount of falafel in one roll, and B is the amount of falafel in one baguette. Finally, we know that two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as some number of pita breads. Let's call that number \"x\".

In that time, Allen covers a distance of 54t km and Bob covers a distance of 78t km. When they meet for the first time, the total distance covered by both of them is d km. Therefore, we can write the equation: 54t + 78t = d ... (1) When they meet for the second time, Allen has covered a distance of 2d km (since he has gone from X to Y and back to X) and Bob has covered a distance of 2d + 48 km (since he has gone from Y to X and back to Y, and has covered an additional 48 km).

Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 81 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) None",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's call the length of the parking space L and the width W. We know that one of the sides (the width) is unpainted and has a length of 9 feet. We also know that the sum of the lengths of the other three sides (two lengths and one width) is 37 feet. So we can write the equation: 2L + W = 37 We can solve this equation for W by subtracting 2L from both sides: W = 37 - 2L We also know that the area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = LW. Substituting the expression for W that we just found, we get: A = L(37 - 2L) Simplifying, we get: A = 37L - 2L^2 To find the maximum area, we need to find the value of L that maximizes this expression. One way to do this is to complete the square: A = -2(L^2 - (37/2)L + (37/4)) + (37/2)^2 + (37/4) A = -2(L - 37/4)^2 + 729/4 The maximum value of this expression occurs when (L - 37/4)^2 = 0, which happens when L = 37/4. Substituting this value of L into the expression for A, we get: A = 37(37/4) - 2(37/4)^2 A = 126.875 Therefore, the area of the parking space is approximately 126.875 square feet.

Since x and y are positive real numbers, [2x] and [2y] are non-negative even integers. Therefore, we can write: [2x] = 2[a] and [2y] = 2[b] for some non-negative integers a and b. Now, let's compare L(x,y) and R(x,y): L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x+y] R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] = 2[a] + 2[b] = 2[a+b] Therefore, we need to find two positive real numbers x and y such that: [x] + [y] + [x+y] = 2[a+b] We can rewrite this equation as: [x] + [y] + [x+y] \u2264 2[a+b] < [x] + [y] + [x+y] + 1 Using the inequalities we derived earlier, we can substitute the upper and lower bounds for [x+y] to get: [x] + [y] + [x]+[y] \u2264 2[a+b] < [x] + [y] + [x]+[y]+1 Simplifying, we get: 2[x] + 2[y] \u2264 2[a+b] < 2[x] + 2[y] + 1 Dividing by 2, we get: [x] + [y] \u2264 a+b < [x] + [y] + 1 Now, let's consider the possible cases: Case 1: [x] + [y] = a+b In this case, we have L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x+y] = 2[a+b] = R(x,y) Therefore, the answer is (A) L(x,y) = R(x,y).

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's call the weight of the heavy duty truck \"x\". We know that the average weight of the 10 vehicles before the truck was added was 12.2 tons, so the total weight of those 10 vehicles was 10(12.2) = 122 tons. After the truck was added, the average weight increased by 2.6 tons, so the new average weight is 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons. We also know that there are now 11 vehicles in the group. Let's call the total weight of all 11 vehicles \"T\". Then we can write: T/11 = 14.8 Multiplying both sides by 11, we get: T = 11(14.8) = 162.8 tons We can also write an equation for the total weight of the 10 original vehicles plus the weight of the new truck: 122 + x = T Substituting the value we found for T, we get: 122 + x = 162.8 Subtracting 122 from both sides, we get: x = 40.8 Therefore, the weight of the heavy duty truck is 40.8 tons.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's call the total number of staplers produced on Monday \"T\". We know that 10% of these staplers were defective, so the number of defective staplers is 0.1T. This means that the number of non-defective staplers is 0.9T. We also know that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Let's call the number of non-defective staplers that were not rejected \"N\". Then we can write: N - 0.02N = 0.98N = 0.9T - 72 Simplifying, we get: N = (0.9T - 72)/0.98 We want to find the value of T. We can use the fact that the total number of staplers produced is the sum of the number of defective staplers and the number of non-defective staplers: T = 0.1T + 0.9T Substituting the expression for N that we found earlier, we get: T = 0.1T + (0.9T - 72)/0.98 Multiplying through by the denominator, we get: 0.98T = 0.1T*0.98 + 0.9T - 72 Simplifying, we get: 0.98T = 0.098T + 0.9T - 72 0.882T = 72 T \u2248 81.63 Therefore, the number of staplers produced on Monday was approximately 81.63, which is not one of the answer choices.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that there are 100 students at Daifu university. Then, according to the problem, 24 students are members of both the chess club and the swim team. Let's call the number of students who are only members of the swim team \"S\" and the number of students who are only members of the chess club \"C\". Then we can write: S + C + 24 = 100 Simplifying, we get: S + C = 76 Next, we know that 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club. Let's call the total number of members of the swim team \"T\". Then we can write: 0.2T = S Solving for S, we get: S = 0.2T Now we can substitute this expression for S into the equation we derived earlier: 0.2T + C = 76 Solving for T, we get: T = 380/3 \u2248 126.67 Therefore, the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team is: T/100 * 100% = 126.67/100 * 100% \u2248 127% This answer is not one of the answer choices provided.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's start by assigning variables to the cost of a soda and the cost of an energy bar. Let's call the cost of a soda \"s\" and the cost of an energy bar \"e\". Then we can write two equations based on the given information: \n\n1. s + 2e = 150 (one soda and two energy bars cost 150 cents)\n2. 2s + 3e = 300 (two sodas and three energy bars cost 300 cents)\n\nWe want to find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars. Using the equations above, we can solve for s and e and then plug in those values to find the total cost. \n\nTo solve for s and e, we can use elimination. Multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting it from the second equation, we get: \n\n2s + 3e - 2s - 4e = 300 - 300 \n-e = -150 \ne = 150 \n\nNow that we know e = 150, we can substitute that value into either equation to solve for s. Let's use the first equation: \n\ns + 2e = 150 \ns + 2(150) = 150 \ns + 300 = 150 \ns = -150 \n\nUh oh, we got a negative value for s! This means that there is no solution that satisfies both equations. We made an error somewhere along the way. Let's check our work: \n\n2s + 3e = 300 \n2(-150) + 3(150) = 300 \n-300 + 450 = 300 \n150 = 300 \n\nAh, we made an error in the first equation. It should be: \n\n2s + e = 150 \n\nLet's try solving again: \n\n2s + e = 150 \n2s + 3e = 300 \n\nMultiplying the first equation by 3 and subtracting it from the second equation, we get: \n\n2s + 3e - 6s - 3e = 300 - 450 \n-4s = -150 \ns = 37.5 \n\nNow that we know s = 37.5 and e = 150, we can find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars: \n\n6s + 7e = 6(37.5) + 7(150) = 225 + 1050 = 1275 \n\nTherefore, the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 1275 cents, which is not one of the answer choices.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's call the price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine \"x\". We know that the cost of the sewing machine to Karan is Rs. 1200. We also know that Karan wants to make a 20% profit on the selling price, even after offering a 20% discount. This means that Karan wants to sell the sewing machine for 80% of the marked price, but still make a 20% profit on the selling price. We can set up the equation: 1.2(0.8x) = 1200 Simplifying, we get: 0.96x = 1200 Dividing by 0.96, we get: x = 1250 Therefore, Karan should mark the sewing machine at Rs. 1250 to make a 20% profit, even after offering a 20% discount.

Solving for x, we get: 0.10x = 5 x = 50 So we can travel 50 quarter-miles for $5. Adding the first quarter-mile that costs $3.50, we can travel a total of 51 quarter-miles for $8.50.

Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's call the distance between A and B \"d\". We know that Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, so the time it took him to travel from A to B is d/70. We also know that he turned around and drove back to A at a constant speed of 90 mph, so the time it took him to travel from B to A is also d/90. Therefore, the total time for the round trip is: d/70 + d/90 + pause time We don't know the pause time, so let's call it \"t\". We know that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. This means that he had already traveled a distance of d - 70 miles. We can use this information to set up an equation: (d - 70)/90 + t = (d/70) - 3 Simplifying this equation, we get: d/90 - 7/9 + t = d/70 - 3 Multiplying both sides by the LCM of the denominators (which is 630), we get: 7d + 630t = 810d - 1890 Simplifying, we get: 803d = 630t + 1890 Solving for d, we get: d = (630/803)t + (1890/803) We know that d is a positive distance, so t must be positive as well. We also know that d is an integer (since it represents a distance), so t must be a multiple of 803/630 (since (630/803)t is a fraction). The smallest positive multiple of 803/630 is 1, so let's set t = 803/630. Plugging this value of t into the equation for d, we get: d = (630/803)(803/630) + (1890/803) d = 3 + 2.35 d \u2248 5.35 Therefore, the distance between A and B is approximately 5.35 times the common unit of distance used in the problem (e.g. miles, kilometers, etc.).

We can substitute these expressions into the equation M - N + 396c = 990 and simplify: (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990 99a - 99c + 397c = 990 99a + 298c = 990 Dividing both sides by 1, we get: a + 3c = 10 Now we can use this equation to find all possible values of a and c that satisfy the condition a > c and M > 300. Since a and c are digits, we know that 1 \u2264 c \u2264 9 and 1 \u2264 a \u2264 9. We can start by trying c = 1: If c = 1, then a + 3 = 10, so a = 7. This gives us the value M = 710. Since M > 300, this is a valid solution. If c = 2, then a + 6 = 10, so a = 4. This gives us the value M = 420. Since M > 300, this is a valid solution. If c = 3, then a + 9 = 10, which is not possible since a must be a digit between 1 and 9. If c = 4, then a + 12 = 10, which is not possible for the same reason. If c = 5, then a + 15 = 10, which is not possible. If c = 6, then a + 18 = 10, which is not possible. If c = 7, then a + 21 = 10, which is not possible. If c = 8, then a + 24 = 10, which is not possible. If c = 9, then a + 27 = 10, which is not possible. Therefore, the only valid solutions are M = 710 and M = 420.

The total length of fencing she needs is therefore: 2x + y We know that one side of the yard is 10 meters, so the other two sides must add up to the total length of the yard minus 10 meters: 2y = (x - 10) Solving for y, we get: y = (x - 10)/2 Substituting this expression for y into the equation for the area of the yard, we get: x(x - 10)/2 = 240 Multiplying both sides by 2 and simplifying, we get: x^2 - 10x - 480 = 0 Factoring the left side, we get: (x - 30)(x + 16) = 0 Since the length of the yard cannot be negative, we can ignore the solution x = -16. Therefore, the length of the yard is x = 30 meters.

To find out how many minutes it will take y gallons to pass through the drain, we need to divide y gallons by the rate at which the liquid passes through the drain. We can convert the rate from gallons per second to gallons per minute by multiplying by 60, so the rate is w/25x * 60 = 12w/5x gallons per minute. Therefore, the time it will take for y gallons to pass through the drain is: y / (12w/5x) = 5xy / 12w. Therefore, the answer is (C) 5xy/(12w). The answer is C.",

The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 10% (C) 12.5% (D) 16.7% (E) 25%",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's start by calculating the cost per year of the new tires. Since the tires last for four years, the cost per year is: (2 * $180) / 4 = $90 per year. Now let's calculate the cost per year of repairing the current tires. Since the repair costs $40 and makes the tires last for one additional year, the cost per year is: $40 / 1 = $40 per year. To find the percent difference between the two costs, we can use the formula: percent difference = |(new cost - old cost) / old cost| * 100% Plugging in the values, we get: percent difference = |($90 - $40) / $40| * 100% percent difference = |$50 / $40| * 100% percent difference = 1.25 * 100% percent difference = 125% Therefore, the average cost per year of the new tires is 125% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The outer surface of the cube consists of the 6 faces of the larger cube, each with an area of 5x5 = 25 square cm. Since the thickness of the cube is 1 cm, the inner cube has dimensions 3x3x3, and consists of 27 unit cubes. The number of faces of the unit cubes that are not painted is equal to the total number of faces minus the number of painted faces. Each unit cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces is 27x6 = 162. The number of painted faces is equal to the number of faces on the outer surface of the larger cube that are covered by the smaller cubes. Since the thickness of the cube is 1 cm, each edge of the inner cube is 2 cm shorter than the corresponding edge of the outer cube. Therefore, the number of faces on the outer surface of the larger cube that are covered by the smaller cubes is equal to (5x5 - 3x3)x6 = 72. Therefore, the number of faces of the unit cubes that are not painted is 162 - 72 = 90. However, we have counted the faces of the unit cubes that are adjacent to the faces of the larger cube twice (once for each adjacent unit cube). There are 4 such faces for each edge of the larger cube, and there are 12 edges, so the total number of faces that are adjacent to the faces of the larger cube is 4x12 = 48. Therefore, the number of faces of the unit cubes that are not painted is 90 - 48 = 42. However, we have also counted the 8 corner cubes three times (once for each adjacent face of the larger cube).

Let J be Joe's current age, S be his sister's current age, and F be his father's current age. We know that J + S + F = 100. \n\nNext, we know that when Joe is as old as his father, his sister will be twice as old as she is now. Let's call this future age T. Then we have:\n\nJ + T + F = 100 (since the sum of their ages is still 100)\nT = 2S (since his sister will be twice as old as she is now)\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first, we get:\n\nJ + 2S + F = 100\n\nNow, we know that when Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as his sister was when she was as old as her father. Let's call this age X. Then we have:\n\nJ + X = F (since Joe will be as old as his father)\nX = 2(F - S) (since his father will be twice as old as his sister was at that age)\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first, we get:\n\nJ + 2(F - S) = F\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nJ + 2F - 2S = F\nJ + F = 2S\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\nJ + 2S + F = 100\nJ + F = 2S\n\nWe can solve for J and F in terms of S by subtracting the second equation from the first:\n\nJ + 2S + F - (J + F) = 100 - 2S\nSolving for F, we get:\n\nF = 50 - S\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for F into the second equation to get:\n\nJ + (50 - S) = 2S\nJ = S - 50\n\nWe know that J, S, and F are all positive integers, so we can use this information to find possible values of S. Since J = S - 50, J must be less than S. Also, since J + S + F = 100, we know that S + F must be greater than 50. \n\nTrying out some values of S, we find that S = 52 works, which gives us J = 2 and F = 48. \n\nTherefore, the age of Joe's father is 48.

Therefore, at the end of the first day, the frog is 1m above the bottom of the well.

Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%",

We can use three sets: W for employees who take a winter vacation, S for employees who take a summer vacation, and N for employees who take neither. We know that 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, so the size of set W is 75%. We also know that 20% take neither vacation, so the size of set N is 20%. We can fill in these values on the Venn diagram: \n\n```\n     __________\n    /          \\\n   /            \\\n  /      W       \\\n /________________\\\n|        |         |\n|   S    |    NS   |\n|________|________|\n```\n\nNext, we know that 40% take both vacations. We don't know how many people take only a summer vacation, but we can call that number x. Then the size of set S is x + 40%, since that includes everyone who takes a summer vacation (whether or not they also take a winter vacation). We can fill in these values on the Venn diagram: \n\n```\n     __________\n    /          \\\n   /            \\\n  /      W       \\\n /________________\\\n|        |         |\n|   S    |    NS   |\n|  x+40% |  20%    |\n|________|________|\n```\n\nFinally, we want to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. This is the size of set S minus the size of the overlap between sets S and W. We can write this as: \n\n(S - (W \u2229 S)) / 100% \n\nWe know that W is 75% and that W \u2229 S is 40%, so we can substitute these values: \n\n(S - 40%) / 100% \n\nWe also know that the size of set N is 20%, so the size of set S must be: \n\nS + N = 100% - 20% = 80% \n\nWe can substitute this value for S: \n\n(80% - 40%) / 100% = 40% / 100% = 0.4 \n\nSo the answer is 40%, which is equivalent to 0.4 as a decimal.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's start by finding the amount of zinc and copper in 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y. \n\nFor alloy X: \n- The ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. \n- This means that for every 2 parts of zinc, there are 3 parts of copper. \n- We can set up a proportion to find the amount of zinc and copper in 40 grams of alloy X: \n\n2/5 = amount of zinc in 40 grams / amount of copper in 40 grams \n\nSimplifying this proportion, we get: \n\namount of zinc in 40 grams = (2/5) * amount of copper in 40 grams \n\nWe can use the fact that the ratio of zinc to copper is 2:3 to write: \n\namount of zinc in 40 grams = (2/5) * (3/5) * 40 = 24/5 grams \namount of copper in 40 grams = (3/5) * 40 = 24 grams \n\nSo, alloy X contains 24/5 grams of zinc and 24 grams of copper. \n\nFor alloy Y: \n- The ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which does not simplify. \n- This means that for every 7 parts of zinc, there are 11 parts of copper. \n- We can set up a proportion to find the amount of zinc and copper in 60 grams of alloy Y: \n\n7/18 = amount of zinc in 60 grams / amount of copper in 60 grams \n\nSimplifying this proportion, we get: \n\namount of zinc in 60 grams = (7/18) * amount of copper in 60 grams \n\nWe can use the fact that the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11 to write: \n\namount of zinc in 60 grams = (7/18) * (11/18) * 60 = 77/6 grams \namount of copper in 60 grams = (11/18) * 60 = 110/3 grams \n\nSo, alloy Y contains 77/6 grams of zinc and 110/3 grams of copper. \n\nNow, we can find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z: \n\ntotal amount of zinc = (24/5) + (77/6) = 287/30 grams \ntotal amount of copper = 24 + (110/3) = 362/3 grams \n\nFinally, we can write the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z: \n\nratio of zinc to copper = (287/30) : (362/3) \n\nSimplifying this ratio, we get: \n\nratio of zinc to copper = 191 : 241 \n\nTherefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 191:241.

This means that the remaining steps in the staircase (after walking 20 steps) is (S - 20) and the time taken to cover those steps is (10 - 1) = 9 minutes (since we already spent 1 minute walking 20 steps). \n\nSo, we can write the equation: (S - 20)/E = 9 \n\nFrom the second piece of information, we know that if we walk 10 steps and stop, we reach the ground in 20 minutes.

If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the volume of the coin made of alloy. The volume of a cylinder (which is the shape of the coin) is given by the formula: V = \u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Since the diameter of the coin is 15 mm, the radius is 7.5 mm. The height is given as 2 mm. Therefore, the volume of the coin is: V = \u03c0(7.5)^2(2) \u2248 353.43 mm^3 Next, we need to find the volume of aluminum in the coin. Since the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, we can divide the total volume by 2 to get the volume of each metal. Therefore, the volume of aluminum is approximately 176.72 mm^3. We know that the weight of the coin is 30 grams. Let's call the weight of the aluminum in the coin \"A\" and the weight of the silver in the coin \"S\". We can set up two equations based on the given information: A + S = 30 (total weight of the coin) A/\u03c1 + S/2\u03c1 = 176.72 (volume of aluminum and silver, where \u03c1 is the density of aluminum) Simplifying the second equation, we get: A + S/2 = 353.44/\u03c1 Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: 2A + S = 706.88/\u03c1 Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to eliminate S: 2A + (30 - A) = 706.88/\u03c1 Simplifying, we get: A = 706.88/\u03c1 - 30 Now we can find the weight of a pure aluminum coin measuring 1 x 30 mm. The volume of this coin is: V = \u03c0(15/2)^2(1) = 176.71 mm^3 (since the volume of aluminum in the alloy coin equals that of silver) The density of aluminum is given as 1/3 the density of silver (since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum). Therefore, \u03c1 = 3/2 = 1.5 g/cm^3. The weight of the pure aluminum coin is: A/\u03c1 = (706.88/1.5 - 30) \u2248 448.59 grams Therefore, the answer is not one of the answer choices provided.
