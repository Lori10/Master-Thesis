If 15 balls are green and the sum of red balls and green balls is less than 25, at most how many red balls are there? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 9\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Given that there are 40 balls in total and 15 of them are green, we can find the number of red balls by subtracting the number of green and blue balls from the total number of balls: Number of red balls = Total number of balls - Number of green balls - Number of blue balls We don't know the number of blue balls, but we do know that the sum of red and green balls is less than 25. So we can write: Number of red balls + Number of green balls < 25 Substituting the value of the number of green balls, we get: Number of red balls + 15 < 25 Simplifying, we get: Number of red balls < 10 So the maximum number of red balls is 9. Therefore, the answer is (E) 9. The answer is E.\n\nQ: 150 ml of 30% sulphuric acid was added to approximate 400 ml of 12% sulphuric acid solution. Find the approximate concentration Q of the acid in the mixture? Answer Choices: (A) 1/2 (B) 1/3 (C) 1/4 (D) 1/6 (E) 1/5\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Calculate the amount of sulphuric acid in the 150 ml of 30% solution. 30% of 150 ml = (30/100) x 150 ml = 45 ml Step 2: Calculate the amount of sulphuric acid in the 400 ml of 12% solution. 12% of 400 ml = (12/100) x 400 ml = 48 ml Step 3: Calculate the total amount of sulphuric acid in the mixture. 45 ml + 48 ml = 93 ml Step 4: Calculate the total volume of the mixture. 150 ml + 400 ml = 550 ml Step 5: Calculate the concentration of the sulphuric acid in the mixture. Q = (93/550) x 100% Q = 16.91% None of the answer choices match the calculated concentration, so the answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\nQ: Which of the following values is the greatest Answer Choices: (A) a)  30% of 89 (B) b)  22% of 78 (C) c)  33% of 67 (D) d)  44% of 56 (E) e)  55% of 45\n\nA: Let's think step by step. A) 30% of 89 = 0.3 x 89 = 26.7 B) 22% of 78 = 0.22 x 78 = 17.16 C) 33% of 67 = 0.33 x 67 = 22.11 D) 44% of 56 = 0.44 x 56 = 24.64 E) 55% of 45 = 0.55 x 45 = 24.75 Therefore, the greatest value is option (E) 55% of 45. The answer is E.\n\nQ: A jar full of whisky contains 40% alcohol. A part of this whisky is replaced by another containg 19% alcohol and now the percentage of alcohol was found to be 22%. What quantity of whisky is replaced ? Answer Choices: (A) 1/3 (B) 2/3 (C) 2/5 (D) 3/5 (E) 4/5\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the jar initially contains 100 units of whisky. Out of these 100 units, 40 units are alcohol. Let's say x units of whisky are replaced with the new whisky containing 19% alcohol. So, the amount of alcohol in the new mixture will be: 40 - 0.4x (alcohol in the original mixture) + 0.19x (alcohol in the new mixture) The total amount of whisky in the new mixture will be: 100 - x (original amount) + x (new amount) Now, we are given that the percentage of alcohol in the new mixture is 22%. So, we can set up the equation: (40 - 0.4x + 0.19x)/(100) = 0.22 Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 2/5 Therefore, 2/5 of the original amount of whisky is replaced with the new whisky containing 19% alcohol. So, the answer is (C) 2/5. The answer is C.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step."

One gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E, which is 9 units, and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, which is 10 units. Let's say we need to eat x grams of the health food to get the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins. So, the amount of vitamin E we get from x grams of the health food is 9x units, and the amount of vitamin A we get from x grams of the health food is 10x units. We need to get at least 100 units of vitamin E and 125 units of vitamin A. So, we can set up the equations: 9x >= 100 and 10x >= 125 Solving these equations, we get: x >= 100/9 and x >= 125/10 We need to take the larger value of x, which is x >= 125/10 = 12.5 Therefore, we need to eat at least 12.5 grams of the health food daily to get the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.

We know that R is not equal to 0, so A x E + B x D must be greater than or equal to 10. The only possible values for A and E are 1 and 2 (since A x E = I). If A = 1 and E = 2, then B x D = 8, which is not possible since B and D are distinct letters representing distinct digits. Therefore, A = 2 and E = 1.

Period of ball A = 26/2 = 13 minutes Period of ball B = 35/5 = 7 minutes We need to find the time at which both balls will be at the same starting point again. This will happen when both balls complete an integer number of rotations. Let's assume that both balls complete n rotations. The time taken by ball A to complete n rotations will be n times its period, which is 13n minutes. The time taken by ball B to complete n rotations will be n times its period, which is 7n minutes. We want to find the smallest value of n for which both times are equal. So, we can set up the equation: 13n = 7n + k, where k is the time taken for both balls to be at the same starting point again after completing n rotations. Solving for n, we get: n = k/6 We know that n has to be an integer. So, k has to be a multiple of 6. The smallest multiple of 6 that is greater than both 13 and 7 is 42. So, k = 42. Therefore, both balls will be at the same starting point again after 42 minutes. Converting this to hours and minutes, we get: 42 minutes = 0 hours and 42 minutes Adding this to the current time, we get: Current time + 0 hours and 42 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes Therefore, the answer is (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes.

There are 10 choices for the first speaker, 9 choices for the second speaker, and 8 choices for the third speaker. However, since the order of the pm, mp, and mla is fixed, we need to divide by 3! to account for the different ways they can be arranged. So, the number of ways to choose the positions for the pm, mp, and mla is:\n\n(10 x 9 x 8)/(3 x 2 x 1) = 120\n\nStep 2: Arrange the remaining 7 speakers. There are 7 choices for the fourth speaker, 6 choices for the fifth speaker, and so on, down to 1 choice for the tenth speaker.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the original amount of dog food in the bowl was 100 units. At 9:00 am, the dog would have eaten 1/3 of the remaining food, which would be 1/3 of 100 = 33.33 units. So, the amount of food remaining in the bowl at 9:00 am would be 100 - 33.33 = 66.67 units. Similarly, at 10:00 am, the dog would have eaten 1/3 of the remaining food, which would be 1/3 of 66.67 = 22.22 units. So, the amount of food remaining in the bowl at 10:00 am would be 66.67 - 22.22 = 44.45 units. Similarly, at 11:00 am, the dog would have eaten 1/3 of the remaining food, which would be 1/3 of 44.45 = 14.82 units.

We are given that the total amount spent is 810. So, we can set up the equation: 70x + 30y = 810 We want to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. This means that we want to find the maximum value of x such that the above equation is satisfied. We can simplify the equation as follows: 7x + 3y = 81 Dividing both sides by 3, we get: 7/3 x + y = 27 We want to maximize x, which means we want to minimize y. The minimum value of y occurs when 7/3 x is an integer. The largest integer value of 7/3 x that is less than or equal to 27 is 21. So, we can set 7/3 x = 21, which gives us x = 9.

Then, the number of students who took only physics is 0.2x - y, and the number of students who took only math is 0.28x - y. The total number of students who took physics or math (or both) is the sum of these three groups: 0.2x - y + 0.28x - y + y = 0.48x - y.

Therefore, we can write: 2(24 - b) + 2l = 48 Simplifying this equation, we get: l + b = 24 When folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm. So, the length of each part will be (66/2) - l = 33 - l.

We also know that the speed of Train M is greater than the speed of Train N. Let's assume that the speed of Train M is s1 and the speed of Train N is s2.

We know that 20 of the 500 deer caught in 2002 had tags from the previous year, so the percentage of tagged deer in the sample is: (20/500) x 100% = 4% We are also told that this percentage is representative of the percentage of tagged deer in the entire forest. Let's say that the total deer population in the forest is x. We know that 300 deer were tagged in 2001, so the percentage of tagged deer in the forest at the end of 2001 was: (300/x) x 100% During 2002, no new deer were tagged, so the percentage of tagged deer in the forest at the end of 2002 was the same as the percentage at the end of 2001 minus the percentage of tagged deer that were caught in the sample of 500 deer. We can set up the equation: (300/x) x 100% - 4% = (300/x - 20/500) x 100% Simplifying this equation, we get: (300/x) x 100% - 4% = (300/x - 2/5) x 100% Multiplying both sides by x, we get: 300 - 0.04x = 300 - 0.4x Solving for x, we get: x = 7500 Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 7500.

At the point of intersection, the sum of the distances covered by the two trains will be equal to the total distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow, which is the same for both trains. Let's say this distance is d km. So, we can set up the equation: 40t + 72(t-3) = d Simplifying this equation, we get: 112t - 216 = d Now, we know that the speed of the two trains combined is 40 + 72 = 112 kmph. So, we can use the formula: Speed = Distance/Time to find the time taken for the two trains to meet. Time taken = d/112 Substituting the value of d from the previous equation, we get: Time taken = (112t - 216)/112 Simplifying this equation, we get: Time taken = t - 9/14 So, the two trains will meet t - 9/14 hours after Train A's departure from Mumbai Central. Train A departs at 11 am, so t - 9/14 hours after that will be: 11 + t - 9/14 hours Since t is in hours, we need to convert 9/14 hours to minutes. 9/14 hours = (9/14) x 60 minutes = 38.57 minutes (approx) So, the two trains will meet at approximately 11:38 am + t hours.

Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can get a 4% discount if he pays within 30 days, or he can pay the full amount within n days and get no discount. Let's assume that the merchant borrows the money to pay for the motor boat and pays back the loan within 30 days to take advantage of the discount. The amount he needs to borrow is $20,000 - 4% of $20,000 = $19,200. To calculate the highest simple interest rate he can afford to borrow money, we need to find the amount of interest he will pay on a loan of $19,200 for 30 days. Let's assume the interest rate is r%. Then, the interest he will pay is: (r/100) x $19,200 x (30/365) We need to find the value of r that makes this interest amount less than or equal to the discount of $800 (4% of $20,000). So, we can set up the inequality: (r/100) x $19,200 x (30/365) \u2264 $800 Simplifying this inequality, we get: r \u2264 247.67 Therefore, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 247.67%.

For the first car: time = d / 12 For the second car: time = (50 - d) / 13 Since they both start at the same time, we can set these two equations equal to each other and solve for \"d\": d / 12 = (50 - d) / 13 Multiplying both sides by 12*13 = 156, we get: 13d = 600 - 12d Simplifying, we get: 25d = 600 d = 24 So the first car travels 24 miles and the second car travels 26 miles.

Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it sold 240 yellow golf balls and 240 white golf balls. We are also given that the store sold all of its white golf balls, so w = 0. This means that the store had y yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day. Therefore, y = 600 - w = 600 - 0 = 600.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that there are 100 students in Daifu university. Then, 24 students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. Let's say x students are members of the swim team. Then, 0.2x students are members of the swim team but not the chess club. We know that 24 students are members of both, so the total number of students who are members of the swim team is: x - 0.2x + 24 = 0.8x + 24 Now, we need to find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team. This is given by: (number of students who are members of the swim team)/(total number of students) x 100% = (0.8x + 24)/100 x 100% = 0.8x + 24% We don't know the value of x, but we do know that the answer must be one of the answer choices. Let's try each answer choice and see which one gives a value of x that makes sense. (A) If 20% of all students are members of the swim team, then x = 20. But this means that there are only 100 - 20 = 80 students who are not members of the swim team, and we know that 24 students are members of both. This is not possible, so (A) is not the answer. (B) If 30% of all students are members of the swim team, then x = 30. But this means that there are only 100 - 30 = 70 students who are not members of the swim team, and we know that 24 students are members of both. This is not possible, so (B) is not the answer. (C) If 40% of all students are members of the swim team, then x = 40. This means that there are 60 students who are not members of the swim team, and we know that 24 students are members of both. This is possible, so (C) could be the answer. (D) If 50% of all students are members of the swim team, then x = 50. But this means that there are only 100 - 50 = 50 students who are not members of the swim team, and we know that 24 students are members of both. This is not possible, so (D) is not the answer. (E) If 60% of all students are members of the swim team, then x = 60. But this means that there are only 100 - 60 = 40 students who are not members of the swim team, and we know that 24 students are members of both. This is not possible, so (E) is not the answer.

Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 24 (E) 26",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The total amount of money they have is $16,000 + $4,000 = $20,000. This amount allows them to influence 30 senators. Let's assume that Hoopsmot can influence x senators with his $16,000 contribution. Then, Smolapon can influence (30 - x) senators with his $4,000 contribution. The total amount of money they have is divided among the senators they can influence, so we can set up the equation: 16000x + 4000(30 - x) = 20000 Simplifying this equation, we get: 12000x = 8000 x = 2/3 * 30 = 20 Therefore, Hoopsmot can influence 20 senators, and Smolapon can influence 30 - 20 = 10 senators.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The first train that comes can be either from the main line or the harbor line. The main line train starts at 5 o'clock and has a frequency of 10 minutes. So, the first main line train will arrive at the station at 5 o'clock, the second at 5.10, the third at 5.20, and so on. The harbor line train starts at 5.02 and has a frequency of 10 minutes. So, the first harbor line train will arrive at the station at 5.02, the second at 5.12, the third at 5.22, and so on. To calculate the probability of the man catching the first train, we need to find out the time at which the first train arrives. The first train can arrive at any time between 5 o'clock and 5.20. So, the total time period during which the first train can arrive is 20 minutes. Out of these 20 minutes, the main line train covers the first 2 minutes (from 5 o'clock to 5.02) and the remaining 18 minutes are covered by both the main line and the harbor line trains. Since both the trains have the same frequency, they will cover the remaining 18 minutes equally. So, the probability of the man catching the first train is: Probability = (time covered by the first train)/(total time period) Probability = 2/20 = 1/10 Therefore, the answer is (A) 0.9.

So, we can set up the equation:\n\nx^2 - y^2 = 256000\n\nWe also know that the sum of the numbers is 1000. So, we can set up another equation:\n\nx + y = 1000\n\nWe can use the identity (x + y)(x - y) = x^2 - y^2 to solve for x and y. Substituting the value of x^2 - y^2 from the first equation, we get:\n\n(x + y)(x - y) = 256000\n\nSubstituting the value of x + y from the second equation, we get:\n\n(1000 - y)(x - y) = 256000\n\nExpanding this equation, we get:\n\nxy - y^2 - 1000x + 1000y = -256000\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\nxy - 1000x = -256000 - 1000y + y^2\n\nWe can use the second equation to substitute for x in terms of y:\n\nx = 1000 - y\n\nSubstituting this in the above equation, we get:\n\ny(1000 - y) - 1000(1000 - y) = -256000 - 1000y + y^2\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\ny^2 - 628y + 256000 = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we get:\n\ny = 372 or y = 256\n\nIf y = 372, then x = 628.

So, 100a + 10b + c > 100c + 10b + a Simplifying this inequality, we get: 99a + c > 100c Rearranging the terms, we get: 99a > 99c So, a > c Now, let's substitute the values of M and N in the equation M - N + 396c = 990. We get: (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990 Simplifying this equation, we get: 99a - 99c + 397c = 990 99a + 298c = 990 Dividing both sides by 99, we get: a + 3c = 10 Now, we need to find the values of a, b, and c such that a + 3c = 10 and M = 100a + 10b + c > 300. Since a > c, the possible values of (a, c) are (4, 2), (5, 1), and (6, 0). For each of these values, we can find the possible values of b such that M > 300. For example, if (a, c) = (4, 2), then we need to find the values of b such that 100a + 10b + c > 300.

This means that the perimeter of the yard will be: P = 2L + W - 10 We need to find the amount of fencing required, which is equal to the perimeter of the yard. So, we can substitute the value of P in terms of L and W: P = 2L + W - 10 = 2L + (240/L) - 10 Now, we need to find the value of L that minimizes the amount of fencing required. To do this, we can take the derivative of P with respect to L and set it equal to zero: dP/dL = 2 - 240/L^2 = 0 Solving for L, we get: L = sqrt(240) = 15.49 (approx) Now, we can substitute this value of L in the expression for P to get: P = 2L + (240/L) - 10 = 2(15.49) + (240/15.49) - 10 = 49.98 (approx) Therefore, Alice needs approximately 50 meters of fencing.

If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 28 (C) 30 (D) 53 (E) 59",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's first find out how many times the number of water lilies will double to cover the lake. If there is one water lily initially and it doubles every two days, then after 2 days there will be 2 lilies, after 4 days there will be 4 lilies, after 6 days there will be 8 lilies, and so on. In general, after n days, the number of lilies will be 2^(n/2). We want to find out after how many days the number of lilies will reach 64. So, we can set up the equation: 2^(n/2) = 64 Simplifying this equation, we get: n/2 = 6 n = 12 Therefore, it will take 12 days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies if there were initially 64 water lilies. However, we need to add the initial day when there were already 64 lilies. So, the total number of days will be 13. Therefore, the answer is None of the above.",

The area of four quadrants is 4(25/\u03c0) = 100/\u03c0. When the two semicircles are cut out, the remaining paper is in the shape of a rectangle with two semicircles removed from opposite sides. The length of the rectangle is equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm. The width of the rectangle is equal to the diameter of one of the semicircles, which is 10 cm.

The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes. So, the losing candidate got 100% - 15% = 85% of the votes. Let's assume that the winning candidate got x votes. Then, the losing candidate got 0.85x votes. The total number of votes cast is x + 0.85x = 1.85x votes. Therefore, the number of votes required to win is (1.85x/2) + 1 votes (rounded up to the nearest integer). Step 3: Calculate the total number of votes the winning candidate got.

Now, let's look at the second term: (2\u221an(n + 4) + 12)/ (n - 4\u221an + 4 + 8\u221an) We can simplify this by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2\u221an: (n + 2\u221an + 6/\u221an)/ (1 - 2/\u221an + 4/\u221an) We can simplify this further: (n\u221an + 2n + 6\u221an)/ (n\u221an + 2\u221an - 4) Now, let's look at the range of n again: 36 \u2264 n \u2264 72 We can see that n is greater than or equal to 36, which means that n\u221an is greater than or equal to 6\u221a36, which is 72. Therefore, we can say: (n\u221an + 2n + 6\u221an)/ (n\u221an + 2\u221an - 4) is between (72 + 72 + 6\u221a72)/ (72 + 6 - 4) and (72 + 144 + 6\u221a72)/ (72 + 12 - 4) which simplifies to: 23 + 3\u221a2 and 29 + 3\u221a2. Therefore, the range of x is between 1 + 23 + 3\u221a2 and 2.5 + 29 + 3\u221a2, which simplifies to: 24 + 3\u221a2 and 31.5 + 3\u221a2. Therefore, the answer is (B) 23 < x < 58. The answer is B.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Given that the perimeter of the rectangular plot is 340 meters. Let's assume that the length and breadth of the rectangular plot are l and b respectively. So, we have: 2(l + b) = 340 => l + b = 170 We need to find the cost of gardening a 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot. The length and breadth of the new rectangular plot will be (l + 2) and (b + 2) respectively. So, the area of the boundary will be: Area of the boundary = (l + 2)(b + 2) - lb We know that lb is the area of the rectangular plot. We can find lb using the equation l + b = 170. Let's say l = 85 - b. Substituting this in lb, we get: lb = b(85 - b) = 85b - b^2 So, the area of the boundary will be: Area of the boundary = (l + 2)(b + 2) - lb = (l + b + 4) - (85b - b^2) = 174 - 83b + b^2 Now, we can find the cost of gardening the boundary by multiplying the area of the boundary by the rate of 10 per square meter. Cost of gardening the boundary = 10(174 - 83b + b^2) = 1740 - 830b + 10b^2 We cannot determine the value of b or the cost of gardening the boundary without additional information.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can start by finding the speed of the space shuttle. The shuttle travels 700m in 40 seconds, so its speed is: 700/40 = 17.5 m/s\n\nNext, we can find the distance the shuttle travels during the 5 seconds it takes to pass a point. Since speed = distance/time, we can rearrange this to get distance = speed x time. So, the distance traveled during the 5 seconds is: 17.5 x 5 = 87.5 m\n\nFinally, we can find the length of the shuttle by subtracting the distance traveled during the 5 seconds from the total distance traveled during the 40 seconds. The total distance traveled is 700m, so the length of the shuttle is: 700 - 87.5 = 612.5 m\n\nTherefore, the length of the space shuttle is approximately 612.5 meters.

Answer Choices: (A) After 6 minutes (B) After 12 minutes (C) After 18 minutes (D) After 24 minutes (E) none",
            "Pred_Rationale": "We need to find the time at which all three bells will ring together again. This is the time at which their cycles will align. Let's call this time T. We know that the first bell rings every 36 seconds, so it will ring T/36 times in the time T. Similarly, the second bell will ring T/40 times and the third bell will ring T/48 times. For all three bells to ring together again, the number of times they ring must be a whole number. So, we need to find the smallest value of T for which T/36, T/40, and T/48 are all whole numbers. The smallest such value of T is the least common multiple (LCM) of 36, 40, and 48. Prime factorizing these numbers, we get: 36 = 2^2 x 3^2 40 = 2^3 x 5 48 = 2^4 x 3 To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers: LCM = 2^4 x 3^2 x 5 = 720 Therefore, all three bells will ring together again after 720 seconds, which is 12 minutes.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's first find the amount of zinc and copper in 40 grams of alloy X. \n\nThe ratio of zinc to copper in alloy X is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. \n\nSo, out of every 2+3=5 parts of the alloy, 2 parts are zinc and 3 parts are copper. \n\nTherefore, the amount of zinc in 40 grams of alloy X is (2/5) x 40 = 16 grams. \n\nSimilarly, the amount of copper in 40 grams of alloy X is (3/5) x 40 = 24 grams. \n\nNow, let's find the amount of zinc and copper in 60 grams of alloy Y. \n\nThe ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Y is 7:11, which does not simplify. \n\nSo, out of every 7+11=18 parts of the alloy, 7 parts are zinc and 11 parts are copper. \n\nTherefore, the amount of zinc in 60 grams of alloy Y is (7/18) x 60 = 23.33 grams (approx). \n\nSimilarly, the amount of copper in 60 grams of alloy Y is (11/18) x 60 = 36.67 grams (approx). \n\nNow, let's find the total amount of zinc and copper in the alloy Z. \n\nThe total amount of zinc in alloy Z is 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams (approx). \n\nThe total amount of copper in alloy Z is 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams (approx). \n\nTherefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is approximately 39.33:60.67, which simplifies to 59:91. \n\nSo, the answer is (D) 59:91.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the wholesale cost of the appliance is $100. Then, the original retail price would be $100 + 60% of $100 = $160. However, the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, which means it was sold for 80% of the original retail price. So, the selling price of the appliance is 80% of $160 = $128. \n\nNow, we need to find out what percent more than the wholesale cost the selling price is. The selling price is $128, which is $28 more than the wholesale cost of $100. So, the percent more than the wholesale cost is:\n\n($28/$100) x 100% = 28%\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 28%.",

So, we can write:\n\n(S-20)/E = 10\n\nS-20 = 10E\n\nS = 10E + 20\n\nSimilarly, if you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach the ground in 20 minutes.

We know that the weight of the coin is 30 grams. So, we can set up the equation: x + y = 30 Step 3: We are given that the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver. So, we can set up another equation: (x/\u03c1a) = (y/\u03c1s) where \u03c1a is the density of aluminum and \u03c1s is the density of silver. We are also given that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum.
