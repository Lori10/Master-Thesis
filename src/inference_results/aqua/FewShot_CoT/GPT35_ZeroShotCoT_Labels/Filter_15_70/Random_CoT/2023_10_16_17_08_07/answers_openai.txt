If 15 balls are green and the sum of red balls and green balls is less than 25, at most how many red balls are there? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 9\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Given that there are 40 balls in total and 15 of them are green, we can find the number of red balls by subtracting the number of green and blue balls from the total number of balls: Number of red balls = Total number of balls - Number of green balls - Number of blue balls We don't know the number of blue balls, but we do know that the sum of red and green balls is less than 25. So we can write: Number of red balls + Number of green balls < 25 Substituting the value of the number of green balls, we get: Number of red balls + 15 < 25 Simplifying, we get: Number of red balls < 10 So the maximum number of red balls is 9. Therefore, the answer is (E) 9. The answer is E.\n\nQ: 150 ml of 30% sulphuric acid was added to approximate 400 ml of 12% sulphuric acid solution. Find the approximate concentration Q of the acid in the mixture? Answer Choices: (A) 1/2 (B) 1/3 (C) 1/4 (D) 1/6 (E) 1/5\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Calculate the amount of sulphuric acid in the 150 ml of 30% solution. 30% of 150 ml = (30/100) x 150 ml = 45 ml Step 2: Calculate the amount of sulphuric acid in the 400 ml of 12% solution. 12% of 400 ml = (12/100) x 400 ml = 48 ml Step 3: Calculate the total amount of sulphuric acid in the mixture. 45 ml + 48 ml = 93 ml Step 4: Calculate the total volume of the mixture. 150 ml + 400 ml = 550 ml Step 5: Calculate the concentration of the sulphuric acid in the mixture. Q = (93/550) x 100% Q = 16.91% None of the answer choices match the calculated concentration, so the answer is None of the above. The answer is C.\n\nQ: Which of the following values is the greatest Answer Choices: (A) a)  30% of 89 (B) b)  22% of 78 (C) c)  33% of 67 (D) d)  44% of 56 (E) e)  55% of 45\n\nA: Let's think step by step. A) 30% of 89 = 0.3 x 89 = 26.7 B) 22% of 78 = 0.22 x 78 = 17.16 C) 33% of 67 = 0.33 x 67 = 22.11 D) 44% of 56 = 0.44 x 56 = 24.64 E) 55% of 45 = 0.55 x 45 = 24.75 Therefore, the greatest value is option (E) 55% of 45. The answer is E.\n\nQ: A jar full of whisky contains 40% alcohol. A part of this whisky is replaced by another containg 19% alcohol and now the percentage of alcohol was found to be 22%. What quantity of whisky is replaced ? Answer Choices: (A) 1/3 (B) 2/3 (C) 2/5 (D) 3/5 (E) 4/5\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the jar initially contains 100 units of whisky. Out of these 100 units, 40 units are alcohol. Let's say x units of whisky are replaced with the new whisky containing 19% alcohol. So, the amount of alcohol in the new mixture will be: 40 - 0.4x (alcohol in the original mixture) + 0.19x (alcohol in the new mixture) The total amount of whisky in the new mixture will be: 100 - x (original amount) + x (new amount) Now, we are given that the percentage of alcohol in the new mixture is 22%. So, we can set up the equation: (40 - 0.4x + 0.19x)/(100) = 0.22 Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 2/5 Therefore, 2/5 of the original amount of whisky is replaced with the new whisky containing 19% alcohol. So, the answer is (C) 2/5. The answer is C.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",

First, we need to find 60% of 900, which is 0.6 x 900 = 540. Next, we can set up the equation: 45 x ? = 540 To solve for ?, we can divide both sides by 45: ? = 540/45 ? = 12 Therefore, the answer is (B) 12. The answer is B.\n\nQ: What Should come in place of the question mark in the following number series ?\nQ. 5 8 10 12 16 (?) Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 18 (C) 17 (D) 21 (E) 23\n\nA: Let's think step by step. The difference between 5 and 8 is 3, between 8 and 10 is 2, between 10 and 12 is 2, and between 12 and 16 is 4. So, it seems like the differences are not following a specific pattern. To find the missing number, we can try to look for other patterns. One possible pattern is that the numbers are increasing by 1, then 2, then 2, then 4, and so on. Following this pattern, the next number should increase by 4, making it 16 + 4 = 20. However, this number is not among the answer choices. The closest answer choice is (D) 21, which is an increase of 5 from the previous number. This pattern is also possible, as it would be an increase of 1, then 2, then 2, then 5. Therefore, the answer is (D) 21. The answer is D.\n\nQ: If a certain sample of data has a mean of 21.0 and a standard deviation of 3.0, which of the following values is more than 2.5 standard deviations from the mean? Answer Choices: (A) 12.0 (B) 13.5 (C) 17.0 (D) 23.5 (E) 26.5\n\nA: Let's think step by step. The formula for calculating the number of standard deviations a value is from the mean is: z = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3 where z is the number of standard deviations, x is the value, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation. We want to find the value that is more than 2.5 standard deviations from the mean. So we need to find the value of z that corresponds to 2.5 standard deviations. We can use the z-score table or a calculator to find that the z-score for 2.5 standard deviations is approximately 0.9938. Now we can use the formula to solve for x: 0.9938 = (x - 21) / 3 Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: 2.9814 = x - 21 Adding 21 to both sides, we get: x = 23.9814 So the value that is more than 2.5 standard deviations from the mean is approximately 23.98. The closest answer choice is (D) 23.5, which is less than 2.5 standard deviations from the mean. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\nQ: The present ages of three persons are in proportions 4:7:9. Seven years ago, the sum of their ages was 79. Find their present ages. Answer Choices: (A) 20, 28 (B) 28, 36 (C) 35, 45 (D) 35, 55 (E) of these\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the present ages of the three persons be 4x, 7x, and 9x, respectively. Seven years ago, their ages were (4x-7), (7x-7), and (9x-7), respectively. According to the problem, the sum of their ages seven years ago was 79: (4x-7) + (7x-7) + (9x-7) = 79 Simplifying the equation: 20x - 21 = 79 20x = 100 x = 5 Therefore, their present ages are: 4x = 20 7x = 35 9x = 45 So the answer is (C) 35, 45. The answer is C.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
