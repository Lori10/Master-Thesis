First, we need to find 60% of 900, which is 0.6 x 900 = 540. Next, we can set up the equation: 45 x ? = 540 To solve for ?, we can divide both sides by 45: ? = 540/45 ? = 12 Therefore, the answer is (B) 12. The answer is B.\n\nQ: What Should come in place of the question mark in the following number series ?\nQ. 5 8 10 12 16 (?) Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 18 (C) 17 (D) 21 (E) 23\n\nA: Let's think step by step. The difference between 5 and 8 is 3, between 8 and 10 is 2, between 10 and 12 is 2, and between 12 and 16 is 4. So, it seems like the differences are not following a specific pattern. To find the missing number, we can try to look for other patterns. One possible pattern is that the numbers are increasing by 1, then 2, then 2, then 4, and so on. Following this pattern, the next number should increase by 4, making it 16 + 4 = 20. However, this number is not among the answer choices. The closest answer choice is (D) 21, which is an increase of 5 from the previous number. This pattern is also possible, as it would be an increase of 1, then 2, then 2, then 5. Therefore, the answer is (D) 21. The answer is D.\n\nQ: If a certain sample of data has a mean of 21.0 and a standard deviation of 3.0, which of the following values is more than 2.5 standard deviations from the mean? Answer Choices: (A) 12.0 (B) 13.5 (C) 17.0 (D) 23.5 (E) 26.5\n\nA: Let's think step by step. The formula for calculating the number of standard deviations a value is from the mean is: z = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3 where z is the number of standard deviations, x is the value, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation. We want to find the value that is more than 2.5 standard deviations from the mean. So we need to find the value of z that corresponds to 2.5 standard deviations. We can use the z-score table or a calculator to find that the z-score for 2.5 standard deviations is approximately 0.9938. Now we can use the formula to solve for x: 0.9938 = (x - 21) / 3 Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: 2.9814 = x - 21 Adding 21 to both sides, we get: x = 23.9814 So the value that is more than 2.5 standard deviations from the mean is approximately 23.98. The closest answer choice is (D) 23.5, which is less than 2.5 standard deviations from the mean. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above. The answer is D.\n\nQ: The present ages of three persons are in proportions 4:7:9. Seven years ago, the sum of their ages was 79. Find their present ages. Answer Choices: (A) 20, 28 (B) 28, 36 (C) 35, 45 (D) 35, 55 (E) of these\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the present ages of the three persons be 4x, 7x, and 9x, respectively. Seven years ago, their ages were (4x-7), (7x-7), and (9x-7), respectively. According to the problem, the sum of their ages seven years ago was 79: (4x-7) + (7x-7) + (9x-7) = 79 Simplifying the equation: 20x - 21 = 79 20x = 100 x = 5 Therefore, their present ages are: 4x = 20 7x = 35 9x = 45 So the answer is (C) 35, 45. The answer is C.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step."

            "Pred_Rationale": "The company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each, so the total revenue from the sale of pens is 7200 x 10 = Rs. 72,000.\n\nThe company estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%, which means that the total profit is 25% of the total cost. Let the total cost of manufacturing all the pens be C.\n\nThe company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective and are rejected before packing. This means that the company only sells 90% of the manufactured pens. So, the number of pens that the company manufactures is:\n\n90% of total pens = 7200\n(90/100) x total pens = 7200\ntotal pens = (7200 x 100) / 90\ntotal pens = 8000\n\nNow, we can calculate the cost of manufacturing each pen:\n\nTotal cost = C\nTotal revenue = Rs. 72,000\nTotal profit = 25% of C = 0.25C\n\nTotal revenue = Total cost + Total profit\nRs. 72,000 = C + 0.25C\nRs. 72,000 = 1.25C\nC = Rs. 57,600\n\nThe cost of manufacturing each pen is the total cost divided by the number of pens manufactured:\n\nCost per pen = C / total pens\nCost per pen = Rs. 57,600 / 8000\nCost per pen = Rs. 7.2\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Rs. 7.2.",

Mr. Brown can do 1/6 of the job in one day, Mr. Black can do 1/8 of the job in one day, and Mr. Blue can do 1/12 of the job in one day. \n\nAfter 8 days, Mr. Brown has completed 8/6 = 4/3 of the job. The remaining fraction of the job is 1 - 4/3 = -1/3. This means that the job is behind schedule.\n\nNext, Mr. Black works for 6 days. In those 6 days, he can complete 6/8 = 3/4 of the job. Together with what Mr. Brown has done, the total fraction of the job completed is 4/3 + 3/4 = 13/12. \n\nThis means that there is still 1 - 13/12 = -1/12 of the job remaining. Again, the job is behind schedule.\n\nFinally, we can use the formula: \n\ntime = work / rate \n\nwhere work is the remaining fraction of the job, and rate is the combined rate of Mr. Black and Mr. Blue. \n\nThe combined rate of Mr. Black and Mr. Blue is: \n\n1/8 + 1/12 = 5/24 \n\nSo the time it will take Mr. Blue to complete the remaining fraction of the job is: \n\ntime = (-1/12) / (5/24) = 2.4 \n\nTherefore, it will take Mr. Blue 2.4 days to complete the remaining fraction of the job.

Answer Choices: (A) 43 seconds (B) 39 seconds (C) 20 seconds (D) 33 seconds (E) 55 seconds",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, which is 1 mile long. This means that the front of the train has covered 1 mile in 3 seconds. Therefore, the speed of the train is: \n\nSpeed = Distance / Time = 1 mile / 3 seconds \n\nWe can convert the speed to miles per hour by multiplying by 3600 seconds per hour: \n\nSpeed = (1 mile / 3 seconds) x (3600 seconds / 1 hour) = 1200 miles per hour \n\nThis is the speed of the front of the train. However, the back of the train is still outside the tunnel when the front enters. So we need to find the time it takes for the back of the train to enter the tunnel as well. \n\nThe length of the train is not given, but we can use the fact that the train is traveling at a constant speed to find it. If the train is 1 mile long, and it takes 3 seconds to cover the first mile, then it will take another 3 seconds to cover the second mile (since it is traveling at a constant speed). Therefore, the length of the train is 2 miles. \n\nNow we can find the time it takes for the back of the train to enter the tunnel: \n\nTime = Distance / Speed = 2 miles / 120 miles per hour \n\nWe can convert the time to seconds by multiplying by 3600 seconds per hour: \n\nTime = (2 miles / 120 miles per hour) x (3600 seconds / 1 hour) = 60 seconds / 2 = 30 seconds \n\nTherefore, the total time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel is: \n\nTotal time = 3 seconds (for the front to enter) + 30 seconds (for the back to enter) = 33 seconds \n\nSo the answer is (D) 33 seconds.",

At 9:00 am, the dog has eaten for 1 hour, so there is 2/3 of the original amount left, which is 2/3 x 100 = 66.67 units. At 10:00 am, the dog has eaten for 2 hours, so there is 2/3 of the remaining amount left, which is 2/3 x 66.67 = 44.44 units. At 11:00 am, the dog has eaten for 3 hours, so there is 2/3 of the remaining amount left, which is 2/3 x 44.44 = 29.63 units. Finally, at 12:00 pm, the dog has eaten for 4 hours, so there is 2/3 of the remaining amount left, which is 2/3 x 29.63 = 19.75 units.

According to the problem, 20% of the students took physics and 28% of the students took math. We don't know if there is any overlap between these two groups, so we can't simply add 20% and 28% to get the total number of students who took either physics or math. Instead, we need to find the minimum number of students who took both physics and math, and subtract that from the total number of students who took either physics or math. Let's call the number of students who took both physics and math y. Then we can set up the following equations:\n\ny <= 20% of x (since the number of students who took both physics and math can't be greater than the number of students who took physics)\ny <= 28% of x (since the number of students who took both physics and math can't be greater than the number of students who took math)\ny >= 0 (since the number of students who took both physics and math can't be negative)\n\nTo find the minimum possible value of y, we can take the smaller of the two values on the right-hand side of the first two equations.

Simplifying this expression, we get:\n\ny <= 20% of x (since 20% is smaller than 28%)\n\nTo find the total number of students who took either physics or math, we can add the number of students who took physics (20% of x) to the number of students who took math (28% of x), and then subtract the number of students who took both physics and math (y).

This means that the length of each part is (48/2) - b = 24 - b, and the breadth of each part is l. Therefore, the area of each part is A1 = l(24 - b). When folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm. This means that the length of each part is (66/2) - l = 33 - l, and the breadth of each part is b. Therefore, the area of each part is A2 = b(33 - l). Since the two parts are equal in area, we can equate A1 and A2: l(24 - b) = b(33 - l) Expanding the terms: 24l - lb = 33b - bl Simplifying the equation: 25b = 24l + 33b 8b = 24l b = 3l Substituting b = 3l in the equation 25b = 24l + 33b, we get: 25(3l) = 24l + 33(3l) 75l = 123l l = 6 cm Therefore, b = 3l = 18 cm The area of the rectangular sheet is A = lb = 6 x 18 = 108 cm^2.

Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's first find the total number of children in the row. We can do this by adding the position of Neha from the left end and the position of Radha from the right end and subtracting 1 (since they are both counting themselves in their respective positions): \n\nTotal number of children = 12 + 6 - 1 = 17 \n\nNow, we know that when Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places, she becomes the 4th child from the right end (since there were 6 children to her right before). Similarly, when Neha is shifted to the right by 2 places, she becomes the 14th child from the left end (since there were 12 children to her left before). \n\nWe also know that there are 6 children between Radha and Neha after they have been shifted. Therefore, the distance between the 4th child from the right end and the 14th child from the left end is 6 + 1 (counting the child at the 4th position) + 1 (counting the child at the 14th position) = 8. \n\nSo, the total number of children in the row is: \n\n17 + 8 = 25 \n\nHowever, this is not one of the answer choices. The closest answer choice is (B) 27, which is 2 more than our answer. This makes sense, since we shifted Radha and Neha by 2 places each, which would add 4 children to the row.

To find the total weight of the mixture, we can set up a proportion: 2 parts / 3 pounds = 10 parts / x pounds Solving for x, we get: x = (3 pounds x 10) / 2 parts x = 15 pounds Now we know that the bag contains 15 pounds of the mixture, and 5 parts of that mixture are corn. To find the weight of the corn, we can set up another proportion: 5 parts / 15 pounds = x parts / y pounds Solving for y, we get: y = (15 pounds x x) / 5 parts y = 3x Now we just need to substitute x = 3 pounds (the weight of the rice) into the equation to find the weight of the corn: y = 3x y = 3 x 3 y = 9 pounds Therefore, the bag contains 9 pounds of corn.

So, by the time Train B starts at 2 pm, Train A has already covered a distance of 3 hours x 40 kmph = 120 km. Let's assume that the two trains meet after t hours of Train B's journey. At that time, Train A has traveled for (t + 3) hours. The distance covered by Train A is 40 x (t + 3) km. The distance covered by Train B is 72 x t km. Since they are traveling towards each other, the total distance covered by both trains is the distance between them. This distance is (120 + 40t + 72t) km. We can now set up an equation: 120 + 40t + 72t = (120 + 40(t + 3)) km Simplifying the equation: 120 + 40t + 72t = 120 + 40t + 120 km 72t = 120 km t = 1.67 hours or 1 hour and 40 minutes. Therefore, the two trains will meet after 1 hour and 40 minutes of Train B's journey, which is at 3:40 pm. So the answer is (C) 5 pm on the next day. The answer is C.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can start by using the formula: distance = rate x time. Let d be the distance that ant A travels until meeting ant B, and let t be the time it takes for them to meet. Since they are moving towards each other, their combined speed is 9 + 6 = 15 cm per hour. Therefore, we can write: d = 15t. We also know that the total distance between the farms is 75 cm. When they meet, they will have traveled a total distance of 75 cm. Therefore, we can write: d + d = 75 Simplifying the equation: 2d = 75 d = 37.5 Therefore, the distance that ant A travels until meeting ant B is half of the total distance, which is 37.5 cm.

(Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.) Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20",
            "Pred_Rationale": "If Amy uses a single letter to represent each type of book, she would need at least 10 letters. However, if she uses pairs of two different letters, she can create more unique combinations with fewer letters. The number of unique combinations of pairs of letters is given by the formula n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of distinct letters. For example, if Amy uses the letters A, B, and C, she can create the following pairs: AB, AC, and BC, which is a total of 3(3-1)/2 = 3 combinations. To find the smallest number of letters Amy needs to create the codes for all 10 types of books, we need to find the smallest value of n such that n(n-1)/2 >= 10. We can try different values of n: For n = 3, we have 3(3-1)/2 = 3 combinations. For n = 4, we have 4(4-1)/2 = 6 combinations. For n = 5, we have 5(5-1)/2 = 10 combinations.

Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can get a 4% discount if he pays within 30 days, or he can pay the full amount within n days and get no discount. To take advantage of the discount, the merchant needs to pay within 30 days, which means he needs to pay $20,000 - 4% of $20,000 = $19,200. If the merchant borrows money to pay for the boat, he needs to pay back $19,200 within 30 days. Let's assume he borrows the money at an annual simple interest rate of r%. Then the amount he needs to pay back after 30 days is: $19,200 + $19,200 x r x 30/365 Simplifying the equation: $19,200 x (1 + r x 30/365) <= $20,000 Dividing both sides by $19,200: 1 + r x 30/365 <= 20,000/19,200 1 + r x 30/365 <= 1.0417 r x 30/365 <= 0.0417 r <= 0.0417 x 365/30 r <= 0.5025 or 50.25% Therefore, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 50.25%.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can start by analyzing the properties of the greatest integer function [x]. This function rounds down any real number x to the nearest integer. For example, [3.7] = 3, [-2.3] = -3, [5] = 5, and so on.\n\nNext, let's consider the function L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y]. This function adds up the greatest integer values of x, y, and x + y. Similarly, the function R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] adds up the greatest integer values of 2x and 2y.\n\nTo determine whether it is possible to find positive real numbers x and y such that L(x,y) = R(x,y), we can try to find a general expression for each function. Let's start with L(x,y):\n\nL(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y]\n       = x - {x} + y - {y} + (x + y) - {x + y}\n       = 2x + 2y - {x} - {y} - {x + y}\n\nwhere {x} denotes the fractional part of x. Similarly, we can find an expression for R(x,y):\n\nR(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]\n       = 2x - {2x} + 2y - {2y}\n       = 2x + 2y - {x} - {y}\n\nComparing the two expressions, we see that L(x,y) has an additional term of {-x - y}, which is always between -1 and 0. Therefore, we can conclude that L(x,y) is always less than R(x,y) for any positive real numbers x and y. The correct answer is (C) L(x,y) < R(x,y).",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the three-digit number be represented by ABC, where A, B, and C are the digits. We know that A + B + C = 17 and A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109. We also know that when we subtract 495 from the number, we get a number with the same digits in reverse order. This means that ABC - 495 = CBA. \n\nWe can rewrite this equation as 100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100C + 10B + A. Simplifying this equation, we get 99A - 99C = 495, or A - C = 5. \n\nWe can use this equation along with the fact that A + B + C = 17 to solve for the digits. We can start by trying different values of A and C that differ by 5 and add up to 17. The only possible values are A = 9 and C = 4. This means that B = 4. \n\nWe can check that these values satisfy the equation A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109, which they do. Therefore, the three-digit number is 944, and when we subtract 495 from it, we get 449, which has the same digits in reverse order. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) 112.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to calculate how many quarter-miles we can travel for $5 (which is $8.50 - $3.50 for the first quarter-mile). We can set up an equation: 0.10x + 3.50 = 8.50 - 3.50 x = 50 This means we can travel 50 quarter-miles with $8.50. To convert this to miles, we divide by 4: 50 / 4 = 12.5 miles However, we need to subtract the first quarter-mile that costs $3.50: 12.5 - 0.25 = 12.25 miles Therefore, the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50 is 12.25 miles.

Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's call the distance between A and B \"d\". We know that Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, so the time it took him to travel from A to B is d/70. We also know that he turned right around and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph, so the time it took him to travel from B to A is also d/90. \n\nWe are told that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. This means that he had already traveled a distance of d-70 when he was 3 hours away from the end of his trip. \n\nWe can set up an equation using the information we have: \n\nd-70 = (d/70)(t-3) + (d/90)(t-3) \n\nwhere t is the total time of his trip. \n\nSimplifying the equation: \n\nd-70 = (d/70 + d/90)(t-3) \n\nMultiplying both sides by 630 (the least common multiple of 70 and 90): \n\n630d - 44100 = 9d(t-3) \n\n630d - 44100 = 9dt - 27d \n\n630d + 27d = 9dt + 44100 \n\n657d = 9dt + 44100 \n\nWe know that his average speed for the entire trip is d/(t-3), so we can set up another equation: \n\nd/(t-3) = (2d)/(d/70 + d/90) \n\nSimplifying the equation: \n\nd/(t-3) = 630 \n\nd = 630(t-3) \n\nSubstituting this expression for d into the previous equation: \n\n657(630(t-3)) = 9dt + 44100 \n\nSimplifying the equation: \n\n394830t - 2361960 = 9dt + 44100 \n\n394830t - 9dt = 2406060 \n\nt(394830 - 9d) = 2406060 \n\nt = 2406060/(394830 - 9d) \n\nWe know that Kevin was still 70 miles away from B when he was 3 hours away from the end of his trip, so we can set up another equation: \n\nd-70 = 70(t-3) \n\nSubstituting the expression for t from above: \n\nd-70 = 70(2406060/(394830 - 9d) - 3) \n\nSimplifying the equation: \n\nd-70 = 1684200/(394830 - 9d) - 210 \n\nMultiplying both sides by (394830 - 9d): \n\nd(394830 - 9d) - 70(394830 - 9d) = 1684200 - 210(394830 - 9d) \n\nSimplifying the equation: \n\n-9d^2 + 3553470d - 2778300 = 0 \n\nUsing the quadratic formula: \n\nd = (3553470 \u00b1 sqrt(3553470^2 - 4(-9)(-2778300))) / (2(-9)) \n\nd = (3553470 \u00b1 sqrt(126000000900)) / 18 \n\nd = (3553470 \u00b1 11220030) / 18 \n\nd = 198526.67 or d = 630 \n\nWe can discard the solution d = 630 because it would mean that Kevin did not turn around at B, but instead continued driving past it. Therefore, the distance between A and B is approximately 198.5 miles. The closest answer choice is (A) 180, so that is the answer. The answer is A.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Since M is a three-digit number and N is its reverse, we can write: M = 100a + 10b + c N = 100c + 10b + a Since M > N, we have: 100a + 10b + c > 100c + 10b + a Simplifying the inequality: 99a > 99c a > c Since a and c are digits, the possible values for (a, c) are: (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8) There are 36 possible values for (a, c). For each pair (a, c), we can find the corresponding value of M: M = 100a + 10b + c We want to count how many values of M are more than 300. If a = 2, then the smallest possible value of M is 201, which is less than 300. If a = 3, then the smallest possible value of M is 301, which is the first value that satisfies the condition. If a > 3, then the smallest possible value of M is 400. Therefore, there are 7 possible values of a that satisfy the condition: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 For each value of a, there are 9 possible values of c (from 1 to 9, excluding a), and 10 possible values of b (from 0 to 9). Therefore, the total number of possible values of M is: 7 x 9 x 10 = 630 Finally, we need to check how many of these values satisfy the equation: M - N + 396c = 990 Substituting the expressions for M and N, we get: (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990 Simplifying the equation: 99a - 99c + 397c = 990 99a + 298c = 990 Dividing both sides by 11: 9a + 27c = 90 3a + 9c = 30 a + 3c = 10 Since a > c, the possible values for (a, c) that satisfy the equation are: (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 4), (7, 3), (8, 2), (9, 1) There are 6 possible values for (a, c) that satisfy the equation.

The formula for the area of a semi-circle is (\u03c0r^2)/2, where r is the radius. In this case, the radius is 10 cm (half of the diameter). So the area of each semi-circle is (\u03c0 x 10^2)/2 = 50\u03c0/2 = 25\u03c0. The total area of the two semi-circles is 50\u03c0. When the two semi-circles are cut out, the remaining paper is in the shape of a rectangle with two semi-circles removed from opposite sides. The length of the rectangle is equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm. The width of the rectangle is equal to the diameter of the semi-circle, which is also 20 cm.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's use J for Joe's age, S for Joe's sister's age, and F for Joe's father's age. \n\nFrom the first sentence, we know that: \n\nJ + S + F = 100 \n\nFrom the second sentence, we know that when Joe is as old as his father: \n\nJ + F = 2(S + 1) \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nJ + F = 2S + 2 \n\nFrom the third sentence, we know that when Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father: \n\nF = 2(S - F + J) \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n3F - 2J - 2S = 0 \n\nNow we have three equations with three variables.

Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. According to the problem, 75% of them take a winter vacation, which means that 75 employees take a winter vacation. Also, 40% of them take a winter and a summer vacation, which means that 40 employees take both vacations. We can use this information to create a Venn diagram:\n\n```\n         Winter vacation\n           /         \\\n          /           \\\n    Summer vacation   No summer vacation\n          |               |\n         40              35\n          |               |\n```\n\nWe know that 20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which means that 20 employees are outside the circles. We can use this information to fill in the rest of the diagram:\n\n```\n         Winter vacation\n           /         \\\n          /           \\\n    Summer vacation   No summer vacation\n          |               |\n         40              35\n          |               |\n         15              25\n```\n\nNow we can see that 15 employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. To find the percentage of employees that this represents, we can divide 15 by the total number of employees (100) and multiply by 100:\n\n15/100 * 100 = 15%\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 15%.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can solve this problem using a recursive approach. Let's define a function f(n) as the number of ways to reach the nth step. To reach the nth step, we can either take one step from the (n-1)th step or two steps from the (n-2)th step. Therefore, the total number of ways to reach the nth step is the sum of the number of ways to reach the (n-1)th step and the number of ways to reach the (n-2)th step. In other words, we have the following recursive formula:\n\nf(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)\n\nWe also know that f(1) = 1 (there is only one way to reach the first step) and f(2) = 2 (we can either take two steps from the first step or take one step twice).\n\nUsing this recursive formula, we can calculate f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3, f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 3 + 2 = 5, f(5) = f(4) + f(3) = 5 + 3 = 8, and so on.\n\nWe can continue this process until we reach f(10), which is the answer to the problem. Using the recursive formula, we get:\n\nf(10) = f(9) + f(8)\nf(9) = f(8) + f(7)\nf(8) = f(7) + f(6)\nf(7) = f(6) + f(5)\nf(6) = f(5) + f(4)\nf(5) = f(4) + f(3)\nf(4) = f(3) + f(2)\nf(3) = f(2) + f(1)\n\nUsing the initial values f(1) = 1 and f(2) = 2, we can calculate all the values of f(n) up to f(10):\n\nf(1) = 1\nf(2) = 2\nf(3) = 3\nf(4) = 5\nf(5) = 8\nf(6) = 13\nf(7) = 21\nf(8) = 34\nf(9) = 55\nf(10) = 89\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 89.",

If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ? Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the amount of zinc and copper in 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y. For alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. So, out of 40 grams of alloy X, 2/5 x 40 = 16 grams is zinc and 3/5 x 40 = 24 grams is copper. For alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which does not simplify. So, out of 60 grams of alloy Y, 7/18 x 60 = 23.33 grams is zinc (rounded to two decimal places) and 11/18 x 60 = 36.67 grams is copper (rounded to two decimal places). \n\nNow, we can add the amounts of zinc and copper in alloy Z: 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams of zinc and 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams of copper. \n\nFinally, we can simplify the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z: \n\n39.33 : 60.67 \n\nDividing both sides by 0.67 (the common factor), we get: \n\n59 : 91 \n\nTherefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 59:91. The answer is (B) 59:91.",

Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42%",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the wholesale cost of the appliance is $100. Then, the original retail price would be 60% more than the wholesale cost, which is $100 + 60% of $100 = $160. \n\nHowever, the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, which is 20% of $160 = $32 less than $160. Therefore, the selling price of the appliance is $160 - $32 = $128. \n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage that the appliance was sold for more than its wholesale cost: \n\n($128 - $100) / $100 x 100% = 28% \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 28%.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the breadth of the rectangular piece is x meters. Then, according to the problem, the length is (4x + 1) meters. We know that the area of the rectangular piece is 150 sq m, so we can set up the equation: x(4x + 1) = 150 Simplifying the equation: 4x^2 + x - 150 = 0 We can solve for x using the quadratic formula: x = (-1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 4(4)(150))) / (2(4)) x = (-1 \u00b1 31) / 8 We can ignore the negative solution, so: x = 5 Therefore, the breadth is 5 meters and the length is 21 meters.

Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the total number of steps in the staircase is 'S'. Let's also assume that the speed of the elevator is 'E' steps/minute and the time taken by the elevator to cover one floor is 'T' minutes. \n\nAccording to the problem, if you walk 20 steps and stop, you reach the bottom in 10 minutes. This means that the elevator covers (S-20) steps in 10 minutes. Therefore, we can write:\n\n(S-20)/E = 10\n\nSimilarly, if you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach the ground in 20 minutes. This means that the elevator covers (S-10) steps in 20 minutes. Therefore, we can write:\n\n(S-10)/E = 20\n\nWe can solve these two equations to find the values of 'S' and 'E'. First, we can simplify the equations:\n\nS/E - 20/E = 10\nS/E - 10/E = 20/ \n\nAdding these two equations, we get:\n\n2S/E = 30\n\nS/E = 15\n\nSubstituting this value of S/E in one of the equations, we get:\n\n15 - 20/E = 10\n\n20/E = 5\n\nE = 4\n\nTherefore, the speed of the elevator is 4 steps/minute.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can use the concept of similar triangles to solve this problem. The ratio of the height of the pole to the length of its shadow is the same as the ratio of the height of the tree to the length of its shadow. So we can set up the proportion: height of pole / length of pole shadow = height of tree / length of tree shadow Plugging in the values we know: 14 / 10 = h / 15 Solving for h: h = 14 x 15 / 10 h = 21 Therefore, the height of the tree is 21 meters.

If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The volume of the coin is the volume of a cylinder: V = \u03c0r^2h = \u03c0(7.5)^2(2) = 352.5\u03c0 mm^3\n\nLet the fraction of the coin that is aluminum be x. Then the fraction that is silver is (1-x).\n\nSince the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver, we have:\n\nxV = (1-x)V\nx = 1-x\nx = 0.5\n\nSo half of the coin is aluminum and half is silver.\n\nLet the weight of the aluminum coin be w. Then the weight of the aluminum in the alloy coin is 0.5w.\n\nSince silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of the silver in the alloy coin is 2(0.5w) = w.\n\nSo the total weight of the alloy coin is 1.5w = 30 g.\n\nTherefore, the weight of the aluminum coin with the same volume is:\n\nw = (30/1.5)(0.5) = 10 g\n\nFinally, we need to find the weight of a coin with the same volume as the alloy coin but with dimensions 1 x 30 mm. Since the coin is a cylinder, its volume is:\n\nV = \u03c0r^2h = \u03c0(15/2)^2(1) = 176.25\u03c0 mm^3\n\nThe density of aluminum is 2.7 g/cm^3, so the mass of the aluminum coin is:\n\nm = (176.25\u03c0)(2.7)(10^-3) = 0.476 g\n\nTherefore, the weight of the aluminum coin is:\n\nw = (0.476)(1000) = 476 g\n\nHowever, this answer is not among the answer choices.
