Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 18 (C) 17 (D) 21 (E) 23\n\nA: Let's think step by step. The difference between 5 and 8 is 3, between 8 and 10 is 2, between 10 and 12 is 2, and between 12 and 16 is 4. So, it seems like the differences are not following a specific pattern. To find the missing number, we can try to look for other patterns. One possible pattern is that the numbers are increasing by 1, then 2, then 2, then 4, and so on. Following this pattern, the next number should increase by 4, making it 16 + 4 = 20. However, this number is not among the answer choices. The closest answer choice is (D) 21, which is an increase of 5 from the previous number. This pattern is also possible, as it would be an increase of 1, then 2, then 2, then 5. Therefore, the answer is (D) 21. The answer is D.\n\nQ: A boat can travel with a speed of 22 km/hr in still water. If the speed of the stream is 5 km/hr, find the time taken by the boat to go 108 km downstream Answer Choices: (A) 5 hours (B) 4 hours (C) 3 hours (D) 2 hours (E) None of these\n\nA: Let's think step by step. The boat's speed in downstream = (speed of boat in still water) + (speed of stream) = 22 + 5 = 27 km/hr. Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. So, the time taken by the boat to go 108 km downstream = 108 / 27 = 4 hours. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 4 hours. The answer is B.\n\nQ: 5 persons A,B,C,D and E occupy seats in a row at random. What is the probability that A and B sit next to each other ? Answer Choices: (A) 3/5 (B) 2/5 (C) 1/5 (D) 8/5 (E) None of these\n\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 5 people, so there are 5! = 120 ways to arrange them in a row. Now, let's consider A and B as a single entity, AB. Then, there are 4! = 24 ways to arrange the entities AB, C, D, and E in a row. However, within the entity AB, there are 2! = 2 ways to arrange A and B. So, there are 2 x 4! = 48 ways for A and B to sit next to each other. Therefore, the probability of A and B sitting next to each other is 48/120 = 2/5. The correct answer is (B) 2/5. The answer is B.\n\nQ: 12+6=792\n10+2=110\n1+9=9\n2+7=16\n11+4=??\nSolve it? Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 120 (C) 190 (D) 160 (E) 154\n\nA: Let's think step by step. In the first equation, 12+6=18. In the second equation, 10+2=12. In the third equation, 1+9=10. In the fourth equation, 2+7=9. To solve the fifth equation, we need to find a pattern in the given equations. We can see that the sum of the two numbers in each equation is multiplied by the second number to get the answer. For example, in the first equation, (12+6) x 6 = 108, which is the answer. Using the same pattern, we can solve the fifth equation: (11+4) x 4 = 60. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct. The answer is No answer.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step."

If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A are x grams and y grams respectively. Then, from the given information, we can write:\n\n0.09 grams of vitamin E = 1 gram of health food\n0.08 grams of vitamin A = 1 gram of health food\n\nTo get at least x grams of vitamin E and y grams of vitamin A, we need to eat:\n\nx / 0.09 grams of health food\ny / 0.08 grams of health food\n\nSince we need to eat the same food to get both vitamins, we can set these two expressions equal to each other:\n\nx / 0.09 = y / 0.08\n\nSolving for y, we get:\n\ny = 0.08x / 0.09 = 8x / 9\n\nSo, we need to eat 8x / 9 grams of health food to get at least x grams of vitamin E and y grams of vitamin A. Since we want to get both vitamins at their minimum daily requirement, we can assume that x and y are equal. Therefore, we need to eat:\n\n8x / 9 = 8y / 9 = 8(x + y) / 9\n\ngrams of health food daily. Since x + y is the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we can substitute it with a single variable, say z. Therefore, we need to eat:\n\n8z / 9 grams of health food daily\n\nto get at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins. Now, we just need to substitute the values of x and y with the given percentages:\n\n0.09z grams of vitamin E\n0.08z grams of vitamin A\n\nSince we need to eat the same food to get both vitamins, we can add the grams of health food required to get each vitamin:\n\n0.09z + 0.08z = 0.17z\n\nTherefore, we need to eat:\n\n0.17z grams of health food daily\n\nto get at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins. Now, we just need to solve for z:\n\n0.17z = 1 (since 1 gram of health food contains the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins)\n\nz = 1 / 0.17 = 5.88\n\nTherefore, we need to eat 5.88 grams of health food daily to get at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.

Let the number of men required be M. Then, we can say that:\n\nWork done by M men in 1/2 day = W\n\nWork done by M men in 1 day = 2W\n\nWe know that the amount of work done in 1 day is directly proportional to the number of men working on it.

Therefore, we can fill in the second row as:\n\nM A D\nR A E\n\nNext, we can use the second column to find the value of R. We know that A times M is equal to MA in the second row.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each, so the revenue from the sale of pens is 7200 x 10 = Rs. 72,000. The company estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%, so the total profit is 25% of the revenue, which is 0.25 x 72,000 = Rs. 18,000.\n\nNow, let's find the cost of manufacturing all the pens. Since 10% of the produced pens are always defective, the company needs to produce 7200 / (1 - 0.1) = 8000 pens to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler. Let the cost of manufacturing each pen be x. Then, the total cost of manufacturing 8000 pens is 8000x.\n\nThe profit is the revenue minus the cost, so we have:\n\n18,000 = 72,000 - 8000x\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = (72,000 - 18,000) / 8000 = Rs. 6\n\nTherefore, the manufactured cost of each pen is Rs. 6.

Answer Choices: (A) 43 seconds (B) 39 seconds (C) 20 seconds (D) 33 seconds (E) 55 seconds",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, which is 1 mile long. This means that the front of the train enters the tunnel at a speed of 1/3 miles per second. \n\nNow, we need to find out how long it takes for the back of the train to exit the tunnel. Since the train is traveling at 120 miles per hour, we can convert this to miles per second by dividing by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour): \n\n120 miles per hour = 120/3600 miles per second = 1/30 miles per second \n\nSo, the back of the train will exit the tunnel at a speed of 1/30 miles per second. \n\nSince the tunnel is 1 mile long, the front of the train has to travel 2 miles (1 mile to reach the end of the tunnel, and 1 mile to completely exit the tunnel). \n\nUsing the formula distance = rate x time, we can find the time it takes for the front of the train to travel 2 miles: \n\n2 miles = (1/3 miles per second) x time \n\ntime = 6 seconds \n\nTherefore, it takes 6 seconds for the front of the train to completely exit the tunnel. \n\nUsing the same formula, we can find the time it takes for the back of the train to travel 2 miles: \n\n2 miles = (1/30 miles per second) x time \n\ntime = 60 seconds \n\nTherefore, it takes 60 seconds for the back of the train to completely exit the tunnel. \n\nSo, the total time it takes for the train to completely pass through the tunnel is the sum of the time it takes for the front and back of the train to exit the tunnel: \n\n6 seconds + 60 seconds = 66 seconds \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is None of the above.",

So, we can write:\n\n54 = (51x + 78) / (x+1)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (x+1), we get:\n\n54(x+1) = 51x + 78\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\n54x + 54 = 51x + 78\n\nSubtracting 51x from both sides, we get:\n\n3x + 54 = 78\n\nSubtracting 54 from both sides, we get:\n\n3x = 24\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\n\nx = 8\n\nTherefore, Sachin played 8 matches before the finals. Adding the final match, he played a total of 9 matches in the season. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 9. The answer is C.",

The area of the rectangular piece is (x-4) x x = x^2 - 4x. When this rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half, we get two congruent triangles, each with area 70 square feet. So, the area of each triangle is (1/2) base x height = (1/2) (x-4) (x/2) = 35. Simplifying this equation, we get x^2 - 8x - 280 = 0. Factoring this equation, we get (x-20) (x+14) = 0.

To find the distance between A and home, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the distance between A and home is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of 5 km and 3 km.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet be l and b respectively. When folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm. This means that the length of each part is (48/2) - b = 24 - b, and the breadth of each part is l. Therefore, the area of each part is A1 = l(24 - b). When folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm. This means that the length of each part is (66/2) - l = 33 - l, and the breadth of each part is b. Therefore, the area of each part is A2 = b(33 - l). Since the sheet is folded into two equal halves, A1 = A2. So, we can equate the two expressions for A and simplify:\n\nl(24 - b) = b(33 - l)\n24l - l*b = 33b - l*b\n24l = 33b\nl/b = 33/24 = 11/8\n\nWe can use this ratio to eliminate one of the variables and express the area in terms of the other variable:\n\nl = (11/8)b\nA = lb = (11/8)b^2\n\nNow, we can use the given information to find the value of b:\n\n2(24 + l) = 48\n24 + l = 24\nl = 0\n\nThis is not a valid solution, since the length cannot be zero.

Similarly, we need to assume that all the students studying bio are different from all the students studying English. This gives us the maximum number of students as:\n\nMaximum number of students = (1/16)x + (1/10)x + (1/8)x - (1/80)x\n= (31/160)x\n\nTo find the minimum number of students, we need to assume that some students may be studying more than one subject.

Then, we can use the given information to form equations:\n\n- Neha is 12th from the left end: this means there are 11 children to Neha's left. So, Neha's position after shifting 2 places to the right would be (12+2) = 14th from the left end.\n- Radha is 6th from the right end: this means there are 5 children to Radha's right. So, Radha's position after shifting 2 places to the left would be (6-2) = 4th from the right end.\n- There are 6 children between Radha and Neha after they are shifted: this means there are (6-1) = 5 children between Radha and Neha before they are shifted.\n\nNow, we can use this information to form another equation:\n\n- The distance between Radha and Neha after they are shifted is (14-4+1) = 11. This is because Neha is now the 14th child from the left end, and Radha is now the 4th child from the right end, so there are 13 children between them. However, we are told that there are 6 children between them, so we need to subtract 6 from 13 to get 7. But we need to add 1 to get the distance, so the distance is 7+1 = 8.\n- The distance between Radha and Neha before they are shifted is 8-4 = 4. This is because there are 5 children between them, so the distance between them is 5+1 = 6. But we need to subtract 2 from this distance because both of them are shifted 2 places, so the distance between them before shifting is 6-2 = 4.\n\nNow, we can form the final equation:\n\n- 11 + 5 + 4 = x\n- Simplifying, we get x = 20\n\nTherefore, the total number of children in the row is 20.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can get a 4% discount if he pays within 30 days, or he can pay the full amount within n days and get no discount. To take advantage of the discount, the merchant needs to pay within 30 days, which means he needs to pay $20,000 - 4% of $20,000 = $19,200. \n\nLet's assume that the merchant borrows the money to pay for the boat and pays it back within 30 days. The interest he pays on the loan is the cost of borrowing the money. Let's say he borrows the money at a simple interest rate of r%. Then, the interest he pays after 30 days is:\n\nInterest = Principal x Rate x Time\nInterest = $19,200 x r% x (30/365)\nInterest = $499.45r\n\nThe highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow the money is the rate that makes the interest he pays equal to or less than the discount he gets. \n\nDiscount = $20,000 x 4% = $800\n\n$499.45r \u2264 $800\n\nr \u2264 $800 / $499.45\n\nr \u2264 1.601%\n\nTherefore, the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money is 1.601%, which is closest to (D) 1.567%.

We know that:\n\nA + B + C = 17   ...(1)\nA^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109   ...(2)\n\nFrom equation (1), we can write:\n\nC = 17 - A - B\n\nSubstituting this value of C in equation (2), we get:\n\nA^2 + B^2 + (17 - A - B)^2 = 109\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2A^2 + 2B^2 - 34A - 34B + 138 = 0\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nA^2 + B^2 - 17A - 17B + 69 = 0\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as:\n\n(A - 8.5)^2 + (B - 8.5)^2 = 15.25\n\nThis is the equation of a circle with center (8.5, 8.5) and radius sqrt(15.25) = 3.5. The possible integer solutions for A and B lie on this circle. We can check each of these solutions to see if they satisfy equation (1). The possible solutions are:\n\nA = 1, B = 7\nA = 2, B = 6\nA = 6, B = 2\nA = 7, B = 1\n\nOut of these solutions, only A = 6 and B = 2 satisfy equation (1). Therefore, C = 17 - A - B = 9. So, the original number is 629. When we subtract 495 from this number, we get 134, which is the same as 431 in reverse order. Therefore, the answer is (C) 288.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's denote the weight of the new man by x. Then, we can use the formula for average: average = (sum of weights) / (number of weights). \n\nInitially, the sum of weights is the weight of 10 oarsmen, which is 10 times the average weight. Let's denote the initial average weight by A. Then, the sum of weights is 10A.\n\nAfter the replacement, the sum of weights is the weight of 9 oarsmen plus the weight of the new man, which is 9 times the average weight plus x. Let's denote the new average weight by B. Then, the sum of weights is 9B + x.\n\nWe know that the new average weight is increased by 1.8 kg, so we can write:\n\nB = A + 1.8\n\nWe also know that the sum of weights is conserved, so we can write:\n\n10A = 9B + x\n\nNow, we can substitute B in terms of A:\n\n10A = 9(A + 1.8) + x\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n10A = 9A + 16.2 + x\n\nx = 10A - 9A - 16.2\n\nx = A - 16.2\n\nTherefore, we need to find the initial average weight A. We know that:\n\nB = A + 1.8\n\nSo, we can write:\n\nA = B - 1.8\n\nWe also know that the weight of the crew member who was replaced is 53 kg, so we can write:\n\n10A - 53 = 9B + x - 53\n\nSubstituting A in terms of B and x, we get:\n\n10(B - 1.8) - 53 = 9B + x - 53\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx = B - 18\n\nNow, we need to eliminate B from these two equations. Substituting B in terms of A, we get:\n\nx = A - 16.2 - 18\n\nx = A - 34.2\n\nSubstituting this in the equation x = B - 18, we get:\n\nA - 34.2 = B - 18\n\nB = A + 16.2\n\nSubstituting this in the equation B = A + 1.8, we get:\n\nA + 1.8 = A + 16.2\n\nSubtracting A from both sides, we get:\n\n1.8 = 16.2\n\nThis is not possible, so there must be an error in the problem statement or in the answer choices.

Let's use the formula: \n\n(rate of hose A) + (rate of hose B) = (rate of both hoses working together) \n\nThe rate of hose A is 1/8 (since it can fill the pool in 8 hours). We don't know the rate of hose B, so let's call it 1/x. The rate of both hoses working together is 1/3 (since they can fill the pool in 3 hours). \n\nSo, we can write: \n\n1/8 + 1/x = 1/3 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 24x (the least common multiple of 8, x, and 3), we get: \n\n3x + 24 = 8x \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx = 8 \n\nTherefore, hose B can fill the entire pool in 8 hours.

Let's call the number of students who are only members of the swim team as x. Then, the number of students who are members of the swim team (with or without the chess club) is (x + 24). \n\nNow, we know that 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club. This means that 80% of members of the swim team are members of the chess club. So, we can write an equation:\n\n0.8(x + 24) = x\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n0.8x + 19.2 = x\n\n0.2x = 19.2\n\nx = 96\n\nTherefore, there are 96 students who are only members of the swim team, and 24 students who are members of both the chess club and the swim team.

Then, Smolapon can influence (30 - x) senators with his $4,000 contribution. \n\nThe total number of senators they can influence is the sum of the senators each can influence: \n\nx + (30 - x) = 30 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n30 - x + x = 30 \n\nTherefore, the number of senators Hoopsmot can influence is x = 30 - (30 - x) = x. \n\nNow, we need to find the value of x. \n\nWe know that Hoopsmot contributed $16,000, which is 4 times the amount contributed by Smolapon.

Now, we can use the formula for simple interest: I = (P x R x T) / 100, where I is the interest, P is the principal (borrowed amount), R is the interest rate, and T is the time (in years). Here, P = Rs.360, I = Rs.18, and T = 1 year (since the loan is for 1 year). Substituting these values in the formula, we get: 18 = (360 x R x 1) / 100.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the length of the yard is L and the width is W. We know that the area of the yard is 240 square meters, so we have:\n\nL x W = 240\n\nWe also know that Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the yard, which means she needs to fence the perimeter of the yard except for the side that is already 10 meters long. The perimeter of the yard is:\n\n2L + W\n\nSince one side is already 10 meters long, Alice only needs to fence the other three sides, which have a total length of:\n\n2L + W - 10\n\nWe can rewrite the equation for the area of the yard as:\n\nW = 240 / L\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for the perimeter, we get:\n\n2L + (240 / L) - 10\n\nTo find the value of L that minimizes the length of fencing needed, we can take the derivative of this expression with respect to L and set it equal to zero:\n\n2 - (240 / L^2) = 0\n\nSolving for L, we get:\n\nL = sqrt(240/2) = 10 sqrt(6)\n\nSubstituting this value back into the expression for the perimeter, we get:\n\n2L + (240 / L) - 10 = 20 sqrt(6) + 24 / sqrt(6) - 10 = 20 sqrt(6) + 4 sqrt(6) - 10 sqrt(6) = 14 sqrt(6)\n\nTherefore, Alice needs 14 sqrt(6) meters of fencing.

Let's also assume that they meet after t hours. \n\nIn that time, the ship would have traveled a distance of 180 miles at a speed of x miles per hour. So, the distance traveled by the ship is:\n\nDistance traveled by ship = Speed of ship x Time taken = x * t\n\nSimilarly, the distance traveled by the plane is:\n\nDistance traveled by plane = Speed of plane x Time taken = 10x * t\n\nWhen they meet, the total distance traveled by both of them is the distance between them from the starting point.

Similarly, Karen's rate of earning tips is 1/4 of the cost of the cake per hour. Let's denote the cost of the cake as C. Then, Sharon's rate is C/5 per hour, and Karen's rate is C/4 per hour. \n\nWhen they work together, their rates add up. So, their combined rate is (C/5) + (C/4) per hour. We can simplify this to (9C/20) per hour. \n\nTo find the time it takes for them to earn enough tips to buy the cake together, we can use the formula: time = amount / rate.

            "Question": "Q: An electric pole, 14 metres high, casts a shadow of 10 metres. Find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions. Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 22 (C) 20 (D) 23 (E) 24",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The height of the electric pole and the height of the tree are proportional to their respective shadows. So, we can set up a proportion:\n\nheight of pole / length of pole's shadow = height of tree / length of tree's shadow\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n14 / 10 = x / 15\n\nwhere x is the height of the tree.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nx = (14 / 10) x 15 = 21\n\nTherefore, the height of the tree is 21 meters. The correct answer is (A) 21.",

            "Question": "Q: A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The volume of the coin made of alloy is the volume of a cylinder with height 2 mm and radius 7.5 mm (half of the diameter). So, the volume is \u03c0 x (7.5 mm)^2 x 2 mm = 352.5 mm^3. Since the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, each metal occupies half of the volume, or 176.25 mm^3. Let's call the density of aluminum \"d\". Then, the weight of the aluminum in the coin is d x 176.25 g. Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, its density is 2d. Therefore, the weight of the silver in the coin is (2d) x 176.25 g = 352.5d g. The total weight of the coin is 30 g, so we have the equation:\n\nd x 176.25 g + 352.5d g = 30 g\n\nSimplifying and solving for d, we get:\n\nd = 0.06 g/mm^3\n\nNow, let's find the volume of the pure aluminum coin. It is also a cylinder, but with height 1 mm and radius 15/2 = 7.5 mm. So, the volume is \u03c0 x (7.5 mm)^2 x 1 mm = 176.625 mm^3. The density of aluminum is 0.06 g/mm^3, so the weight of the pure aluminum coin is:\n\n0.06 g/mm^3 x 176.625 mm^3 = 10.5975 g\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) 10.6 grams (rounded to one decimal place). The answer is E.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "There are a total of 5 horses, so there are 5C2 = 10 ways to select two horses out of five. Out of these 10 ways, there is only one way to select the winning horse. Therefore, the probability of Mr. Jain selecting the winning horse is 1/10. However, the answer choices do not include this option. The closest option is (A) 1/5, which is the probability of selecting any one horse out of five. This is not the same as the probability of selecting the winning horse.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The worst-case scenario is that we pick one tie of each color, which would give us a total of 8+13+10+5+4 = 40 ties. However, if we pick one more tie, we are guaranteed to have at least two ties of the same color. So, the answer is (B) 3. We can pick any three ties, and by the pigeonhole principle, at least two of them will be of the same color. Therefore, we need to take out at least 3 ties from the rack. The answer is (B) 3.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "The diameter of the sphere is equal to the diagonal of the rectangular solid. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the diagonal of the rectangular solid:\n\nd^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2\nd^2 = 9 + 16 + 225\nd^2 = 250\nd = sqrt(250)\nd = 5sqrt(10)\n\nTherefore, the diameter of the sphere is 2d = 10sqrt(10). Rounding to four decimal places, we get 22.3607, which is closest to (E) 20.8888. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 20.8888. The answer is E.",
