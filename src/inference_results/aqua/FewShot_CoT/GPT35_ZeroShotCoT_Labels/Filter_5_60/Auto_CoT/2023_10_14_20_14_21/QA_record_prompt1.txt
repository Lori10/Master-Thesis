Answer Choices: (A) A) 2 (B) B) 4 (C) C) 5 (D) D) 7 (E) E) 8\n\nA: Let's think step by step. We need to find the numbers from 2 to 8 that are exactly divisible by 2. Divisible by 2 means that the number can be divided by 2 without leaving any remainder. The numbers from 2 to 8 are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Out of these, the numbers that are exactly divisible by 2 are: 2, 4, 6, 8. So, the answer is (B) 4. The answer is B.\n\nQ: Mohit sold an article for Rs. 18000. Had he offered a discount of 10% on the selling price, he would have earned a profit of 8%. What is the cost price of the article? Answer Choices: (A) 15000 (B) 15002 (C) 26879 (D) 26992 (E) 12681\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the cost price of the article be x. If Mohit had offered a discount of 10%, the selling price would have been 90% of the original selling price, which is 0.9 * 18000 = 16200. If he had earned a profit of 8%, the cost price would have been (16200/1.08) = 15000. Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 15000. The correct answer is (A) 15000. The answer is A.\n\nQ: A person crosses a 600 m long street in 2 minutes. What is his speed in km per hour? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 24 (C) 18 (D) 42 (E) 64\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the distance from meters to kilometers. We can do this by dividing 600 by 1000, which gives us 0.6 km. Next, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. We can do this by dividing 2 by 60, which gives us 0.0333 hours (rounded to four decimal places). Finally, we can calculate the speed by dividing the distance by the time. So, speed = distance/time = 0.6/0.0333 = 18 (rounded to the nearest whole number). Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 18. The answer is C.\n\nQ: What are the number of ways to select 3 men and 2 women such that one man and one woman are always selected? Answer Choices: (A) 26 ways (B) 19 ways (C) 30 ways (D) 76 ways (E) 15 ways\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to select one man from the available men, which can be done in C(3,1) ways. Then, we need to select one woman from the available women, which can be done in C(2,1) ways. Next, we need to select the remaining 1 man and 1 woman from the remaining pool of men and women. This can be done in C(2,1) * C(1,1) ways. Therefore, the total number of ways to select 3 men and 2 women such that one man and one woman are always selected is: C(3,1) * C(2,1) * C(2,1) * C(1,1) = 3 * 2 * 2 * 1 = 12 ways None of the answer choices match the correct answer of 12 ways. The answer is C.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step."

Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the jar has a total of 10 units of candies (just for ease of calculation). \n\nP can eat 1 unit of candies in 10 minutes, so he can eat the entire jar in 100 minutes. \n\nQ can eat half the jar (i.e., 5 units of candies) in 5 minutes. So, she can eat the entire jar in 10 minutes. \n\nNow, let's assume that P and Q together can eat x units of candies in y minutes. \n\nWe know that P can eat 1 unit of candies in 10 minutes, so he can eat x units of candies in 10x minutes. \n\nSimilarly, Q can eat 1 unit of candies in 10 minutes, so she can eat (2/x) units of candies in 10 minutes. \n\nSince Q can eat half the jar in 5 minutes, we know that (2/x) * 5 = 5, which gives us x = 2. \n\nSo, together, P and Q can eat 2 units of candies in y minutes. \n\nWe can set up a proportion to solve for y: \n\n1/10 + 1/10 = 2/y \n\nSimplifying this, we get: \n\ny = 6.67 minutes (rounded to two decimal places) \n\nTherefore, it would take P and Q approximately 6.67 minutes to empty the jar.

Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A are x grams and y grams respectively. \n\nFrom the given information, we know that 1 gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. \n\nSo, 0.09x grams of vitamin E and 0.08y grams of vitamin A are present in 1 gram of the health food. \n\nTo get the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to eat enough grams of the health food such that the amount of vitamin E and vitamin A obtained from it is at least x grams and y grams respectively. \n\nLet's assume that we need to eat a grams of the health food to get the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins. \n\nSo, we have the following equations: \n\n0.09a >= x   (to get the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E)\n0.08a >= y   (to get the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A)\n\nWe need to find the value of a that satisfies both these equations. \n\nDividing both sides of the first equation by 0.09 and both sides of the second equation by 0.08, we get: \n\na >= x/0.09\na >= y/0.08\n\nTo satisfy both these inequalities, we need to take the larger value between x/0.09 and y/0.08. \n\nSo, a >= max(x/0.09, y/0.08)\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of a that satisfies both the equations is max(x/0.09, y/0.08). \n\nLet's assume that x = 100 grams and y = 120 grams (just as an example). \n\nSo, a >= max(100/0.09, 120/0.08) \n\na >= max(1111.11, 1500) \n\na >= 1500 \n\nTherefore, we need to eat at least 1500 grams of the health food daily to get the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins. \n\nHowever, none of the answer choices match this value.

We are given that the profit earned with a discount of 7% is Rs. 15 less than the profit earned with a discount of 5%. Let the profit earned with a discount of 5% be y. Then, the profit earned with a discount of 7% would be (y - 15). We know that profit = selling price - cost price. Therefore, we can write two equations based on the profit earned with a discount of 5% and 7% respectively:\n\ny = 0.95x - cost price\n(y - 15) = 0.93x - cost price\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get:\n\n15 = 0.02x\nx = 750\n\nTherefore, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750.

After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's start by finding the total amount of work required to paint 3 houses. Let's assume that the work required to paint one house is 1 unit. So, the total work required to paint 3 houses is 3 units.\n\nNext, let's find the rate of work of each painter. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so his rate of work is 1/6 units per day. Mr.Black can paint a house in 8 days, so his rate of work is 1/8 units per day. Mr.Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so his rate of work is 1/12 units per day.\n\nNow, let's find the total work done by Mr.Brown and Mr.Black in the first 8 days. Mr.Brown's rate of work is 1/6 units per day, so in 8 days he can complete 8*(1/6) = 4/3 units of work. Mr.Black's rate of work is 1/8 units per day, so in 8 days he can complete 8*(1/8) = 1 unit of work. Therefore, the total work done by Mr.Brown and Mr.Black in the first 8 days is (4/3 + 1) = 7/3 units.\n\nAfter 8 days, Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr.Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. During this period, Mr.Black's rate of work is 1/8 units per day. Therefore, in 6 days, he can complete 6*(1/8) = 3/4 units of work.\n\nThe total work done by Mr.Brown, Mr.Black, and Mr.Blue is 3 units. We know that the total work done by Mr.Brown and Mr.Black in the first 8 days is 7/3 units, and the total work done by Mr.Black in the next 6 days is 3/4 units. Therefore, the total work done by Mr.Blue is:\n\n3 - (7/3 + 3/4) = 12/4 - (28/12 + 9/12) = 3 - (37/12) = 11/12 units.\n\nFinally, we can find the time taken by Mr.Blue to complete the remaining work of 11/12 units. Mr.Blue's rate of work is 1/12 units per day. Therefore, the time taken by Mr.Blue to complete the remaining work is:\n\n(11/12) / (1/12) = 11 days.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 11.

There are C(4,2) = 6 ways to select 2 candy bars from the 4 that cost $2, and C(4,3) = 4 ways to select 3 candy bars from the 4 that cost $2. \n\nNext, let's consider the candy bars that cost $1 each.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can simplify the expression 727+728+729 as 3*728. Now, we need to find three consecutive integers whose product is 3*728. Let's assume the middle integer is x. Then, the three consecutive integers are x-1, x, and x+1. Their product is (x-1)*x*(x+1) = x^3 - x. We know that x^3 - x = 3*728. We can simplify this equation as x(x^2 - 1) = 3*728. We can factor x^2 - 1 as (x-1)(x+1). Therefore, we have x(x-1)(x+1) = 3*2*2*2*7*13. Since x, x-1, and x+1 are consecutive integers, one of them must be divisible by 3 and one of them must be divisible by 2. Also, x cannot be divisible by 5 or 13, since the prime factorization of 3*2*2*2*7*13 does not contain 5 or 13. Therefore, we can try different values of x that satisfy these conditions. We can start with x = 13, which gives us x(x-1)(x+1) = 13*12*14 = 2184, which is not equal to 3*728. We can try x = 14, which gives us x(x-1)(x+1) = 14*13*15 = 2730, which is greater than 3*728. We can try x = 15, which gives us x(x-1)(x+1) = 15*14*16 = 3360, which is greater than 3*728. We can try x = 16, which gives us x(x-1)(x+1) = 16*15*17 = 4080, which is greater than 3*728.

We can try x = 19, which gives us x(x-1)(x+1) = 19*18*20 = 6840, which is greater than 3*728. We can try x = 20, which gives us x(x-1)(x+1) = 20*19*21 = 7980, which is greater than 3*728. We can try x = 21, which gives us x(x-1)(x+1) = 21*20*22 = 9240, which is greater than 3*728. We can try x = 22, which gives us x(x-1)(x+1) = 22*21*23 = 10626, which is greater than 3*728. We can try x = 23, which gives us x(x-1)(x+1) = 23*22*24 = 12144, which is greater than 3*728. We can try x = 24, which gives us x(x-1)(x+1) = 24*23*25 = 13800, which is greater than 3*728.

We can try x = 27, which gives us x(x-1)(x+1) = 27*26*28 = 19656, which is greater than 3*728. We can try x = 28, which gives us x(x-1)(x+1) = 28*27*29 = 21924, which is greater than 3*728.

Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade is equal to the circumference of the circle that the point traces out as the fan rotates. The radius of this circle is 10 centimeters, so the circumference is 2*pi*10 = 20*pi centimeters. \n\nTo find the number of revolutions that the fan makes in 30 seconds, we need to convert the rate of 300 revolutions per minute to revolutions per second. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so the fan makes 300/60 = 5 revolutions per second. Therefore, in 30 seconds, the fan makes 5*30 = 150 revolutions. \n\nSo, the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade in 30 seconds is equal to the circumference of the circle traced out by the point multiplied by the number of revolutions made by the fan in that time. \n\nDistance traveled = 20*pi * 150 = 3000*pi centimeters. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 3000pi.

Train M takes 4 hours to travel from City A to City B, while Train N takes 3.5 hours to travel from City B to City A.

At this time, Train M has been traveling for t hours, while Train N has been traveling for (t - 1.5) hours. \n\nSince the two trains meet each other, the total distance traveled by both trains is equal to the distance between City A and City B, which is the same for both trains. Let's assume that this distance is d. \n\nThe distance traveled by Train M in t hours is given by the formula d = rM * t, where rM is the speed of Train M. Similarly, the distance traveled by Train N in (t - 1.5) hours is given by the formula d = rN * (t - 1.5), where rN is the speed of Train N. \n\nSince the two distances are equal, we can equate the two formulas and solve for t: \n\nrM * t = rN * (t - 1.5) \n\nrM * t = rN * t - 1.5 * rN \n\nt * (rM - rN) = 1.5 * rN \n\nt = 1.5 * rN / (rM - rN) \n\nWe don't know the speeds of the two trains, but we do know that the distance between City A and City B is 4 hours of travel for Train M and 3.5 hours of travel for Train N.

Let's assume that Train M travels at a speed of x km/h, while Train N travels at a speed of y km/h. \n\nThen, we have: \n\nrM = x km/h \n\nrN = y km/h \n\nWe also know that the distance between City A and City B is 600 km. \n\n4 * x = 600 \n\nx = 150 km/h \n\n3.5 * y = 600 \n\ny = 171.43 km/h \n\nNow we can substitute these values into the formula for t: \n\nt = 1.5 * 171.43 / (150 - 171.43) \n\nt = 1.5 * 171.43 / (-21.43) \n\nt = -11.25 \n\nThis doesn't make sense, since t should be a positive number. The reason for this is that the two trains are traveling in opposite directions, so we need to take the absolute value of t: \n\nt = | -11.25 | \n\nt = 11.25 \n\nTherefore, the two trains cross each other 11.25 hours after Train N starts, which is at 6:15 pm. \n\nThe answer is not among the answer choices.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can solve this problem using combinations. The total number of ways to select 2 balls from n balls is given by C(n,2) = n(n-1)/2. \n\nIf we exclude the ball marked 3, then we have n-1 balls to choose from.

Therefore, we can write:\n\nC(n,2) - C(n-1,2) = 45\n\nExpanding the combinations and simplifying, we get:\n\nn(n-1)/2 - (n-1)(n-2)/2 = 45\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\nn^2 - 3n + 2 = 90\n\nn^2 - 3n - 88 = 0\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation, we get:\n\n(n-11)(n+8) = 0\n\nTherefore, n = 11 or n = -8.

In that time, Train A would have covered a distance of 40t km, and Train B would have covered a distance of 72(t-3) km (since Train B departs 3 hours later than Train A). \n\nAt the point of their meeting, the total distance covered by both trains would be equal to the distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow, which is the total distance they need to cover. \n\nSo, we can write the equation: \n\n40t + 72(t-3) = distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n112t - 216 = distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow \n\nNow, we need to find the value of t, which will give us the time at which the two trains meet. \n\nWe know that Train A departs at 11 am and Train B departs at 2 pm, which is 3 hours later.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can start by finding the relative speed of the ants. Since they are moving towards each other, we can add their speeds to get the relative speed. So, relative speed = 9 + 6 = 15 cm per hour. \n\nNext, we can use the formula distance = speed x time to find the time taken for the ants to meet. Let's call this time t. The distance between the farms is 75 cm, so the total distance that the ants need to cover is 75 cm. \n\nSince they are moving towards each other, they will meet in the middle. So, the distance that ant A needs to travel to reach the meeting point is half of the total distance, which is 75/2 = 37.5 cm. \n\nUsing the formula distance = speed x time, we can find the time taken for ant A to travel this distance: \n\n37.5 = 9t \n\nt = 37.5/9 \n\nt = 4.1667 hours (rounded to four decimal places) \n\nNow that we know the time taken for the ants to meet, we can find the distance that ant A travels until meeting ant B: \n\ndistance = speed x time \n\ndistance = 9 x 4.1667 \n\ndistance = 37.5 (rounded to the nearest whole number) \n\nTherefore, the distance that ant A travels until meeting ant B is 37.5 cm.

Then, the time taken by Bob to reach X is also t hours. \n\nDistance covered by Allen in t hours = 54t km\nDistance covered by Bob in t hours = 78t km\n\nWhen they meet for the first time, the total distance covered by both of them is d km. Therefore, we can write:\n\n54t + 78t = d\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n132t = d\n\nWhen Allen reaches Y, he changes his direction and returns to X. Therefore, the distance between Y and X is covered twice by Allen. So, the total distance covered by Allen is:\n\n2 * (54t) = 108t km\n\nWhen Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Therefore, the distance between X and Y is covered twice by Bob.

The interest he pays on the loan will be the cost of borrowing the money. \n\nLet's say he borrows the full amount of $20,000 and pays it off in 30 days.

Let's call this measure x. \n\nWe also know that minor arc AC has a measure of 160\u00b0, so minor arc AB + minor arc BC + minor arc AC = 360\u00b0. Substituting x for minor arc AB and minor arc BC, we get:\n\nx + x + 160\u00b0 = 360\u00b0\n2x + 160\u00b0 = 360\u00b0\n2x = 200\u00b0\nx = 100\u00b0\n\nSo, minor arc AB and minor arc BC both have a measure of 100\u00b0. \n\nNow, we know that minor arc BD has a measure of 150\u00b0, and we want to find the measure of minor arc AD. We can use the fact that the sum of the measures of minor arcs AB, BD, and DA is equal to 360\u00b0. Substituting the values we know, we get:\n\n100\u00b0 + 150\u00b0 + minor arc AD = 360\u00b0\nminor arc AD = 110\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the measure of minor arc AD is 110\u00b0.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume the 5-digit number to be abcde. According to the problem, if we add 1 after the number, it becomes 10 times the original number plus 1. If we add 1 before the number, it becomes the original number plus 1. So, we can write two equations based on this information:\n\n10abcde + 1 = 3 x (100000 + abcde + 1)\n10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e + 1 = abcde + 1\n\nSimplifying the equations, we get:\n\n10abcde + 1 = 300001 + 3abcde\n7abcde = 30000a + 3000b + 200c + 30d + 2e\n\nFrom the second equation, we can see that e must be an even number (otherwise, the right-hand side will not be even). Also, e cannot be 0 (otherwise, the left-hand side will not be a 5-digit number). So, the possible values of e are 2, 4, 6, and 8.\n\nLet's try each of these values and see if we get a valid solution:\n\nFor e = 2, we get:\n\n7abcde = 30000a + 3000b + 200c + 30d + 4\nabcde = (30000a + 3000b + 200c + 30d + 4)/7\n\nThis means that (30000a + 3000b + 200c + 30d + 4) must be divisible by 7. We can try different values of d to see if we get a valid solution. After trying different values, we find that d = 7 gives a valid solution:\n\n30000a + 3000b + 200c + 210 + 4 = 7 x abcde\n30000a + 3000b + 200c = 7 x abcde - 214\n\nThe right-hand side is divisible by 7, so the left-hand side must also be divisible by 7. This means that c = 1 or c = 8. We can try both values and see if we get a valid solution. After trying both values, we find that c = 1 gives a valid solution:\n\n30000a + 3000b + 200 + 214 = 7 x abcde\n30000a + 3000b = 7 x abcde - 414\n\nThe right-hand side is divisible by 3, so the left-hand side must also be divisible by 3. This means that b = 1 or b = 4. We can try both values and see if we get a valid solution. After trying both values, we find that b = 4 gives a valid solution:\n\n30000a + 12000 + 7 = 7 x abcde\n30000a = 7 x abcde - 12005\n\nThe right-hand side is divisible by 5, so the left-hand side must also be divisible by 5. This means that a = 4 or a = 9. We can try both values and see if we get a valid solution. After trying both values, we find that a = 4 gives a valid solution:\n\n30000 x 4 = 7 x 42857 - 12005\n\nSo, the 5-digit number is 42857. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 42857.

However, 4 friends did not turn up, so the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each. This means that the new share per person was (96/x) + 4. The total amount contributed by the remaining friends is still Rs. 96, so we can set up an equation:\n\n(96/x) + 4 = 96/x * (x-4)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n96 + 4x = 96(x-4)/x\n\nMultiplying both sides by x, we get:\n\n96x + 4x^2 = 96(x-4)\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n4x^2 - 384 = 0\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we get:\n\nx^2 - 96 = 0\n\nFactoring, we get:\n\n(x-8)(x+8) = 0\n\nSince the number of friends cannot be negative, the only possible solution is x = 8.

Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it sold 240 of each color. We also know that the store sold all of its white golf balls, which means that it had no white golf balls left at the end of the day. Therefore, the store must have had 240 yellow golf balls left at the end of the day. Since this was half of the total number of golf balls at the beginning of the day, the store must have had 2 * 240 = 480 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that there are 100 students in total at Daifu university. Then, based on the given information, 24 students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. Let's call the number of students who are only members of the swim team as \"x\". Then, the number of students who are members of the swim team (including those who are also members of the chess club) is (24 + x). \n\nWe also know that 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club. This means that 80% of members of the swim team are members of both the swim team and the chess club. We can set up an equation based on this information:\n\n0.8(24 + x) = x\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n19.2 + 0.8x = x\n0.2x = 19.2\nx = 96\n\nTherefore, there are 96 students who are only members of the swim team. The total number of students who are members of the swim team (including those who are also members of the chess club) is (24 + 96) = 120. \n\nFinally, we can calculate the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team:\n\n120/100 * 100% = 120%\n\nHowever, this answer is not one of the answer choices. We made a mistake in our calculation, as the percentage of students who are members of the swim team cannot be greater than 100%. \n\nTo correct our mistake, we need to realize that the 24 students who are members of both the chess club and the swim team are being counted twice in our calculation. Therefore, we need to subtract them once to get the correct number of students who are members of the swim team:\n\n(24 + x) - 24 = x\n\n0.8(24 + x) = x - 24\n\n19.2 + 0.8x = x - 24\n\n0.2x = 43.2\n\nx = 216\n\nTherefore, there are 216 students who are only members of the swim team. The total number of students who are members of the swim team (including those who are also members of the chess club) is (24 + 216) = 240. \n\nFinally, we can calculate the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team:\n\n240/100 * 100% = 240%\n\nAgain, this answer is not one of the answer choices. We made another mistake in our calculation, as we forgot to take into account that some students may be members of both the chess club and the swim team. \n\nTo correct our mistake, we need to use the formula:\n\nTotal = Group 1 + Group 2 - Both + Neither\n\nwhere \"Neither\" represents the number of students who are not members of either group. \n\nIn this case, we know that \"Both\" is 24% of all students, or 0.24(100) = 24 students. We also know that \"Group 2\" (students who are members of the swim team) is equal to \"Both\" plus the number of students who are only members of the swim team, or 24 + x = 24 + 216 = 240. We don't know \"Neither\", but we can solve for it:\n\nTotal = Group 1 + Group 2 - Both + Neither\n100 = Group 1 + 240 - 24 + Neither\nNeither = 100 - Group 1 - 240 + 24\nNeither = -116 + Group 1\n\nWe know that \"Both\" is 24, so \"Group 1\" (students who are members of the chess club) must be:\n\nGroup 1 = Total - Group 2 - Neither + Both\nGroup 1 = 100 - 240 - (-116 + Group 1) + 24\nGroup 1 = 8\n\nTherefore, there are 8 students who are only members of the chess club. The total number of students who are members of the swim team (including those who are also members of the chess club) is (24 + 216) = 240. \n\nFinally, we can calculate the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team:\n\n240/100 * 100% = 240%\n\nAgain, this answer is not one of the answer choices.

The latest time the first train can arrive is 5:12 AM from the harbor line. \n\nSo, the time interval during which the first train can arrive is from 5:00 AM to 5:12 AM. \n\nThe total time interval between 5:00 AM and 5:12 AM is 12 minutes. \n\nTherefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is the ratio of the time interval during which the first train can arrive to the total time interval. \n\nProbability = (time interval during which the first train can arrive) / (total time interval) \n\nProbability = (12 - 2) / 12 = 10 / 12 = 5 / 6 \n\nTherefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is 5/6. \n\nThe closest answer choice is (C) 0.6.

We know that the mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay, so the amount of sand in the mixture is 0.3 * 10 kg = 3 kg, and the amount of clay in the mixture is 0.7 * 10 kg = 7 kg.\n\nNext, we need to remove some of the mixture and replace it with pure sand so that the mixture contains equal quantities of sand and clay. Let's say we remove x kg of the mixture. The amount of sand in the remaining mixture is (3 kg - 0.3x) because we are removing some of the sand along with the mixture. Similarly, the amount of clay in the remaining mixture is (7 kg - 0.7x) because we are removing some of the clay along with the mixture.\n\nNow, we need to add some pure sand to the remaining mixture so that the amount of sand is equal to the amount of clay. Let's say we add y kg of pure sand. The amount of sand in the final mixture is (3 kg - 0.3x + y) and the amount of clay in the final mixture is (7 kg - 0.7x).\n\nSince we want the amount of sand to be equal to the amount of clay, we can set up the following equation:\n\n3 kg - 0.3x + y = 7 kg - 0.7x\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n0.4x + y = 4\n\nWe also know that we are removing x kg of the mixture and adding y kg of pure sand, so the total amount of mixture in the final mixture is (10 kg - x + y).\n\nSince we want to remove and replace the same amount of mixture, we can set up another equation:\n\nx = y\n\nNow we have two equations and two variables.

Since the number of lilies doubles every 2 days, we can use the formula N = N0 * 2^(t/2), where N is the final number of lilies, N0 is the initial number of lilies, and t is the time in days.

So, the length of each picket and the space between it is 1/2 + 6 = 13/2 inches. To find the length of x pickets and (x-1) spaces, we can multiply the length of one picket and space by (x-1) and add the length of one picket. So, the length of the fence in inches is: (13/2) * (x-1) + 1/2 = (13x-12)/2. To convert this to feet, we need to divide by 12. So, the length of the fence in feet is: (13x-12)/24.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The paper is in the form of a square with one side of 20 cm. The area of the square is (20)^2 = 400 sq. cm. Two semicircles are drawn on opposite sides of the square as diameters. The diameter of each semicircle is equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm. The area of each semicircle is (1/2) * \u03c0 * r^2, where r is the radius of the semicircle. The radius of each semicircle is 20/2 = 10 cm. Therefore, the area of each semicircle is (1/2) * \u03c0 * (10)^2 = 50\u03c0/2 = 25\u03c0 sq. cm. The area of both semicircles is 2 * 25\u03c0 = 50\u03c0 sq. cm. When the two semicircles are cut out, the remaining paper is in the form of a rectangle with two semicircles removed from opposite sides. The length of the rectangle is equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm. The width of the rectangle is equal to the diameter of the semicircle, which is 20 cm. Therefore, the area of the remaining paper is 20 * (20 - 20/2) = 20 * 10 = 200 sq. cm. Now, we need to calculate the area of the remaining paper in terms of \u03c0. 200 sq. cm is equal to (200/\u03c0) * \u03c0 sq. cm = 200\u03c0/\u03c0 sq. cm = 200 sq. cm. Therefore, the area of the remaining paper is 200 sq. cm. None of the answer choices match the correct answer of 200 sq. cm. The answer is None of the above.",

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so the rate is (w/25)/(x/60) gallons per minute. Simplifying this expression, we get:\n\n(w/25)/(x/60) = (w/25) * (60/x) = 12w/x gallons per minute\n\nNow, we can find how many minutes it will take y gallons to pass through the drain by dividing y by the rate:\n\ntime = y / rate = y / (12w/x) = (xy) / (12w)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) 5xy/(12w).",

            "Pred_Rationale": "The area of the field can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle, since the cow can graze in a circular area around the tethering point. The radius of the circle is half the length of the rope, which is 14/2 = 7 feet. Therefore, the area of the field is pi * 7^2 = 154 pi square feet (rounded to the nearest whole number). \n\nNext, we need to calculate how many square feet the cow can graze in one day. We are given that the cow can graze 10 sq.ft. per day. \n\nFinally, we can calculate the time it will take for the cow to graze the whole field by dividing the total area of the field by the area the cow can graze in one day.

This gives us:\n\nx = [(n + 2\u221an + 4) * (n + 4 - 2\u221an)] / [(n + 4) * (n + 4 - 2\u221an)]\n\nSimplifying this expression further, we get:\n\nx = [(n^2 + 8n + 16) - 4n\u221an] / [(n^2 + 8n + 16) - 16n - 16\u221an]\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of n to find the range of x. We can start by substituting n = 36, which gives us:\n\nx = [(36^2 + 8*36 + 16) - 4*36*6] / [(36^2 + 8*36 + 16) - 16*36 - 16*6]\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nx = 25\n\nNext, we can substitute n = 72, which gives us:\n\nx = [(72^2 + 8*72 + 16) - 4*72*8] / [(72^2 + 8*72 + 16) - 16*72 - 16*8]\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nx = 64\n\nTherefore, the range of x is 25 < x < 64.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + b), where l is the length and b is the breadth. In this case, we are given that the perimeter is 340 meters. So, 340 = 2(l + b), which gives us l + b = 170. We are also given that we need to garden a 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot. This means that the length and breadth of the rectangular plot will be reduced by 2 meters (1 meter on each side). So, the new length and breadth will be (l - 2) and (b - 2) respectively. The area of the garden will be the difference between the area of the original rectangle and the area of the reduced rectangle. The area of the original rectangle is lb and the area of the reduced rectangle is (l - 2)(b - 2). So, the area of the garden is lb - (l - 2)(b - 2). We need to multiply this area by the rate of 10 per square meter to get the cost of gardening. So, the cost of gardening will be:\n\n10[lb - (l - 2)(b - 2)]\n\n= 10[lb - lb + 2l + 2b - 4]\n\n= 10(2l + 2b - 4)\n\n= 20(l + b - 2)\n\n= 20(170 - 2)\n\n= 20(168)\n\n= 3360\n\nTherefore, the cost of gardening the 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot at the rate of 10 per square meter is Rs. 3360.

Let's label this rectangle as \"Total\". \n\nNext, we know that some files are infected by only a virus, some are infected by only a worm, and some are infected by both. Let's use two overlapping circles to represent this. We can label one circle as \"Virus\" and the other as \"Worm\". \n\nWe know that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. Let's use \"x\" to represent the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. Then, the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5x. We can write this information in the Venn diagram as follows: \n\n- The overlap between the Virus and Worm circles represents the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm, which is x. \n- The part of the Worm circle outside of the overlap represents the number of files infected only by a worm, which is 2.5x. \n- The part of the Virus circle outside of the overlap represents the number of files infected only by a virus. We don't know the exact number of files in this category, but we do know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. This means that the Virus circle must represent 50% of the Total rectangle. \n\nUsing this information, we can set up an equation to solve for x: \n\nTotal = Virus + Worm - (both) \n\n250 = 0.5(250) + Worm - x \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nWorm - x = 125 \n\nWe want to find the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm. This means we need to find the number of files in the Virus circle (since these files were not infected by a worm). We know that the Virus circle represents 50% of the Total rectangle, so we can find the number of files in the Virus circle as follows: \n\nVirus = 0.5(250) - x \n\nVirus = 125 - x \n\nFinally, we can substitute the expression for Worm - x into the expression for Virus to get: \n\nVirus = 125 - (Worm - x) \n\nVirus = 125 - 125 \n\nVirus = 0 \n\nThis means that there were no files that were infected only by a virus. Therefore, all 125 files that were not infected by a worm were also not infected by a virus. \n\nSo, the answer is (E) 125.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's start by finding the number of boys and girls in the group initially. We know that the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, so we can write this as:\n\nnumber of boys / number of girls = 4/3\n\nWe can simplify this by cross-multiplying:\n\nnumber of boys = (4/3) * number of girls\n\nWe also know that initially there were 64 boys and 40 girls in the group, so we can write:\n\n64 = (4/3) * 40\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\nnumber of girls = (3/4) * 64 = 48\n\nSo initially there were 64 boys and 48 girls in the group. Now, the same number of boys and girls have joined the group, so let's say that x boys and x girls have joined. The total number of members in the group now is:\n\n64 + x (boys) + 48 + x (girls) = 112 + 2x\n\nWe also know that the ratio of boys to girls is still 4:3, so we can write:\n\n(64 + x) / (48 + x) = 4/3\n\nCross-multiplying and simplifying, we get:\n\n192 + 3x = 256 + 4x\n\nx = 64\n\nSo 64 boys and 64 girls have joined the group. The total number of members in the group now is:\n\n112 + 2x = 112 + 2(64) = 240\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) 200.",

If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ? Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the amount of zinc and copper in 40 grams of alloy X. The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy X is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. This means that out of every 5 parts of the alloy, 2 parts are zinc and 3 parts are copper. So, in 40 grams of alloy X, there are (2/5)*40 = 16 grams of zinc and (3/5)*40 = 24 grams of copper.\n\nNext, we need to find the amount of zinc and copper in 60 grams of alloy Y. The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Y is 7:11, which does not simplify. So, in 60 grams of alloy Y, there are (7/18)*60 = 23.33 grams of zinc and (11/18)*60 = 36.67 grams of copper (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nNow, we can find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z by adding the amounts from alloy X and alloy Y. The total amount of zinc is 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams, and the total amount of copper is 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams.\n\nFinally, we can express the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z by dividing the total amount of zinc by the total amount of copper and simplifying the ratio. Dividing both sides by 0.67, we get:\n\nzinc:copper = 59:91\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 59:91. The answer is D.",
