If none of the options are correct, generate 'None of the above'. To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\n\nQ: A man can row upstream at 10kmph and downstream at 24 kmph. The speed of the stream is Answer Choices: (A) 2.5 km/hr (B) 4.2 km/hr (C) 7 km/hr (D) 10.5 km/hr (E) None\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Let the speed of the boat be 'b' and the speed of the stream be 's'. When the man rows upstream, his effective speed is (b - s) and when he rows downstream, his effective speed is (b + s). We are given that the man can row upstream at 10 kmph and downstream at 24 kmph. So, we have two equations: b - s = 10 b + s = 24 Adding these equations, we get: 2b = 34 b = 17 Substituting this value of b in either of the equations, we get: s = 24 - 17 = 7 Therefore, the speed of the stream is 7 km/hr. Hence, the correct answer is (C) 7 km/hr. The answer is C.\n\nQ: How many keystrokes are needed to type numbers from 1 to 1000? Answer Choices: (A) 3001 (B) 2893 (C) 2704 (D) 2890 (E) None of these\n\nA: Let's think step by step. To type numbers from 1 to 9, we need 9 keystrokes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). To type numbers from 10 to 99, we need 180 keystrokes (10-19: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19; 20-29: 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29; and so on up to 90-99). To type numbers from 100 to 999, we need 2700 keystrokes (100-199: 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109; 110-119: 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119; and so on up to 990-999). Finally, we need 1 keystroke for the number 1000. Adding these up, we get 9 + 180 + 2700 + 1 = 2890 keystrokes. Therefore, the answer is (D) 2890. The answer is D.\n\nQ: How much time will it take for an amount of Rs. 450 to yield Rs. 81 as interest at 4.5 % per annum of simple interest ? Answer Choices: (A) 3.5 years (B) 4 years (C) 4.5 years (D) 5 years (E) None\n\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that Simple Interest (SI) = (P * R * T) / 100, where P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest and T is the time period. Here, P = Rs. 450, SI = Rs. 81 and R = 4.5% Substituting the values in the formula, we get: 81 = (450 * 4.5 * T) / 100 Simplifying this equation, we get: T = (81 * 100) / (450 * 4.5) T = 4 years Therefore, the answer is (B) 4 years. The answer is B.\n\nQ: If north becomes south-west ant south-west becomes east and all the directions changed in the same manner,then what will be the direction for south-east? Answer Choices: (A) North-West (B) North-East (C) North (D) West (E) none\n\nA: Let's think step by step. If north becomes south-west, then south-west becomes north-east. Similarly, if south-west becomes east, then east becomes south. Therefore, we can conclude that south-east will become west. So, the correct answer is (D) West. The answer is D.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step."

Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. So, the total revenue from the sale of pens is 7200 * 10 = Rs. 72,000. The company estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. Let the cost of manufacturing each pen be Rs. x. Then, the total cost of manufacturing 7200 pens is 7200x. The company makes a profit of 25%, so the total profit is 0.25 * 7200x = 1800x. The company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. So, the company can only sell 90% of the manufactured pens. Therefore, the revenue from the sale of 7200 pens is actually from the sale of 90% of the manufactured pens, which is 0.9 * 7200 = 6480 pens. We can now write the equation: 7200x - 1800x = 6480 * x * 10 Solving for x, we get: 5400x = 64800 x = 12 Therefore, the cost of manufacturing each pen is Rs. 12.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's first calculate the fraction of work done by each person in a day. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so he can paint 1/6 of a house in a day. Similarly, Mr.Black can paint 1/8 of a house in a day and Mr.Blue can paint 1/12 of a house in a day.\n\nNow, let's calculate the work done in the first 8 days. Mr.Brown works for 8 days, so he completes 8 * 1/6 = 4/3 of the work. Mr.Black works for 8 days, so he completes 8 * 1/8 = 1 of the work. Together, they complete 4/3 + 1 = 7/3 of the work in the first 8 days.\n\nAfter 8 days, Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr.Black works for 6 more days.

Answer Choices: (A) 43 seconds (B) 39 seconds (C) 20 seconds (D) 33 seconds (E) 55 seconds",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to convert the speed of the train from miles per hour to miles per second, since we are given the time taken in seconds. 120 miles per hour is equal to 2 miles per minute or 1/30 miles per second. \n\nNext, we need to find the length of the train. We are given that the train takes exactly three seconds to enter the one-mile long tunnel. This means that the front of the train enters the tunnel at time zero and the back of the train enters the tunnel at time three seconds. Therefore, the length of the train is equal to the distance it travels in three seconds at a speed of 1/30 miles per second. \n\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = (1/30) x 3\nDistance = 1/10 mile\n\nSo, the length of the train is 1/10 mile. \n\nFinally, we can find the time taken for the train to completely pass through the tunnel by adding the time taken to enter the tunnel (3 seconds) to the time taken to travel the length of the train at a speed of 1/30 miles per second. \n\nTime = 3 + (Distance/Speed)\nTime = 3 + (1/10)/(1/30)\nTime = 3 + 3\nTime = 6 seconds\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not given in the answer choices.

Let's divide this by the number of tulips in each bouquet (2x) to get the number of bouquets: \n\n126 / 2x = 63 / x \n\nFor the greatest number of identical bouquets, we want x to be as large as possible. The factors of 63 are 1, 3, 7, 9, 21, and 63. We can eliminate 1, 3, and 9 because they do not divide 28 evenly.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the total number of people who took the survey is 'x'. We are given that 60% of the people who took the survey were women. Therefore, the number of women who took the survey is 0.6x. This means that the number of men who took the survey is 0.4x. We are also given that 75% of the men who were surveyed preferred red cars over green cars. Therefore, the number of men who preferred red cars is 0.75 * 0.4x = 0.3x. This means that the number of men who preferred green cars is 0.1x. We can now write an equation based on the total number of people who preferred red cars and green cars: 0.6x + 0.3x = 0.9x people preferred red cars 0.1x people preferred green cars We know that the total number of people who preferred red cars and green cars is equal to the total number of people who took the survey. Therefore, we can write another equation: 0.9x + 0.1x = x Solving this equation, we get: x = 100 Therefore, the total number of people who took the survey is 100.

Similarly, we know that N leaves City B at 7 am and reaches City A at 10:30 am, which means it takes 3.5 hours for N to complete its journey. Therefore, we can write: x + y = 7.5 (since the total journey time of the two trains is 7.5 hours) x = 4 - y (since M has already traveled for 4 hours when the two trains meet) Substituting the value of x in the first equation, we get: 4 - y + y = 7.5 4 = 7.5 - y y = 3.5 Therefore, N has traveled for 3.5 hours when the two trains meet.

To take advantage of the discount, the merchant needs to pay within 30 days. So, he needs to borrow money for 30 days. Let the amount he borrows be P. Then, he needs to pay 96% of the invoice amount, which is $20,000 x 0.96 = $19,200. He will pay back the borrowed amount P plus the interest I. So, we have:\n\nP + I = $19,200\n\nThe interest he pays is given by:\n\nI = P x r x t\n\nwhere r is the interest rate and t is the time period in years. Here, t = 30/365 (assuming a year has 365 days). Substituting this in the above equation, we get:\n\nI = P x r x 30/365\n\nSubstituting this in the first equation, we get:\n\nP + P x r x 30/365 = $19,200\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nP x (1 + r x 30/365) = $19,200\n\nP x (1 + r x 30/365) / P = $19,200 / P\n\n1 + r x 30/365 = $19,200 / P\n\nr = ($19,200 / P - 1) x 365/30\n\nWe want to find the highest interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money. This means we need to find the value of r that makes P as small as possible. The smallest value of P occurs when the interest rate is highest. So, we need to maximize r. Substituting P = $20,000 in the above equation, we get:\n\nr = ($19,200 / $20,000 - 1) x 365/30\n\nr = -0.04 x 365/30\n\nr = -0.4867\n\nThe highest interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 48.67%.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's call the distance traveled by the first car as 'd'. Then, the distance traveled by the second car will be '50 - d' (since they are starting from opposite ends of the highway). We know that time = distance / speed. So, the time taken by the first car to travel 'd' miles is given by: time taken = d / 12 Similarly, the time taken by the second car to travel '50 - d' miles is given by: time taken = (50 - d) / 13 Since they both meet at the same time, we can equate these two expressions for time taken and solve for 'd': d / 12 = (50 - d) / 13 Solving for 'd', we get: d = 600 / 25 = 24 miles Therefore, the first car travels 24 miles and the second car travels 26 miles (50 - 24). The time taken by both cars to travel these distances is: time taken = distance / speed For the first car: time taken = 24 / 12 = 2 hours For the second car: time taken = 26 / 13 = 2 hours Therefore, they will meet 2 hours after they begin.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the 5-digit number is represented by 'abcde', where a, b, c, d, and e are digits. According to the problem, if we add 1 after the number, we get 'abcde1', which is three times as large as the number we get if we add 1 before the number, which is '1abcde'. Mathematically, we can represent this as: 3(abcde + 1) = 1 + 10,000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e 1 + 10,000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e = 3(abcde) + 3 Now, we know that the number is a 5-digit number, so a cannot be 0. Also, we know that the number is three times as large as the number we get if we add 1 before it, so e cannot be 9. Therefore, we can assume that a = 4 (because 3(abcde) + 3 will be a number starting with 1 if a is any other digit), and e = 2 (because 3(abcde) will end with 1 if e is any other digit). Substituting these values in the equation, we get: 1 + 10,000(4) + 1000b + 100c + 10d + 2 = 3(4bcde) + 3 40,003 + 1000b + 100c + 10d = 12,000bcde Dividing both sides by 1000, we get: 40.003 + b + 0.1c + 0.01d = 12bcde Since the left-hand side is not an integer, we can conclude that b = 2 (because 12bcde must be an integer). Substituting this value in the equation, we get: 40.003 + 2 + 0.1c + 0.01d = 240de Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.1c + 0.01d = 198.997 - 240de Since c and d are digits, the left-hand side of the equation must be less than 1. Therefore, we can conclude that d = 7 (because 198.997 - 240de must be less than 1 if d is any other digit). Substituting this value in the equation, we get: 0.1c = 1.97 - 24e Since c is a digit, the left-hand side of the equation must be less than 1. Therefore, we can conclude that e = 5 (because 1.97 - 24e must be less than 1 if e is any other digit). Substituting this value in the equation, we get: 0.1c = -0.03 Solving for c, we get: c = 7 Therefore, the 5-digit number is 42757. Checking, we see that 427571 is three times as large as 142757.

The area of the walls is given by:\n\nArea of walls = (Perimeter of room) x (Height of room)\n\n= (4x + 10y) x 2x\n\n= 8x^2 + 20xy\n\nThe area of the doors and windows is given as 15 sq.m.

So, the length of paper required for the doors and windows is:\n\nLength of paper for doors and windows = (15 / 0.5) = 30 m\n\nThe total length of paper required is the length required for the walls plus the length required for the doors and windows.

Then, we have: xy = 96 When 4 friends did not turn up, the remaining number of friends was (x - 4) and the amount each person had to contribute became (y + 4). We have: (x - 4)(y + 4) = 96 Expanding this equation, we get: xy + 4x - 4y - 16 = 96 Substituting the value of xy from the first equation, we get: 96 + 4x - 4y - 16 = 96 Simplifying this equation, we get: 4x - 4y = 16 x - y = 4 We know that xy = 96. Substituting y = x - 4 in this equation, we get: x(x - 4) = 96 Simplifying this equation, we get: x^2 - 4x - 96 = 0 Factorizing this equation, we get: (x - 12)(x + 8) = 0 Therefore, x = 12 or x = -8.

Then, 20% of them are not members of the chess club, which means 80% of them are members of the chess club. So, the number of students who are members of both the swim team and the chess club is 24% of 100, which is 24. Therefore, we can write the following equation: 80% of x + 24 = x Solving for x, we get: 0.8x + 24 = x 0.2x = 24 x = 120 Therefore, there are 120 students who are members of the swim team.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the length of the rectangular yard be 'l' and the width be 'w'. We are given that the area of the yard is 240 square meters. So, we have lw = 240. We are also given that Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. This means that the perimeter of the three sides that need fencing is (l + w + l - 10) = (2l + w - 10). Therefore, the amount of fencing needed is (2l + w - 10) meters. We need to find the value of (2l + w - 10). From the given information, we can see that we have two variables and one equation. We need another equation to solve for the variables. Let's use the fact that the length and width are positive. This means that l > 0 and w > 0. From the equation lw = 240, we can see that l and w have the same sign. If they were of opposite signs, their product would be negative, which is not possible. Therefore, we can assume that l and w are both positive. Now, we can use the technique of completing the square to find the minimum value of (2l + w - 10). We have: (2l + w - 10) = 2(l - 5) + w = 2(l - 5) + 2.5w - 5 + 5 = 2(l - 5) + 2.5w Now, we want to find the minimum value of (2l + w - 10), which is the same as finding the minimum value of (2(l - 5) + 2.5w). The minimum value of this expression occurs when (l - 5) = 0, which means that l = 5. Substituting this value of l in the equation lw = 240, we get w = 48. Therefore, the amount of fencing needed is (2l + w - 10) = (2(5) + 48 - 10) = 58 meters. Hence, the correct answer is (A) 58. The answer is A.",

We know that the number of lilies doubles every two days, so we need to find out how many times the number of lilies will double from 64 to cover the lake. \n\n64 -> 128 -> 256 -> 512 -> 1024 -> 2048 -> 4096 -> 8192 -> 16384 -> 32768 -> 65536 -> 131072 -> 262144 -> 524288 -> 1048576 -> 2097152 -> 4194304 -> 8388608 -> 16777216 -> 33554432 -> 67108864 -> 134217728 -> 268435456 -> 536870912 -> 1073741824 -> 2147483648 -> 4294967296 -> 8589934592 -> 17179869184 -> 34359738368\n\nWe can see that the number of lilies doubles 30 times to reach 1,073,741,824, which is greater than the number of lilies needed to cover the lake. Therefore, it will take 30 * 2 = 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies if there are initially 64 lilies. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 30.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "The length of each picket is 1/2 inch. The length of space between each pair of pickets is 6 inches.

So, the length of each picket and the space between it is (13/2)/12 = 13/24 feet. The total length of the fence is the length of (x+1) intervals of picket and space. So, the total length of the fence is (x+1) times the length of each interval, which is (x+1) * (13/24) feet. Simplifying this expression, we get: (x+1) * (13/24) = (13x+13)/24 feet.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The paper is in the form of a square with one side as 20 cm. So, the area of the paper is 20 x 20 = 400 sq.cm. Two semi-circles are drawn on opposite sides of the square as diameters. The diameter of each semi-circle is equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm. The area of each semi-circle is (\u03c0r^2)/2, where r is the radius of the semi-circle. Here, r = 20/2 = 10 cm. So, the area of each semi-circle is (\u03c0 x 10^2)/2 = 50\u03c0/2 = 25\u03c0 sq.cm. The area of both the semi-circles is 50\u03c0 sq.cm. When these semi-circles are cut down, the remaining paper will be in the shape of a rectangle with length equal to the diameter of the semi-circle (which is equal to the side of the square) and breadth equal to the radius of the semi-circle (which is 10 cm). So, the area of the remaining paper is 20 x 10 = 200 sq.cm. Now, we need to subtract the area of the semi-circles from the area of the paper to get the area of the remaining paper. Area of the remaining paper = Area of the paper - Area of the semi-circles = 400 - 50\u03c0 = 400 - 50 x 3.14 (taking \u03c0 = 3.14) = 400 - 157 = 243 sq.cm. Therefore, the answer is (E) 8.72.

We are given that J + S + F = 100. \n\nWe are also given that when Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. This means that the age difference between Joe and his sister will remain the same, and the age difference between Joe and his father will also remain the same. \n\nLet's assume that the age difference between Joe and his sister is 'x'. This means that the age difference between Joe and his father is also 'x'. \n\nWhen Joe is as old as his father, his father's age will be F + x and Joe's age will also be F + x. At this time, Joe's sister's age will be S + x. We are given that S + x = 2S, which means that x = S. \n\nNow, we are given that when Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. This means that F + x = 2(S + F - S), which simplifies to F + x = 2F - 2S. Substituting x = S, we get F + S = 2F - 2S, which simplifies to 3S = F. \n\nWe know that J + S + F = 100, and we have found that 3S = F. Substituting F = 3S in J + S + F = 100, we get J + 4S = 100. \n\nWe need to find the value of F, which is 3S. We can substitute F = 3S in any of the equations we have derived. Let's use F + x = 2(S + F - S), which simplifies to F + x = 2F - 2S. Substituting F = 3S, we get 3S + x = 4S, which simplifies to x = S. \n\nNow, we know that J + 4S = 100 and F = 3S. We can substitute F = 3S in J + 4S = 100 to get J + 4S = 100, which simplifies to J = 100 - 4S. Substituting J = 100 - 4S and F = 3S in J + S + F = 100, we get 100 - S = 100, which simplifies to S = 0. \n\nThis means that Joe's sister is currently 0 years old, which is not possible.

Therefore, we can assume that the price of a mango will be 3 times some number, say x. So, the price of a mango will be 3x dollars. We don't know the value of x, but we can use the fact that the price of a mango must be a whole number of dollars. Looking at the answer choices, we see that only (C) 20 dollars is a multiple of 3.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the amount received by each nephew be x. Then, each daughter will receive 4x and each son will receive 5x. So, the total amount received by all the nephews will be 2x, the total amount received by all the daughters will be 4x * 4 = 16x and the total amount received by all the sons will be 5x * 5 = 25x. We are given that the total amount divided is Rs. 8600. So, we have the equation: 2x + 16x + 25x = 8600 Simplifying this equation, we get: 43x = 8600 x = 200 Therefore, each nephew receives Rs. 200, each daughter receives 4x = Rs. 800 and each son receives 5x = Rs. 1000. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) Rs. 800. The answer is E.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, let's find the amount of zinc and copper in 40 grams of alloy X. The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy X is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. So, out of every 5 parts of the alloy, 2 parts are zinc and 3 parts are copper. Therefore, in 40 grams of alloy X, we have (2/5) * 40 = 16 grams of zinc and (3/5) * 40 = 24 grams of copper.\n\nSimilarly, let's find the amount of zinc and copper in 60 grams of alloy Y. The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Y is 7:11, which simplifies to 2:3. So, out of every 5 parts of the alloy, 2 parts are zinc and 3 parts are copper. Therefore, in 60 grams of alloy Y, we have (2/5) * 60 = 24 grams of zinc and (3/5) * 60 = 36 grams of copper.\n\nNow, let's find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z. We have 16 grams of zinc from alloy X and 24 grams of zinc from alloy Y, for a total of 40 grams of zinc. We also have 24 grams of copper from alloy X and 36 grams of copper from alloy Y, for a total of 60 grams of copper.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 40:60, which simplifies to 2:3.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the breadth of the rectangular piece is 'x' meters. Then, we know that the length is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth, which means: length = 4x + 1 meters. We also know that the area of the rectangular piece is 150 sq m, which means: length * breadth = 150. Substituting the value of length from the first equation, we get: (4x + 1) * x = 150 Simplifying this equation, we get: 4x^2 + x - 150 = 0 Solving this quadratic equation, we get: x = 5 or x = -7.5 (we can ignore the negative value) Therefore, the breadth of the rectangular piece is 5 meters and the length is 4*5 + 1 = 21 meters.

Since the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, the volume of silver in the alloy is also V.\nLet the weight of aluminum in the alloy be W. Then, the weight of silver in the alloy is 30 - W (since the total weight of the coin is 30 grams).\nSince silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, we can write:\n(30 - W)/W = 2\nSolving for W, we get W = 10 grams.\nTherefore, the weight of aluminum in the alloy is 10 grams and the weight of silver in the alloy is 20 grams.\nThe volume of aluminum in the coin made of pure aluminum can be calculated as follows: Volume = \u03c0r\u00b2h = \u03c0(15/2)\u00b2(1) = 176.71 mm\u00b3\nSince the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, the volume of the coin made of pure aluminum should also be 353.43 mm\u00b3.\nLet the weight of the coin made of pure aluminum be x grams.
