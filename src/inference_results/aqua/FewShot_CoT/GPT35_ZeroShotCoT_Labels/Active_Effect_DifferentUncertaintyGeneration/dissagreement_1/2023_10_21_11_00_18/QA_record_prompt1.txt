If that interest was approx 6.5 of the bond's selling price approx what was the bond's selling price? Answer Choices: (A) 4615 (B) 5325 (C) 5351 (D) 6000 (E) 6154\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much interest the bond yielded. We know that the face value of the bond is $5000 and the interest rate is 6%, so the interest earned is: $5000 x 0.06 = $300 Next, we need to use the information given in the problem to find the selling price of the bond. We know that the interest earned is approximately 6.5% of the selling price, so we can set up an equation: $300 = x x 0.065 where x is the selling price of the bond. Solving for x, we get: x = $4615.38 Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 4615. The answer is A.\n\nQ: A boy has nine trousers and 12 shirts. In how many different ways can he select a trouser and a shirt? Answer Choices: (A) 186 ways (B) 177 ways (C) 188 ways (D) 108 ways (E) 189 ways\n\nA: Let's think step by step. The boy can select one trouser out of nine in 9 ways. For each of these 9 ways, he can select one shirt out of 12 in 12 ways. Therefore, the total number of ways he can select a trouser and a shirt is 9 x 12 = 108 ways. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 108 ways. The answer is D.\n\nQ: There are 6 people in the elevator. Their average weight is 170 lbs. Another person enters the elevator, and increases the average weight to 151 lbs. What is the weight of the 7th person. Answer Choices: (A) 37 (B) 168 (C) 189 (D) 190 (E) 200\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total weight of the 6 people in the elevator before the 7th person enters. Total weight of 6 people = 6 x 170 = 1020 lbs Step 2: Find the total weight of all 7 people in the elevator after the 7th person enters. Total weight of 7 people = 7 x 151 = 1057 lbs Step 3: Find the weight of the 7th person by subtracting the total weight of the 6 people from the total weight of all 7 people. Weight of the 7th person = Total weight of 7 people - Total weight of 6 people Weight of the 7th person = 1057 - 1020 Weight of the 7th person = 37 lbs Therefore, the answer is (A) 37. The answer is A.\n\nQ: How many seconds will a train 100 meters long take to cross a bridge 150 meters long if the speed of the train is 36 kmph? Answer Choices: (A) 28 sec (B) 23 sec (C) 24 sec (D) 25 sec (E) 26 sec\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the train from kmph to m/s. 36 kmph = 36 * 1000 / 3600 m/s = 10 m/s Next, we need to find the total distance the train will cover while crossing the bridge. Total distance = length of train + length of bridge = 100 + 150 = 250 meters Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed time = 250 / 10 = 25 seconds Therefore, the answer is (D) 25 sec. The answer is D.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step."

Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Step 1: Calculate the number of pens the company needs to manufacture to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler. Since 10% of the pens are defective, the company needs to manufacture more than 7200 pens to account for the defective pens. Let's assume the company needs to manufacture x pens. Then, 90% of x pens will be equal to 7200 pens. Therefore, we can set up an equation: 0.9x = 7200 Solving for x, we get: x = 8000 pens Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling 8000 pens at Rs. 10 each. Total revenue = 8000 x Rs. 10 = Rs. 80,000 Step 3: Calculate the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. Let's assume the cost of manufacturing each pen is Rs. y. Then, the total cost of manufacturing 8000 pens will be 8000 x y. The overall profit can be calculated as: Overall profit = Total revenue - Total cost Total cost = 8000 x y Overall profit = 0.25 x Total revenue Therefore, we can set up an equation: 0.25 x Rs. 80,000 = Rs. 80,000 - 8000y Solving for y, we get: y = Rs. 6 Therefore, the manufactured cost of each pen is Rs. 6.

Then, the area of the square piece of cloth was x^2 square feet. \n\nStep 2: When 4 feet is trimmed from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become (x-4) by x. \n\nStep 3: The rectangular piece is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. \n\nStep 4: The area of a triangle is given by the formula: area = (1/2) x base x height. \n\nStep 5: We know that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet.

Total investment of A and B = (40000 x 12) + (60000 x 10) = 480000 + 600000 = 1080000\n\nStep 2: Let x be the number of months C invested. C invested for (12 - 2) = 10 months with A and B, and x months with A, B, and C.

We can do this by dividing the amount spent on trousers by the cost of each trouser: x = 810 / 70 = 11.57 (rounded to two decimal places) Since we can't buy a fraction of a trouser, we can buy a maximum of 11 trousers. The amount spent on trousers will be 70 x 11 = 770. The amount spent on shirts will be 810 - 770 = 40. The number of shirts bought will be 40 / 30 = 4/3.

Then, the diameter of the sphere is also s, and the radius of the sphere is r = s/2. \n\nThe volume of the cube is V_cube = s^3. \n\nThe volume of the sphere is V_sphere = (4/3)\u03c0r^3 = (4/3)\u03c0(s/2)^3 = (1/6)\u03c0s^3. \n\nTherefore, the ratio of the volumes of the cube to the sphere is: \n\nV_cube : V_sphere = s^3 : (1/6)\u03c0s^3 = 6 : \u03c0 \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) 2:\u03c0.

Train N started 2 hours after Train M. Therefore, the time difference between the two trains is 2 hours. Step 4: Find the relative speed of the two trains. The two trains are moving towards each other, so we need to add their speeds. Let's assume the speed of Train M is x kmph. Then, the speed of Train N is (x + y) kmph, where y is the speed of Train N.

Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can get a 4% discount if he pays within 30 days, or he can pay the full amount within n days and get no discount. \n\nTo take advantage of the discount, the merchant needs to pay within 30 days. The amount he needs to pay is:\n\n$20,000 x (1 - 0.04) = $19,200\n\nIf the merchant borrows money to pay for the boat, he needs to pay back the borrowed amount plus the interest. Let's say he borrows x dollars at an interest rate of r%. Then, the amount he needs to pay back after 30 days is:\n\nx + x*r\n\nThis amount should be less than or equal to $19,200, otherwise, he won't be able to take advantage of the discount. So, we can write:\n\nx + x*r <= $19,200\n\nSimplifying this inequality, we get:\n\nx(1 + r) <= $19,200\n\nNow, let's say the merchant pays back the borrowed amount after n days. The interest he needs to pay is:\n\nx*r*(n/365)\n\nThis interest should be less than or equal to 0.04*x, otherwise, he won't be able to take advantage of the discount. So, we can write:\n\nx*r*(n/365) <= 0.04*x\n\nSimplifying this inequality, we get:\n\nr <= 0.04*(365/n)\n\nNow, we need to find the highest value of r that satisfies both inequalities. Substituting the first inequality into the second one, we get:\n\nx(1 + r)*(n/365) <= 0.04*x\n\nSimplifying this inequality, we get:\n\nr <= (0.04*365/n) - 1\n\nr <= 0.0363n - 1\n\nThe highest value of r occurs when n is the smallest possible value. In this case, n is 31 days (30 days for the discount plus 1 day to pay back the borrowed amount). Substituting n = 31 into the inequality, we get:\n\nr <= 0.0363*31 - 1\n\nr <= 0.1673\n\nTherefore, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 16.73%.

This means that L(x,y) is always an integer. \n\nR(x,y) is the sum of the greatest integer less than or equal to 2x and 2y. This means that R(x,y) is also always an integer. \n\nNow, let's consider the answer choices: \n\n(A) L(x,y) = R(x,y) \n\nIf L(x,y) = R(x,y), then we have: \n\n[x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y] \n\nSince the left-hand side is an integer, the right-hand side must also be an integer. This means that [2x] and [2y] must have the same fractional part as x and y, respectively. However, this is impossible for positive real numbers x and y, since the fractional part of 2x is always greater than or equal to the fractional part of x (similarly for y). Therefore, it is impossible for L(x,y) = R(x,y). \n\n(B) L(x,y) \u2260 R(x,y) \n\nThis is true, since L(x,y) and R(x,y) are always integers, and it is impossible for two different integers to be equal. \n\n(C) L(x,y) < R(x,y) \n\nThis is also impossible, since L(x,y) and R(x,y) are always integers, and it is impossible for an integer to be less than another integer that is greater than or equal to it. \n\n(D) L(x,y) > R(x,y) \n\nThis is possible.

It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is: Answer Choices: (A) 2.6m (B) 3.9m (C) 4m (D) 4.2m (E) 4.4m",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Given, the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. Let the height of the room be 2x and the semi-perimeter be 5x. Then, the length of the room is 10x/(2+5) = 2x. \n\nLet's find the area of the four walls of the room. The area of each wall is the product of the length and the height. So, the total area of the four walls is 4 x 2x x 5x = 40x^2. \n\nLet's find the length of the paper required to cover the four walls. The length of the paper required is the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height of the room. The perimeter of the room is 2 x (length + height) = 2 x (2x + 5x/2) = 9x. So, the length of the paper required is 9x x 2x = 18x^2. \n\nLet's find the cost of the paper required. The cost of the paper required is the product of the length of the paper and the cost per meter. The length of the paper is 18x^2 meters and the cost per meter is Rs. 2. So, the cost of the paper required is Rs. 36x^2. \n\nLet's find the area of the doors and windows. The area of the doors and windows is given as 15 sq.m. \n\nThe total area to be covered by the paper is the area of the four walls minus the area of the doors and windows. So, we have:\n\n40x^2 - 15 = area to be covered\n\nLet's equate this to the cost of the paper required:\n\n40x^2 - 15 = 36x^2\n\n4x^2 = 15\n\nx^2 = 15/4\n\nx = sqrt(15)/2\n\nThe height of the room is 2x = sqrt(15) meters, which is approximately 3.9 meters. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 3.9m.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Step 1: Let's call the hundreds digit of the number \"a\", the tens digit \"b\", and the units digit \"c\". We know that a + b + c = 17 and a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109.\n\nStep 2: We need to find the number itself. Let's call it \"abc\". We know that abc - 495 = cba, where \"cba\" is the number with the digits in reverse order.\n\nStep 3: We can rewrite this equation as abc - cba = 495. We can also rewrite abc as 100a + 10b + c, and cba as 100c + 10b + a. Substituting these values, we get:\n\n(100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 495\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n99a - 99c = 495\n\nDividing both sides by 99, we get:\n\na - c = 5\n\nStep 4: We can use this equation along with the equation a + b + c = 17 to solve for a, b, and c. One possible way to do this is to substitute a = c + 5 into the second equation:\n\n(c + 5) + b + c = 17\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2c + b = 12\n\nStep 5: We can now use the equation a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109 to solve for b.

Therefore, it buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. \n\nThe cost of buying newspapers on Sunday is $4 x 2x = $8x. \n\nThe cost of buying newspapers on the other days of the week is $1 x 5x = $5x. \n\nThe total cost of buying newspapers for a week is $210. Therefore, we can set up an equation: \n\n$8x + $5x = $210 \n\nSimplifying the equation, we get: \n\n$13x = $210 \n\nDividing both sides by 13, we get: \n\nx = 16.15 \n\nSince we can't buy a fraction of a newspaper, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the hotel buys 16 newspapers on each day of the week except Sunday, and buys 2 x 16 = 32 newspapers on Sunday. \n\nTherefore, the hotel buys a total of 5 x 16 + 32 = 112 newspapers per week. \n\nSince the hotel buys 32 newspapers on Sunday, it buys 112 - 32 = 80 newspapers on the other days of the week. \n\nTherefore, the hotel buys 80/5 = 16 newspapers on Monday. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 15.",

Therefore, the new length and width will be:\n\nl + 2 + w + 2 = l + w + 4\n\nl + w = 170 - 4 = 166\n\nNow, we can find the area of the boundary by subtracting the area of the original rectangular plot from the area of the new rectangular plot.

The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5(\u221a3 + 1)  (B) 6(\u221a3 + \u221a2)  (C) 7(\u221a3 \u2013 1)  (D) 8(\u221a3 \u2013 2)  (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the height of the tower be h and the distance of the car from the base of the tower be x. \n\nFrom the given information, we can set up the following equations: \n\ntan 45\u00b0 = h/x \n\ntan 60\u00b0 = h/(x + d) \n\nwhere d is the distance traveled by the car in the additional time we need to find. \n\nSimplifying these equations, we get: \n\nh = x \n\nh = (x + d)\u221a3 \n\nEquating these two expressions for h, we get: \n\nx = (x + d)\u221a3 \n\nSolving for d, we get: \n\nd = x(\u221a3 - 1) \n\nNow, we need to find x. \n\nIn 10 minutes, the angle of elevation changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. \n\nUsing trigonometry, we can find: \n\nh/x = tan 45\u00b0 = 1 \n\nh/(x + d) = tan 60\u00b0 = \u221a3 \n\nSubstituting d = x(\u221a3 - 1), we get: \n\nh/x = 1 \n\nh/(x + x(\u221a3 - 1)) = \u221a3 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nx = h/(\u221a3 + 1) \n\nSubstituting h = x, we get: \n\nx = x/(\u221a3 + 1) \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx = 7h/4 \n\nNow, we can find d: \n\nd = x(\u221a3 - 1) = 7h/4(\u221a3 + 1)(\u221a3 - 1) \n\nSimplifying this expression, we get: \n\nd = h(\u221a3 - 1)/4 \n\nTherefore, the additional time required for the car to reach the base of the tower is: \n\ntime = distance/speed = d/speed = h(\u221a3 - 1)/(4speed) \n\nSince we don't know the speed of the car, we cannot find the exact value of time. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) None of these.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "There are different ways to approach this problem, but one possible method is to look for a pattern in the given prices and use it to estimate the price of a mango. For example, we can notice that the prices of orange and grape add up to the price of pineapple: 18 + 15 = 33 = 27 + 6. This suggests that a mango might cost the same as a pineapple minus the price of an orange or a grape. Therefore, we can try two estimates: mango = pineapple - orange = 27 - 18 = 9 dollars or mango = pineapple - grape = 27 - 15 = 12 dollars. Since neither of these options is among the answer choices, we can conclude that the given information is not sufficient to determine the price of a mango.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's use algebra to solve the problem. Let x be the first of the k consecutive integers. Then, the sum of the k consecutive integers can be expressed as: x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1) = 51 We know that the least integer is -50, so x = -50. Substituting this into the equation above, we get: -50 + (-49) + (-48) + ... + (x+k-1) = 51 Simplifying, we get: -1225 + (k-1)x + k(k-1)/2 = 51 Rearranging, we get: k(k-1)/2 + (k-1)x - 1276 = 0 Now, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for k: k = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a where a = 1/2, b = x-1, and c = -1276. Substituting the values, we get: k = [-x+1 \u00b1 sqrt((x-1)^2 + 2*1276)] / 2*1/2 Since x = -50, we get: k = [51 \u00b1 sqrt(51^2 + 2*1276)] / 1 = [51 \u00b1 sqrt(6561)] / 1 = 51 \u00b1 81 Therefore, k = 132 or k = -30.

We know that: V + W + B = 250 (since there are 250 files in total) W = 2.5B (since the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm) Step 2: We know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. This means that the number of files infected by a virus is 50% of 250, or 125. Therefore, the number of files not infected by a virus is 250 - 125 = 125. Step 3: We need to find the number of files not infected by a worm. To do this, we need to subtract the number of files infected only by a worm (W) and the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm (B) from the total number of files (250). Not infected by a worm = 250 - W - B Not infected by a worm = 250 - 2.5B - B Not infected by a worm = 250 - 3.5B Step 4: We can substitute the value of W from Step 1 into the equation above. Not infected by a worm = 250 - 2.5B - B Not infected by a worm = 250 - 3.5B Not infected by a worm = 250 - 3.5(B) Not infected by a worm = 250 - 3.5(2.5B) (since W = 2.5B) Not infected by a worm = 250 - 8.75B Step 5: We need to find the value of B. To do this, we can use the fact that V + W + B = 250 and W = 2.5B. V + 2.5B + B = 250 V + 3.5B = 250 (combining like terms) We know that the number of files infected by a virus is 125, so V = 125. 125 + 3.5B = 250 (substituting V = 125) 3.5B = 125 (subtracting 125 from both sides) B = 35.71 (dividing both sides by 3.5) Step 6: We can now substitute the value of B into the equation for Not infected by a worm. Not infected by a worm = 250 - 8.75B Not infected by a worm = 250 - 8.75(35.71) Not infected by a worm = 125 Therefore, the answer is (E) 125. The answer is E.",

If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ? Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Step 1: Find the amount of zinc and copper in alloy X. The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy X is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. This means that for every 2 parts of zinc, there are 3 parts of copper. So, out of 6 + 9 = 15 parts, 2/5 are zinc and 3/5 are copper. Therefore, in 40 grams of alloy X, there are: Zinc = 2/5 x 40 = 16 grams Copper = 3/5 x 40 = 24 grams Step 2: Find the amount of zinc and copper in alloy Y. The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Y is 7:11, which simplifies to 1:1.57 (rounded to two decimal places). This means that for every 1 part of zinc, there are 1.57 parts of copper. So, out of 7 + 11 = 18 parts, 1/2.57 are zinc and 1.57/2.57 are copper. Therefore, in 60 grams of alloy Y, there are: Zinc = 1/2.57 x 60 = 23.34 grams (rounded to two decimal places) Copper = 1.57/2.57 x 60 = 36.66 grams (rounded to two decimal places) Step 3: Find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z. Total zinc = 16 + 23.34 = 39.34 grams (rounded to two decimal places) Total copper = 24 + 36.66 = 60.66 grams (rounded to two decimal places) Step 4: Find the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z. Ratio of zinc to copper = 39.34 : 60.66 Simplifying the ratio by dividing both sides by 0.66, we get: Ratio of zinc to copper = 59 : 91 Therefore, the answer is (B) 59:91. The answer is B.",

Then, we can write the length of the rectangular piece as 4x + 1 meters. \n\nStep 2: We know that the area of the rectangular piece is 150 sq m. So, we can write: \n\nx(4x + 1) = 150 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n4x^2 + x - 150 = 0 \n\nStep 3: We can solve this quadratic equation using factoring or the quadratic formula. Factoring gives: \n\n(4x - 15)(x + 10) = 0 \n\nSo, either 4x - 15 = 0 or x + 10 = 0. \n\nIf 4x - 15 = 0, then x = 15/4. \n\nIf x + 10 = 0, then x = -10, which is not a valid solution since the breadth cannot be negative. \n\nTherefore, the breadth of the rectangular piece is 15/4 meters. \n\nStep 4: We can now find the length of the rectangular piece: \n\nLength = 4x + 1 = 4(15/4) + 1 = 16 meters \n\nStep 5: Finally, we can find the perimeter of the rectangular piece: \n\nPerimeter = 2(length + breadth) = 2(16 + 15/4) = 62 meters \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 62 m.
