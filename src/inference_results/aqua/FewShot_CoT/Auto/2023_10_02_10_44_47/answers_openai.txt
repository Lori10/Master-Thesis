        "prompt": "You are an expert at arithmetic reasoning and are willing to solve algebraic word problems. Select the correct answer from the given options. If none of the options are correct, generate 'None of the above'. To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\n\nQ: Which of the following is the lowest positive integer that is divisible by 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11? Answer Choices: (A) 27,720 (B) 29,940 (C) 31,960 (D) 33,970 (E) 35,890\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe number needs to be divisible by 7, 2^3, 3^2, 2*5, and 11.\nThe lowest positive integer is 7 * 2^3 * 3^2 * 5 * 11 = 27,720\nThe answer is A. The answer is A.\n\nQ: A and B start a business, with A investing the total capital of Rs.50000, on the condition that B pays A interest @ 10% per annum on his half of the capital. A is a working partner and receives Rs.1500 per month from the total profit and any profit remaining is equally shared by both of them. At the end of the year, it was found that the income of A is twice that of B. Find the total profit for the year? Answer Choices: (A) 59028 (B) 59010 (C) 59190 (D) 59000 (E) 92700\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nInterest received by A from B = 10% of half of Rs.50000 = 10% * 25000 = 2500.\nAmount received by A per annum for being a working partner = 1500 * 12 = Rs.18000.\nLet 'P' be the part of the remaining profit that A receives as his share. Total income of A = (2500 + 18000 + P)\nTotal income of B = only his share from the remaining profit = 'P', as A and B share the remaining profit equally.\nIncome of A = Twice the income of B\n(2500 + 18000 + P) = 2(P)\nP = 20500\nTotal profit = 2P + 18000\n= 2*20500 + 18000 = 59000\nAnswer:D The answer is D.\n\nQ: Two trains each 250 m in length are running on the same parallel lines in opposite directions with the speed of 80 kmph and 70 kmph respectively. In what time will they cross each other completely? Answer Choices: (A) 19 sec (B) 22 sec (C) 12 sec (D) 42 sec (E) 32 sec\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nExplanation:\nD = 250 m + 250 m = 500 m\nRS = 80 + 70 = 150 * 5/18 = 125/3\nT = 500 * 3/125 = 12 sec\nAnswer: Option C The answer is C.\n\nQ: What are the number of ways to select 3 men and 2 women such that one man and one woman are always selected? Answer Choices: (A) 26 ways (B) 19 ways (C) 30 ways (D) 76 ways (E) 15 ways\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe number of ways to select three men and two women such that one man and one woman are always selected = Number of ways selecting two men and one woman from men and five women\n= \u2074C\u2082 * \u2075C\u2081 = (4 * 3)/(2 * 1) * 5\n= 30 ways.\nAnswer: C The answer is C.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
