If none of the options are correct, generate 'None of the above'. To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\n\nQ: Which of the following is the lowest positive integer that is divisible by 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11? Answer Choices: (A) 27,720 (B) 29,940 (C) 31,960 (D) 33,970 (E) 35,890\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe number needs to be divisible by 7, 2^3, 3^2, 2*5, and 11.\nThe lowest positive integer is 7 * 2^3 * 3^2 * 5 * 11 = 27,720\nThe answer is A. The answer is A.\n\nQ: A and B start a business, with A investing the total capital of Rs.50000, on the condition that B pays A interest @ 10% per annum on his half of the capital. A is a working partner and receives Rs.1500 per month from the total profit and any profit remaining is equally shared by both of them. At the end of the year, it was found that the income of A is twice that of B. Find the total profit for the year? Answer Choices: (A) 59028 (B) 59010 (C) 59190 (D) 59000 (E) 92700\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nInterest received by A from B = 10% of half of Rs.50000 = 10% * 25000 = 2500.\nAmount received by A per annum for being a working partner = 1500 * 12 = Rs.18000.\nLet 'P' be the part of the remaining profit that A receives as his share. Total income of A = (2500 + 18000 + P)\nTotal income of B = only his share from the remaining profit = 'P', as A and B share the remaining profit equally.\nIncome of A = Twice the income of B\n(2500 + 18000 + P) = 2(P)\nP = 20500\nTotal profit = 2P + 18000\n= 2*20500 + 18000 = 59000\nAnswer:D The answer is D.\n\nQ: Two trains each 250 m in length are running on the same parallel lines in opposite directions with the speed of 80 kmph and 70 kmph respectively. In what time will they cross each other completely? Answer Choices: (A) 19 sec (B) 22 sec (C) 12 sec (D) 42 sec (E) 32 sec\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nExplanation:\nD = 250 m + 250 m = 500 m\nRS = 80 + 70 = 150 * 5/18 = 125/3\nT = 500 * 3/125 = 12 sec\nAnswer: Option C The answer is C.\n\nQ: What are the number of ways to select 3 men and 2 women such that one man and one woman are always selected? Answer Choices: (A) 26 ways (B) 19 ways (C) 30 ways (D) 76 ways (E) 15 ways\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe number of ways to select three men and two women such that one man and one woman are always selected = Number of ways selecting two men and one woman from men and five women\n= \u2074C\u2082 * \u2075C\u2081 = (4 * 3)/(2 * 1) * 5\n= 30 ways.\nAnswer: C The answer is C.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step."

If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers? Answer Choices: (A) (zy \u2013 2x) /z (B) (zy \u2013 2) /z (C) (zx \u2013 y) /(z \u2013 2)  (D) (zy \u2013 2x) /(z -2)  (E) (zy \u2013 x) /(z + 2) ",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the highest score be H and the lowest score be L. Then, we know that:\n\n(H + L)/2 = x\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\nH + L = 2x\n\nLet S be the sum of all the scores in the class. Then, we know that:\n\nS/z = y\n\nMultiplying both sides by z, we get:\n\nS = yz\n\nLet T be the sum of all the scores excluding the highest and lowest scorers. Then, we know that:\n\nT = S - H - L\n\nSubstituting the values of S, H, and L, we get:\n\nT = yz - 2x\n\nThe average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is T/(z-2). Substituting the value of T, we get:\n\nAverage score = (yz - 2x)/(z-2)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) (zy \u2013 2x) /(z -2).",

There are 3 PMs, so there are 3! = 6 ways to order them. \n\nThen, we need to choose the order in which the MPs will speak. There are 4 MPs, so there are 4! = 24 ways to order them. \n\nFinally, we need to choose the order in which the MLAs will speak.

            "Pred_Rationale": "If the median income is $3000, it means that there are an equal number of family members earning above and below $3000. Let's assume there are 'n' family members.\n\nIf we arrange the incomes in ascending order, the median income of $3000 will be the income of the (n+1)/2th family member.\n\nSince there are an equal number of family members earning above and below $3000, there will be (n-1)/2 family members earning less than $3000 and (n-1)/2 family members earning more than $3000.\n\nLet the total income of the (n-1)/2 family members earning less than $3000 be x. Similarly, let the total income of the (n-1)/2 family members earning more than $3000 be y.\n\nWe know that x + y + $3000 = $9000 (total income of the family)\n\nSimplifying, we get x + y = $6000\n\nSince there are an equal number of family members earning above and below $3000, the average income of the family members earning less than $3000 will be x/((n-1)/2) and the average income of the family members earning more than $3000 will be y/((n-1)/2).\n\nSince the total income of the family members earning less than $3000 is x and there are (n-1)/2 family members earning less than $3000, the average income of the family members earning less than $3000 will be x/((n-1)/2) = 3000.\n\nSimilarly, the average income of the family members earning more than $3000 will be y/((n-1)/2) = 3000.\n\nMultiplying both sides by ((n-1)/2), we get x = y.\n\nSubstituting this in x + y = $6000, we get 2x = $6000, which gives x = $3000.\n\nThis means that there are (n-1)/2 family members earning less than $3000 and their total income is $3000. Since the average income of these family members is $3000, there must be (n-1)/2 family members earning exactly $3000.\n\nSimilarly, there must be (n-1)/2 family members earning more than $3000 and their total income is $3000.\n\nSince the total income of the family is $9000, we can write:\n\n(n-1)/2 * $3000 + (n-1)/2 * $3000 + (n-1)/2 * $3000 = $9000\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(n-1)/2 = 1\n\nn-1 = 2\n\nn = 3\n\nTherefore, there are 3 family members.\n\nAnswer: B The answer is B.",

Quadrilaterals that do not include the center F of the pentagon.\n\n1. Quadrilaterals that include the center F of the pentagon:\nThere are 5 ways to choose the center point F, and then we need to choose 3 other points from the remaining 4 points A, B, C, D, and E. So, the total number of quadrilaterals that include the center F is 5 * 4 = 20.\n\n2. Quadrilaterals that do not include the center F of the pentagon:\nThere are 5 ways to choose the first point, and then 4 ways to choose the second point, 3 ways to choose the third point, and 2 ways to choose the fourth point. However, we have counted each quadrilateral twice (once in each possible order of choosing the points), so we need to divide by 2. So, the total number of quadrilaterals that do not include the center F is (5 * 4 * 3 * 2) / 2 = 60.\n\nTherefore, the total number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed by joining 4 of the points A, B, C, D, E, and F is 20 + 60 = 80.\n\nAnswer: None of the above.",

If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator? Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the total number of steps in the staircase is 'N'.\nLet the speed of the elevator be 'S' steps/minute.\nAccording to the problem, if you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach the bottom in 10 minutes. This means that the elevator covers (N-20) steps in 10 minutes.\nTherefore, the speed of the elevator is (N-20)/10 steps/minute.\nSimilarly, if you walk 10 steps and stop, then you reach the ground in 20 minutes. This means that the elevator covers (N-10) steps in 20 minutes.\nTherefore, the speed of the elevator is (N-10)/20 steps/minute.\nSince both the above expressions represent the speed of the same elevator, we can equate them.\n(N-20)/10 = (N-10)/20\nSolving this equation, we get N = 60.\nTherefore, the total number of steps in the staircase is 60.\nNow, we can substitute this value of N in any of the above expressions to get the speed of the elevator.\n(N-20)/10 = (60-20)/10 = 4 steps/minute.\nTherefore, the speed of the elevator is 4 steps/minute.\nAnswer: D The answer is D.",
