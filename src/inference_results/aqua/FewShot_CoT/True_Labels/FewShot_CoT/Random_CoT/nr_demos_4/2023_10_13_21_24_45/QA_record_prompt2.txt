Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the total number of children in the row be x. After Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places, she becomes (x-6+2) = (x-4)th from the left end. Similarly, after Neha is shifted to the right by 2 places, she becomes (12+2) = 14th from the left end. \n\nNow, we know that there are 6 children between Radha and Neha. Therefore, the number of children to the right of Neha = (x-1) - 12 = x-13 and the number of children to the left of Radha = 6. \n\nSo, we have (x-4) + 6 + 14 + (x-13) = x\nSimplifying, we get 2x - 3 = x\nTherefore, x = 3\n\nThis is not a valid answer as the number of children in the row cannot be 3.

Then, we have:\n\nDistance covered by Allen in t hours = 54t\nDistance covered by Bob in t hours = 78t\n\nWhen they meet for the first time, the total distance covered by both of them is d:\n\n54t + 78t = d\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n132t = d\n\nNow, let's consider the second meeting. By the time they meet for the second time, Allen would have covered a distance of d (since he has returned to X), while Bob would have covered a distance of d + 48 km. Let the time taken for the second meeting be t2 hours. Then, we have:\n\nDistance covered by Allen in t2 hours = 54t2\nDistance covered by Bob in t2 hours = 78t2 + 48\n\nWhen they meet for the second time, the total distance covered by both of them is again d:\n\n54t2 + 78t2 + 48 = d\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n132t2 = d - 48\n\nSubstituting the value of d from the first equation, we get:\n\n132t2 = 132t - 48\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nt2 = t - 3/11\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the total time taken for both meetings is the same:\n\n2t = t + t2\n\nSubstituting the value of t2, we get:\n\n2t = t + (t - 3/11)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nt = 3/22\n\nSubstituting the value of t in the first equation, we get:\n\n132t = d\n\nSubstituting the value of t, we get:\n\nd = 6\n\nTherefore, the distance between X and Y is 132 * 3/22 = 18 km.\n\nAnswer: None of the above (as none of the answer choices match the correct answer).",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the length of the yard be L and the width be W. We know that LW = 240 (since the area is 240 square meters). We also know that Alice wants to fence three sides of the yard, which means she needs to fence a total distance of L + 2W (since there are two widths and one length). However, we also know that one side of 10 meters will be left unfenced, so the total distance of fencing needed is L + 2W - 10. \n\nWe can use the fact that LW = 240 to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other. For example, we can solve for L by dividing both sides by W: L = 240/W. Substituting this into our expression for the total distance of fencing needed, we get:\n\nL + 2W - 10 = 240/W + 2W - 10\n\nTo minimize the amount of algebra, we can multiply both sides by W to get rid of the fraction:\n\nLW + 2W^2 - 10W = 240 + 2W^2 - 10W\n\nCanceling out the 2W^2 and -10W terms on both sides, we get:\n\nLW = 240\n\nSo we can see that the total distance of fencing needed is just L + 2W - 10. Substituting LW = 240, we get:\n\nL + 2W - 10 = 240/W + 2W - 10\n\nMultiplying both sides by W, we get:\n\nLW + 2W^2 - 10W = 240 + 2W^2 - 10W\n\nCanceling out the 2W^2 and -10W terms on both sides, we get:\n\nLW = 240\n\nSo we can see that the total distance of fencing needed is just L + 2W - 10. Substituting LW = 240, we get:\n\nL + 2W - 10 = 240/W + 2W - 10\n\nMultiplying both sides by W, we get:\n\nLW + 2W^2 - 10W = 240 + 2W^2 - 10W\n\nCanceling out the 2W^2 and -10W terms on both sides, we get:\n\nLW = 240\n\nSo we can see that the total distance of fencing needed is just L + 2W - 10.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the initial mixture contains x kg of sand and y kg of clay. We know that x + y = 10 (since the total weight of the mixture is 10 kg) and that x/y = 3/7 (since the mixture is 30% sand and 70% clay). \n\nWe want to remove some of the mixture and replace it with pure sand so that the final mixture contains equal quantities of sand and clay. Let's say we remove z kg of the mixture. After removing z kg, we have (x-z) kg of sand and y kg of clay. We want to add some amount of pure sand (let's call it w kg) so that we end up with (x-z+w) kg of sand and (y-w) kg of clay. \n\nSince we want the final mixture to contain equal quantities of sand and clay, we have:\n\n(x-z+w)/(y-w) = 1 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n(x+w)/(y-w) = 1+z/w \n\nSubstituting x/y = 3/7 and x+y = 10, we get:\n\n(3/7+w)/(4/7-w) = 1+z/w \n\nCross-multiplying and simplifying, we get:\n\nw^2 - 4zw + 3z^2 = 0 \n\nThis is a quadratic equation in w. Solving for w using the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nw = (4z \u00b1 sqrt(16z^2 - 12z^2))/2 = 2z \u00b1 z*sqrt(2) \n\nSince we want to add pure sand, we must choose the positive root:\n\nw = 2z + z*sqrt(2) \n\nNow we need to find the value of z that minimizes the amount of mixture we need to remove. We want to remove the minimum amount of mixture because the question asks us how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand. \n\nLet's say we remove a fraction f of the mixture. Then we have:\n\nx - fz + w = (3/7)(10 - fz) \n\ny - (1-f)z = (4/7)(10 - fz) \n\nSubstituting w = 2z + z*sqrt(2), we get:\n\nx - fz + 2z + z*sqrt(2) = (3/7)(10 - fz) \n\ny - (1-f)z = (4/7)(10 - fz) \n\nSimplifying and solving for z, we get:\n\nz = (10*sqrt(2) - 20)/(7*sqrt(2) - 6) \u2248 1.183 \n\nTherefore, we need to remove approximately 1.183 kg of the mixture and replace it with approximately 2.366 kg of pure sand. \n\nThe amount of mixture to be removed is approximately 1.183/10 = 0.1183, which is closest to 0.12. \n\nAnswer: None of the above (since none of the answer choices is close to 0.12).",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's first find out how many times the number of water lilies will double starting from 1 until it reaches 64. \n\n2^6 = 64 \n\nSo, it takes 6 doubling periods for the number of water lilies to reach 64. \n\nNow, we need to find out how many more doubling periods are required for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. \n\nLet's say it takes \"x\" doubling periods for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. \n\nSo, \n\n2^(6+x) = total number of water lilies on the lake \n\nAs per the problem, the total number of water lilies on the lake after 60 days is: \n\n2^(60/2) = 2^30 \n\nEquating the above two equations, we get: \n\n2^(6+x) = 2^30 \n\n6+x = 30 \n\nx = 24 \n\nSo, it takes 24 more doubling periods, i.e., 24*2 = 48 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. \n\nAdding the initial 60 days, we get: \n\n60 + 48 = 108 days \n\nAnswer: None of the above.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume the breadth of the rectangular piece to be x. Then, according to the problem, the length of the rectangular piece will be (4x+1). \n\nNow, we know that the area of the rectangular piece is 150 sq m. Therefore, we can write:\n\nx(4x+1) = 150\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n4x^2 + x - 150 = 0\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation to get:\n\nx = 5 or x = -6 (we can ignore the negative value)\n\nTherefore, the breadth of the rectangular piece is 5 m and the length is (4x+1) = 21 m.\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangular piece is given by:\n\n2(length + breadth) = 2(21 + 5) = 52 m\n\nTherefore, the answer is not among the given answer choices.

This means that we are descending 20 steps x 10 minutes = 200 steps in total. \n\nFrom the second statement, we know that if we walk 10 steps and stop, we reach the ground in 20 minutes. This means that we are descending 10 steps x 20 minutes = 200 steps in total. \n\nSince we are descending the same number of steps in both cases, we can set up an equation: \n\n20x = 10(200)\nx = 100/20\nx = 5\n\nTherefore, the speed of the elevator is 5 steps/minute. \n\nAnswer: None of the above (since none of the answer choices match 5 steps/minute).",
