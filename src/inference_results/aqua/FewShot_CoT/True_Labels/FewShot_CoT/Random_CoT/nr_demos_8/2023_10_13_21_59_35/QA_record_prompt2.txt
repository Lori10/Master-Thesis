Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A be E and A respectively. Then, from the given information, we have:\n\n0.09 \u00d7 1 gram = 0.09E (amount of vitamin E in 1 gram of health food)\n0.08 \u00d7 1 gram = 0.08A (amount of vitamin A in 1 gram of health food)\n\nTo obtain at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to solve the following system of inequalities:\n\n0.09E \u2265 E_min\n0.08A \u2265 A_min\n\nwhere E_min and A_min are the minimum daily requirements of vitamin E and vitamin A respectively. Adding these inequalities, we get:\n\n0.09E + 0.08A \u2265 E_min + A_min\n\nSubstituting E_min = 1 and A_min = 1, we get:\n\n0.09E + 0.08A \u2265 2\n\nTo minimize the amount of health food needed, we assume that all the daily requirement of vitamin E is obtained from the health food. Thus, we have:\n\n0.09E = E_min = 1\n\nSolving for E, we get:\n\nE = 1/0.09 = 11.11...\n\nRounding up to the nearest half-gram, we get:\n\nE = 11.5 grams\n\nTo obtain at least the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, we need:\n\n0.08A \u2265 A_min = 1\n\nSolving for A, we get:\n\nA = 1/0.08 = 12.5 grams\n\nTherefore, the minimum amount of health food needed to obtain at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is:\n\n11.5 + 12.5 = 24 grams\n\nAnswer: None of the above (since the closest option is C, but it is not the correct answer)",

Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's say the total work is 1 unit. Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of work is 1/12 units per hour. On a particular day, he finishes two-thirds of the work, which is (2/3) * 1 = 2/3 units. So, the remaining work is (1 - 2/3) = 1/3 units. \n\nJill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, so her rate of work is (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240 units per hour. Let's say Jill takes x hours to finish the remaining work. So, her work done in x hours is (1/240) * x = 1/3 - 2/3 = 1/3 - 4/6 = 2/6 - 4/6 = -2/6 = -1/3 units. \n\nWe have a negative work done by Jill, which means that she is undoing the work done by Jack.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can solve this problem using the formula for compound interest: \n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nwhere A is the amount after t years, P is the principal (starting amount), r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years. \n\nFor simple interest, the formula is:\n\nA = P(1 + rt)\n\nwhere A is the amount after t years, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, and t is the time in years. \n\nLet's use these formulas to solve the problem. \n\nThe difference between simple interest and compound interest for 2 years is Rs. 72. This means that the compound interest is greater than the simple interest by Rs. 72. \n\nLet's assume that the annual interest rate is r. Then, \n\nSimple interest after 2 years = P(1 + rt) = 5000(1 + 2r) \n\nCompound interest after 2 years = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) = 5000(1 + r/100)^2 \n\nThe difference between compound interest and simple interest is: \n\n5000(1 + r/100)^2 - 5000(1 + 2r) = 72 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n(1 + r/100)^2 - (1 + 2r) = 0.0144 \n\nExpanding the left side of the equation, we get: \n\n1 + 2r/100 + r^2/10000 - 1 - 2r = 0.0144 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nr^2/10000 - 2r/100 + 0.0144 = 0 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 10000, we get: \n\nr^2 - 200r + 144 = 0 \n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get: \n\nr = (200 \u00b1 sqrt(200^2 - 4*144))/2 \n\nr = (200 \u00b1 196)/2 \n\nr = 198 or r = 2 \n\nSince the interest rate cannot be negative, the only possible value for r is 2. \n\nTherefore, the rate of interest is 2%. \n\nAnswer: E) 4%",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's solve this question step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of ways to select 3 candy bars from the 11 candy bars. This can be done using the combination formula:\n\nC(11,3) = 11! / (3! * 8!) = 165\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways to select 3 candy bars so that the total cost is more than $4. We can do this by considering the different cases:\n\nCase 1: Select all three candy bars that cost $2 each. There are C(4,3) = 4 ways to do this.\n\nCase 2: Select two candy bars that cost $2 each and one candy bar that costs $1. There are C(4,2) * C(4,1) = 24 ways to do this.\n\nCase 3: Select one candy bar that costs $2, one candy bar that costs $1, and one candy bar that costs $0.50. There are C(4,1) * C(3,1) * C(3,1) = 36 ways to do this.\n\nAdding up the number of ways from each case, we get:\n\n4 + 24 + 36 = 64\n\nTherefore, the answer is 64 out of 165 possible ways:\n\n64 / 165 = 0.39\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, we get:\n\nAnswer: D) 66",

Then, we have:\n\nTotal income of the first n-1 members + $6000 = $9000\n\nTotal income of the first n-1 members = $3000\n\nSince the average income of the first n-1 members is $3000/n, we have:\n\n$3000/n x (n-1) = $3000\n\nn-1 = n\n\nThis is a contradiction, so our assumption that the incomes of the first n-1 members are less than or equal to $3000 is false.

Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the number of newspapers bought on Sunday be x and the number of newspapers bought on each of the other days be y. Then we have:\n\n- x newspapers on Sunday cost 4x dollars.\n- 6y newspapers on the other days cost 6y dollars.\n- The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does on each of the other days, so x = 2y.\n\nThe total cost is $210, so we have:\n\n4x + 6y = 210\n\nSubstituting x = 2y, we get:\n\n4(2y) + 6y = 210\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n14y = 210\n\ny = 15\n\nSo the hotel buys 15 newspapers on each of the other days, and 2y = 30 newspapers on Sunday. Therefore, the hotel buys a total of 6(15) + 30 = 120 newspapers per week, and buys 120 - 2(1) = 118 newspapers on Monday. Answer: None of the above.",

The new average weight of the 10 oarsmen is (x - 53 + w)/10. It is given that this new average weight is increased by 1.8 kg.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Given, M = abc and N = cba. Also, M > N. Therefore, a > c. Now, M - N + 396c = 990. => 100a + 10b + c - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990. => 99a - 99c + 397c = 990. => 99(a - c) = 990 - 397c. => a - c = (990 - 397c)/99. => a - c = 10 - 4c/3. Since a > c, we have 10 - 4c/3 > 0. => 30 - 4c > 0. => c < 30/4. => c < 8. Therefore, c can take values from 1 to 7. For each value of c, we can find the corresponding values of a and b. For example, if c = 1, then a - 1 = (990 - 397)/99 = 6. => a = 7 and b can take values from 0 to 9. Therefore, for c = 1, we have 10 values of M.

Similarly, for c = 5, we have a - 5 = (990 - 1985)/99 = -10. => a = 0 and b can take values from 0 to 9. Therefore, for c = 5, we have 10 values of M.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the total number of steps in the staircase is 'S' and the speed of the elevator is 'E' steps/minute. \n\nFrom the first statement, we can write: \n(S - 20)/E + 10 = t, where 't' is the time taken to reach the bottom when walking 20 steps and stopping. \n\nFrom the second statement, we can write: \n(S - 10)/E + 20 = t, where 't' is the time taken to reach the bottom when walking 10 steps and stopping. \n\nEquating both the expressions of 't', we get: \n(S - 20)/E + 10 = (S - 10)/E + 20 \n\nSolving for 'E', we get: \nE = S/30 \n\nTherefore, the speed of the elevator is 'S/30' steps/minute. \n\nSince we don't know the value of 'S', we cannot determine the exact speed of the elevator. \n\nHence, the answer is None of the above.",

            "Question": "Q: A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The volume of the coin is given by the formula for the volume of a cylinder: V = \u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius (half the diameter) and h is the height (thickness) of the cylinder. Substituting the given values, we get:\n\nV = \u03c0(15/2)^2(2) = 225\u03c0 mm^3\n\nLet x be the volume of aluminum in the coin, so the volume of silver is also x. Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of the silver is twice that of the aluminum. Therefore, the total weight of the coin is:\n\nw = (2x)(2.7 g/cm^3) + x(1.35 g/cm^3) = 5.4x + 1.35x = 6.75x g\n\nwhere we have used the densities of aluminum and silver (2.7 g/cm^3 and 10.5 g/cm^3, respectively).\n\nWe know that the weight of the coin is 30 g, so we can solve for x:\n\n6.75x = 30\nx = 30/6.75 = 4.44 mm^3\n\nThis is the volume of aluminum in the coin. Since the coin is half aluminum and half silver by volume, the total volume of the coin is 2x = 8.88 mm^3. We can use this to find the dimensions of the pure aluminum coin:\n\nV = \u03c0r^2h\n8.88 = \u03c0(15/2)^2h\nh = 8.88/(56.25\u03c0) = 0.05 mm\n\nThe height of the pure aluminum coin is 0.05 mm, and its radius is 15/2 = 7.5 mm. Therefore, its volume is:\n\nV = \u03c0r^2h = \u03c0(7.5)^2(0.05) = 2.95 mm^3\n\nThe density of pure aluminum is 2.7 g/cm^3, so the weight of the pure aluminum coin is:\n\nw = V\u03c1 = 2.95(2.7) = 7.965 g\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 8 grams.
