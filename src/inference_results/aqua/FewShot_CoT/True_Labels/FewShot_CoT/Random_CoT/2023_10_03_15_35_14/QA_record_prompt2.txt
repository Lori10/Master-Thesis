Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the total work is 1 unit. \n\nJack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of work is 1/12 units per hour. \n\nOn a particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, which means he completes (2/3) * 1 = 2/3 units of work. \n\nThe remaining portion of the work is (1 - 2/3) = 1/3 units of work. \n\nJill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, which means her rate of work is (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240 units per hour. \n\nLet's assume that Jill takes x hours to finish the remaining work. \n\nSo, Jill completes (1/240) * x units of work in x hours. \n\nAccording to the given information, Jack and Jill together complete the remaining work, which means: \n\n(1/3) = (1/12) * t + (1/240) * x \n\nwhere t is the time taken by Jack to complete the remaining work. \n\nSimplifying the above equation, we get: \n\n(1/3) = (x + 20t)/240 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 240, we get: \n\n80 = x + 20t \n\nWe know that Jack can complete the remaining work in t hours, so his rate of work is (1/12) units per hour. \n\nTherefore, Jack completes (1/12) * t units of work in t hours. \n\nAdding this to the work done by Jill, we get: \n\n(1/12) * t + (1/240) * x = (1/3) \n\nSubstituting the value of x from the previous equation, we get: \n\n(1/12) * t + (1/240) * (80 - 20t) = (1/3) \n\nSimplifying the above equation, we get: \n\nt = 4 \n\nTherefore, Jack takes 4 hours to complete the remaining work, and Jill takes (80 - 20t) = 60 hours to complete the remaining work. \n\nAnswer: A.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can use the formula for average speed, which is:\n\naverage speed = total distance / total time\n\nSince the plane flies along the four sides of a square, each side has the same length, which we can call \"d\". The total distance traveled is then 4d.\n\nTo find the total time, we need to divide the distance traveled on each side by the corresponding speed, and then add up the times. The time for each side is:\n\ntime = distance / speed\n\nSo the total time is:\n\ntotal time = d/200 + d/400 + d/600 + d/800\n\nWe can simplify this by finding a common denominator:\n\ntotal time = (3d + 1.5d + 2d + 1.5d) / (240000)\n\ntotal time = 8d / (240000)\n\ntotal time = d / 30000\n\nNow we can substitute the expressions for total distance and total time into the formula for average speed:\n\naverage speed = 4d / (d/30000)\n\naverage speed = 120000 / d\n\nWe don't know the value of \"d\", but we do know that it is the same for all four sides of the square. Therefore, we can choose any value we like for \"d\" and the answer will be the same. Let's choose d = 1 km, for simplicity.\n\nThen the average speed is:\n\naverage speed = 120000 / 1\n\naverage speed = 120000 km/hr\n\nThis is not one of the answer choices, but we can round it to the nearest integer to get:\n\nAnswer: A) 384",

            "Pred_Rationale": "We know that the product of two numbers is equal to the product of their LCM and GCD. Let the other number be x. Then we have:\n\n11x = GCD(x, 350)\nLCM(x, 350) = 7700\n\nWe can write 7700 as the product of its prime factors: 7700 = 2^2 * 5^2 * 7 * 11. Since the GCD of x and 350 is 11, we know that 11 is a factor of x. We also know that the LCM of x and 350 is 7700, so x and 350 must have all the prime factors of 7700 between them. Therefore, x must be of the form:\n\nx = 2^a * 5^b * 7^c * 11^d\n\nwhere a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers. We know that 11 is a factor of x, so d must be at least 1. We also know that 11 is a factor of 350, so d cannot be greater than 1. Therefore, d = 1.\n\nNow we can use the fact that 11x = GCD(x, 350) to find the value of x. Since the GCD of x and 350 is 11, we know that x must be of the form:\n\nx = 11k\n\nwhere k is a positive integer. Substituting this into the equation 11x = GCD(x, 350), we get:\n\n11(11k) = 11\nk = 1\n\nTherefore, the other integer is x = 11k = 11(1) = 11.\n\nAnswer: None of the above.",

The amount he needs to pay within 30 days is 96% of $20,000, which is $19,200. \n\nIf he borrows money to pay for the boat, he needs to pay back the borrowed amount plus the interest within 30 days. Let's say he borrows $x at a simple interest rate of r%. Then, the amount he needs to pay back within 30 days is:\n\nx + x*r*t\n\nwhere t is the time in years. Since the time is 30 days, t = 30/365. \n\nHe needs to pay back $19,200, so:\n\nx + x*r*t = 19,200\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx(1 + r*t) = 19,200\n\nx = 19,200/(1 + r*t)\n\nNow, let's say the merchant can afford to pay back the borrowed amount plus the interest at a simple interest rate of i%. Then, the amount he needs to pay back within 100 days is:\n\nx + x*i*(100/365)\n\nHe needs to pay back $20,000, so:\n\nx + x*i*(100/365) = 20,000\n\nSubstituting x = 19,200/(1 + r*t), we get:\n\n19,200/(1 + r*t) + 19,200*i*(100/365)/(1 + i*(100/365)) = 20,000\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nr = (365/30)*((20,000/19,200) - 1)/(100/365 - (20,000/19,200 - 1)*(365/30))\n\nSolving this equation, we get:\n\nr \u2248 247.67%\n\nTherefore, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount is 247.67%. \n\nAnswer: A The answer is A.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's start by breaking down the given information:\n- M = abc is a three-digit number, so a, b, and c are digits.\n- N = cba is the number formed by reversing the digits of M.\n- M > N, so the hundreds digit of M (a) is greater than the hundreds digit of N (c).\n- M - N + 396c = 990 is an equation that relates M, N, and c.\n\nWe want to find how many values of M are more than 300. Since M is a three-digit number, the smallest possible value of M is 100. We can start by listing out the possible values of a, b, and c for M > 300:\n\n- a = 3: b can be any digit from 0 to 9, and c can be any digit from 1 to 2 (since c < a).\n- a = 4: b can be any digit from 0 to 9, and c can be any digit from 1 to 3.\n- a = 5: b can be any digit from 0 to 9, and c can be any digit from 1 to 4.\n- a = 6: b can be any digit from 0 to 9, and c can be any digit from 1 to 5.\n- a = 7: b can be any digit from 0 to 9, and c can be any digit from 1 to 6.\n- a = 8: b can be any digit from 0 to 9, and c can be any digit from 1 to 7.\n- a = 9: b can be any digit from 0 to 9, and c can be any digit from 1 to 8.\n\nFor each combination of a, b, and c, we can calculate the corresponding values of M and N, and check if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. If both conditions are satisfied, we can count that value of M.\n\nThis process can be quite tedious, but we can simplify it by noticing that the value of c only affects the equation M - N + 396c = 990. Specifically, we have:\n\nM - N = 990 - 396c\n\nSince M > N, we know that a > c. Therefore, the largest possible value of M - N occurs when a = 9 and c = 1, which gives:\n\nM - N = 990 - 396 = 594\n\nThis means that for any value of c, we must have M - N \u2265 594. We can use this inequality to eliminate some of the combinations of a and b that we listed earlier. For example, if c = 1, then we must have:\n\nM - N \u2265 594\n900 + 10b - 100a \u2264 594\n10b - 100a \u2264 -306\n\nThis inequality implies that b \u2264 30 + 10a. Since b is a digit, we must have b \u2264 9, which gives:\n\na = 3: b can be any digit from 0 to 3.\na = 4: b can be any digit from 0 to 4.\na = 5: b can be any digit from 0 to 5.\na = 6: b can be any digit from 0 to 6.\na = 7: b can be any digit from 0 to 7.\na = 8: b can be any digit from 0 to 8.\na = 9: b can be any digit from 0 to 9.\n\nWe can repeat this process for each value of c, and count the number of valid values of M. Alternatively, we can notice that the inequality 10b - 100a \u2264 -306 is equivalent to b \u2264 30 + 10a - 31, which gives b \u2264 10a - 1. Therefore, for each value of a, we can count the number of valid values of b, and add them up to get the total number of valid values of M.\n\nUsing this method, we get:\n\n- a = 3: b can be 0, 1, 2, or 3 (4 values).\n- a = 4: b can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 (5 values).\n- a = 5: b can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (6 values).\n- a = 6: b can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 (7 values).\n- a = 7: b can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 (8 values).\n- a = 8:",

            "Question": "Q: A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The volume of the coin is the volume of a cylinder with height 2 mm and radius 7.5 mm (half of the diameter). So, the volume is:\n\nV = \u03c0r^2h = \u03c0(7.5 mm)^2(2 mm) = 281.25 mm^3\n\nLet x be the volume of aluminum in the coin. Then, the volume of silver is also x, since they are equal. The weight of aluminum in the coin is:\n\nw_aluminum = \u03c1_aluminum x\n\nwhere \u03c1_aluminum is the density of aluminum. The weight of silver in the coin is:\n\nw_silver = \u03c1_silver x\n\nwhere \u03c1_silver is the density of silver. We know that the weight of the coin is 30 grams, so:\n\nw_aluminum + w_silver = 30 g\n\nSubstituting the expressions for w_aluminum and w_silver, we get:\n\n\u03c1_aluminum x + \u03c1_silver x = 30 g\n\nSince silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, we have:\n\n\u03c1_silver = 2\u03c1_aluminum\n\nSubstituting this into the previous equation, we get:\n\n\u03c1_aluminum x + 2\u03c1_aluminum x = 30 g\n\n3\u03c1_aluminum x = 30 g\n\nx = 10 mm^3\n\nSo, the volume of aluminum in the coin is 10 mm^3. The volume of the pure aluminum coin is the same as the volume of aluminum in the alloy coin, since they have the same shape. The volume of the pure aluminum coin is:\n\nV_aluminum = \u03c0r^2h = \u03c0(15 mm/2)^2(1 mm) = 176.71 mm^3\n\nThe weight of the pure aluminum coin is:\n\nw_aluminum = \u03c1_aluminum V_aluminum = \u03c1_aluminum (176.71 mm^3)\n\nWe can solve for \u03c1_aluminum using the density of silver:\n\n\u03c1_silver = 2\u03c1_aluminum\n\n10.5 g/cm^3 = 2\u03c1_aluminum\n\n\u03c1_aluminum = 5.25 g/cm^3\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for w_aluminum, we get:\n\nw_aluminum = 5.25 g/cm^3 (176.71 mm^3) = 929.48 mg\n\nConverting to grams, we get:\n\nw_aluminum = 0.92948 g\n\nAnswer: None of the above (the closest option is B, but it is not correct)",

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can use the Pigeonhole Principle to solve this problem. \n\nIf we take out 5 ties, we could potentially have one of each color. However, if we take out one more tie, we will have at least two ties of the same color. \n\nTherefore, we need to take out 6 ties to guarantee that we have at least two ties of the same color. \n\nAnswer: E The answer is E.",
