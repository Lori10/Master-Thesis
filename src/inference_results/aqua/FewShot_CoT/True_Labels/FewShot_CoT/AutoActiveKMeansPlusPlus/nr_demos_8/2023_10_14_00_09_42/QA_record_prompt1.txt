If A and B start working on the project together and A quits 15 days before the project is completed, in how many days total will the project be completed? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 21 (C) 24 (D) 27 (E) 30\n\nA: Let's think step by step. A's rate is 1/20 of the project per day. B's rate is 1/30 of the project per day. The combined rate is 1/12 of the project per day. In the last 15 days, B can do 1/2 of the project. Thus A and B must complete 1/2 of the project, which takes 6 days. The total number of days is 6 + 15 = 21. The answer is B. The answer is B.\n\nQ: A jar full of whisky contains 40% alcohol. A part of this whisky is replaced by another containg 19% alcohol and now the percentage of alcohol was found to be 22%. What quantity of whisky is replaced ? Answer Choices: (A) 1/3 (B) 2/3 (C) 2/5 (D) 3/5 (E) 4/5\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Let us assume the total original amount of whiskey = 10 ml ---> 4 ml alcohol and 6 ml non-alcohol. Let x ml be the amount removed ---> total alcohol left = 4-0.4x New quantity of whiskey added = x ml out of which 0.19 is the alcohol. Thus, the final quantity of alcohol = 4-0.4x+0.19x ----> (4-0.21x)/ 10 = 0.26 ---> x = 20/3 ml. Per the question, you need to find the x ml removed as a ratio of the initial volume ---> (20/3)/10 = 3/5. Hence, D is the correct answer. The answer is D.\n\nQ: Shawn invested one half of his savings in a bond that paid simple interest for 2 years (20% per anum) and received $600 as interest. He invested the remaining in a bond that paid compound interest, interest being compounded annually, for the same 2 years at the same rate of interest and received $655 as interest. What was the value of his total savings before investing in these two bonds? Answer Choices: (A) 3000 (B) 5000 (C) 6000 (D) 8000 (E) 9000\n\nA: Let's think step by step. So, we know that Shawn received 20% of the amount he invested in a year. We also know that in one year Shawn received $300, thud 0.2x = $300 --> x = $1,500. Since, he invested equal sums in his 2 bonds, then his total savings before investing was 2*$1,500 = $3,000. Answer: A The answer is A.\n\nQ: If the range of the set of numbers {150, 90, 125, 110, 170, 155, x, 100, 140} is 90, which of the following could be x? Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 95 (C) 110 (D) 125 (E) 140\n\nA: Let's think step by step. The range of the other 8 numbers is 170-90 = 80, so x must be either the smallest number or the largest number in the set. Then x = 170-90 = 80 or x = 90+90 = 180 The answer is A. The answer is A.\n\nQ: On Wednesday, Kramer purchases exactly 3 new shirts, 2 new sweaters, and 4 new hats, On the following day and each subsequent day thereafter, Kramer wears one of his new shirts together with one of his new sweaters and one of his new hats. Kramer avoids wearing the exact same combination of shirt, sweater, and hat for as long as possible. On which day is this no longer possible? Answer Choices: (A) Tuesday (B) Wednesday (C) Thursday (D) Friday (E) Sunday\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Shirt combinations = 3!/1*(3-1)! = 3*2*1/1*2*1 = 3 Sweater combinations = 2!/1*(2-1)! = 2*1/1*1 = 2 Hat combinations = 4!/1!*(4-1)! = 4*3*2*1/1*3*2*1 = 4 Total Combinations = Shirt Combos*Sweater Combos*Hat Combos 3*2*4=24 combinations 24 / 7 (days of the week) = remainder of 3 Purchased on Wednesday, 3rd day is Saturday. Next day, which he won't have a new combination for, is Sunday. (E) The answer is E.\n\nQ: A farmer is having a total of 20 fruits (apples or oranges). He made two type packets with these fruits. All the fruits are in either apple packets of orange packets. Apple Packets contain 3 apples each and Orange packets contain 2 oranges each.\nIf |apple packets| < 4\nThen How many packets of apples the farmer can have. When number of apple and orange packets are both positive integers above zero. Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 4 (D) 7 (E) 6\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Let us start by understand the meaning of 4 > |Number of Apples| 1) when we write |-x| this means the same as |x|. 2) Mod is very easy concept if you solve mod question by considering as a distance. when a mod is written as |x-(a)| = b, this means the distance from point 'a' (both side left and right of 'a' on number line) is b. |x-(a)| < b means the distance is between the two extreme distance(left and right side of 'a' on number line, considering the max distance is 'b' from 'a' - as per this scenario.....hence the value of 'a' must be between these two extremes. |x-(a)| > b means the distance is greater than the distance of 'b'..i.e the value of a could be anywhere more than 'b'. Now come to the question. Let number of apple packets be \u2018a\u2019 and number of oranges packets be \u2018b\u2019. First its given |a| < 4 ==> |a-0| < 4 ==> the distance from zero is less than 4. So the point \u2018a\u2019 will be -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3 as distance from 0 to these values is less than 4. Number of apple packets is above zero so possible values of \u2018a\u2019 left are 1,2,3. As per the given information there are total of 20 fruits and they are in packets (3 per packet for apples and 2 per packets for oranges) so we can write it as follows: 3a + 2b = 20 ==> b = 10 \u2013 (3*a)/2. If b is an integer then \u2018a\u2019 must be divisible by 2. If we take only those values of \u2018a\u2019 that are divisible by 2 then we are left with 2 only. So there are two packets of apples. If there are two packets of apples then b = 10 \u2013 (3*2)/2 ==> b = 7. So we have 7 packets of oranges and 2 packets of apples. So A is the answer. 7 packets (2 orange each) and 2 packets of apples (3 apples each) make 20 fruits in total. The answer is A.\n\nQ: A thief steals at a car at 4.30 p.m. and drives it at 60 km/hr. The theft is discovered at 3 p.m. and the owner sets off in another car at 75 km/hr. When will he overtake the thief? Answer Choices: (A) 1 p.m (B) 3 p.m (C) 4 p.m (D) 5 p.m (E) 7 p.m\n\nA: Let's think step by step. E 7 p.m Suppose the thief is overtaken x hrs after 4.30 p.m. Then, distance covered by the owner in (x - 1/2) hrs. 60x = 75(x - 1/2) => x = 5/2 hrs.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the total number of microwave ovens sold in 22 months be x. \n\nThen, we know that the average for the first 22 months is: \n\nx/22 \n\nWe also know that the average for the first 10 months is 20. \n\nSo, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months is: \n\n20 * 10 = 200 \n\nWe can use this information to find the total number of microwave ovens sold in the last 12 months: \n\nx - 200 \n\nWe also know that the average for the last 12 months is 42. \n\nSo, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the last 12 months is: \n\n42 * 12 = 504 \n\nNow we can set up an equation: \n\n(x - 200 + 504)/22 = x/22 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nx - 200 + 504 = x \n\n304 = x \n\nSo, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period is: \n\n304/22 = 13.818 \n\nRounding this to the nearest whole number, we get: \n\n14 \n\nTherefore, the answer is none of the above.",

Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. So, the total revenue = 7200 * 10 = Rs. 72,000. The overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. So, the total profit = 25% of the total cost. Let the total cost of manufacturing be x. Then, the total profit = 0.25x. Now, 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. So, the company produces 110% of the required pens. That is, 110% of the delivered pens = 7200. So, the total number of pens produced = (7200 * 100) / 110 = 6545.45 (approx). Out of these, 10% are defective, so the number of good pens produced = 6545.45 * 0.9 = 5890.91 (approx). Now, the cost of manufacturing each pen = total cost / number of good pens produced = x / 5890.91. We know that the total profit = 0.25x. So, the total cost = x = total revenue - total profit = 72,000 - 0.25x. Solving this equation, we get x = Rs. 9600. Therefore, the cost of manufacturing each pen = x / 5890.91 = 9600 / 5890.91 = Rs. 1.63 (approx). Therefore, the answer is None of these.",

Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that Alex and Jacob worked for x hours each. Then, the number of toys Alex made is (x/7) and the number of toys Jacob made is (x/9). We know that the total number of toys made is 35. So, we can write the equation:\n\n(x/7) + (x/9) = 35\n\nMultiplying both sides by 63 (the least common multiple of 7 and 9), we get:\n\n9x + 7x = 2205\n\n16x = 2205\n\nx = 2205/16\n\nx \u2248 137.81\n\nSince both of them worked for almost similar number of hours, we can assume that they worked for 138 hours each. Then, the number of toys Jacob made is:\n\n(x/9) = (138/9) \u2248 15.33\n\nRounding off to the nearest integer, we get:\n\nNumber of toys made by Jacob \u2248 15\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.",

We want to maximize the number of trousers, so we need to find the maximum value of x such that (810 - 70x)/30 is a positive integer. 810 - 70x must be a multiple of 30, so we can write 810 - 70x = 30n, where n is a positive integer. Simplifying this equation, we get: 7x + 3n = 27. The maximum value of x that satisfies this equation is x = 3, which gives us 9 trousers and (810 - 70*3)/30 = 11 shirts.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's solve this problem using the concept of relative speed. \n\nThe total time taken by train M to reach City B is 4 hours. \nThe total time taken by train N to reach City A is 3.5 hours. \n\nLet's assume that the two trains meet at a distance of x km from City A. \n\nThe speed of train M is (x/4) km/hr. \nThe speed of train N is (x/3.5) km/hr. \n\nThe relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds, which is: \n\n(x/4) + (x/3.5) = (17x/140) km/hr \n\nThe time taken by the two trains to meet each other is the same, which we can represent as t hours. \n\nDistance covered by train M in t hours = (x/4) * t km \nDistance covered by train N in t hours = (x/3.5) * t km \n\nSince the two trains meet each other, the sum of the distances covered by the two trains is equal to the total distance between the two cities, which is d km. \n\n(x/4) * t + (x/3.5) * t = d \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nt = (140d/119) hours \n\nWe need to convert this time into hours and minutes. \n\nt = (140d/119) * 60 minutes \nt = (8400d/119) minutes \nt = 70.59d minutes \n\nWe can round off this value to the nearest minute, which is 71 minutes. \n\nTherefore, the two trains cross each other 71 minutes after train N leaves City B, which is at 8:11 am. \n\nAnswer: None of the above.",

However, this includes the 26 cases where both letters are the same, which would not uniquely represent a book. So, the number of unique pairs of letters is 325 - 26 = 299. Since each type of book can be represented by either a single letter or a pair of letters, the smallest number of letters Amy will need is the minimum number of letters required to represent 10 items using 1 or 2 items at a time.

The merchant can afford to borrow money at an interest rate of r or lower. Therefore, we need to find the maximum value of r such that r <= 0.0435n. Since n <= 100, the maximum value of r occurs when n = 100. Thus, r = 0.0435 * 100 = 4.35%. Converting to a simple interest rate, we get 4.35% * (365/30) = 52.67%.

Then, the number of students who attended either the prom night or the debating session or both is:\n\n90 + 70 - x\n\nWe know that this number cannot be greater than 200, since there are only 200 students in the school.

Let's write M and N in terms of their digits: M = 100a + 10b + c N = 100c + 10b + a Since M is greater than N, we have: M - N = 99(a - c) > 0 or a > c. We are also given that: M - N + 396c = 990 Substituting the expressions for M and N, we get: 99(a - c) + 396c = 990 Simplifying, we get: a - c + 4c = 10 or a = 6 - 3c Since M is a three-digit number, we have: 100a + 10b + c > 300 Substituting the expression for a, we get: 600 - 300c + 10b + c > 300 Simplifying, we get: b > (c - 3)/2 Since b is an integer, we have: b \u2265 (c - 2)/2 We also know that a > c, so c can take on the values 1, 2, or 3. For each value of c, we can count the number of possible values of b that satisfy the inequality above. For example, when c = 1, we have: b \u2265 (1 - 2)/2 = -1/2 Since b is an integer, we have: b \u2265 0 So, when c = 1, we have 5 possible values of b: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

We also know that Alice wants to fence three sides of the yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. Since the unfenced side is the width, we have L + 2W = perimeter - 10. The perimeter is the sum of all four sides, which is 2L + 2W. Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2L + 2W = LW/W + 2W + 10, which simplifies to 2L = W^2 + 2W + 10W + 240/W. Multiplying both sides by W, we get 2LW = W^3 + 2W^2 + 10W^2 + 240. Substituting LW = 240, we get 480 = W^3 + 12W^2. We can solve for W using trial and error or a graphing calculator. We find that W = 6 meters. Substituting this value into the equation L + 2W = perimeter - 10, we get L = 14 meters. The total length of fencing needed is 2L + 3W = 2(14) + 3(6) = 44 meters.

            "Pred_Rationale": "This is a classic example of a Fibonacci sequence. Let's denote the number of ways to reach the nth step as F(n). To reach the nth step, we can either take a single step from the (n-1)th step or take two steps from the (n-2)th step. Therefore, the number of ways to reach the nth step is the sum of the number of ways to reach the (n-1)th step and the number of ways to reach the (n-2)th step. This gives us the recurrence relation F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2). We can use this relation to calculate the number of ways to reach the 10th step as follows:\n\nF(1) = 1 (we can only take one step)\nF(2) = 2 (we can take one step twice or two steps once)\nF(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 3\nF(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 5\nF(5) = F(4) + F(3) = 8\nF(6) = F(5) + F(4) = 13\nF(7) = F(6) + F(5) = 21\nF(8) = F(7) + F(6) = 34\nF(9) = F(8) + F(7) = 55\nF(10) = F(9) + F(8) = 89\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.

When it starts raining, the train slows down to 75 miles/hour. The time taken to cover the remaining distance at this speed is (3/4 D) / 75 = (D/100) hours. Therefore, the total journey duration is 10 + 2.5 + (D/100) hours. We need to find the value of D to calculate the total journey duration.

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nLet's denote the number of files infected only by a virus as V, the number of files infected only by a worm as W, and the number of files infected by both as B.\n\nWe know that:\n\n- V + W + B = 250 (since all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both)\n- W = 2.5B (since the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm)\n- V = 0.5(250 - B) (since 50% of the files were not infected by a virus)\n\nWe want to find the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm, which is equal to V (since V represents the number of files infected only by a virus).\n\nSubstituting the second and third equations into the first equation, we get:\n\n0.5(250 - B) + 2.5B + B = 250\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n3B = 125\n\nB = 41.67 (which is not a whole number, but represents the fraction of a file)\n\nSince B represents the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm, it cannot be a fraction. This means that we made a mistake somewhere in our calculations.\n\nLooking at the second equation, we see that W = 2.5B. Since B cannot be a fraction, W must also be a whole number. This means that we need to adjust our value for B so that W is a whole number.\n\nThe closest whole number to 2.5 is 3, so let's assume that W = 3B. Substituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\nV + 3B + B = 250\n\nV + 4B = 250\n\nSubstituting the third equation into this equation, we get:\n\n0.5(250 - B) + 4B = 250\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n3.5B = 125\n\nB = 35.71 (which is still not a whole number)\n\nLet's try assuming that W = 4B (the next closest whole number to 2.5). Substituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\nV + 4B + B = 250\n\nV + 5B = 250\n\nSubstituting the third equation into this equation, we get:\n\n0.5(250 - B) + 5B = 250\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n4.5B = 125\n\nB = 27.78 (which is still not a whole number)\n\nLet's try assuming that W = 5B. Substituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\nV + 5B + B = 250\n\nV + 6B = 250\n\nSubstituting the third equation into this equation, we get:\n\n0.5(250 - B) + 6B = 250\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n5.5B = 125\n\nB = 22.73 (which is still not a whole number)\n\nLet's try assuming that W = 6B. Substituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\nV + 6B + B = 250\n\nV + 7B = 250\n\nSubstituting the third equation into this equation, we get:\n\n0.5(250 - B) + 7B = 250\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n6.5B = 125\n\nB = 19.23 (which is still not a whole number)\n\nLet's try assuming that W = 7B. Substituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\nV + 7B + B = 250\n\nV + 8B = 250\n\nSubstituting the third equation into this equation, we get:\n\n0.5(250 - B) + 8B = 250\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n7.5B = 125\n\nB = 16.67 (which is not a whole number, but is the closest we can get)\n\nSo, we have:\n\n- B = 16 (since we cannot have a fraction of a file)\n- W = 7B = 112\n- V = 0.5(250 - B) = 67\n\nTherefore, the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm is V = 67.\n\nThe answer is (D) 100.",

So, in 40 grams of alloy X, there are:\n\n- Zinc: (2/5) * 40 = 16 grams\n- Copper: (3/5) * 40 = 24 grams\n\nFor alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which does not simplify. So, in 60 grams of alloy Y, there are:\n\n- Zinc: (7/18) * 60 = 23.33 grams (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n- Copper: (11/18) * 60 = 36.67 grams (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n\nNow, we can find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z:\n\n- Zinc: 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n- Copper: 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:\n\n- Zinc: Copper = 39.33:60.67\n- Simplifying this ratio by dividing both sides by 0.67, we get:\n- Zinc: Copper = 59:91\n\nSo, the answer is (D) 59:91.",

            "Question": "Q: A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The volume of the coin is the volume of a cylinder with height 2 mm and radius 7.5 mm. Hence, the volume of aluminum in the coin is (1/2) times the volume of the coin, which is (1/2) x pi x (7.5)^2 x 2 = 88.36 mm^3. Since the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver, the total volume of the coin is 2 x 88.36 = 176.72 mm^3. Let the weight of aluminum in the coin be x grams. Then the weight of silver in the coin is 2x grams. Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of silver is 2 times the weight of aluminum. Hence, the total weight of the coin is x + 2x = 3x grams. We know that the weight of the coin is 30 grams. Hence, 3x = 30, which implies that x = 10. Therefore, the weight of aluminum in the coin is 10 grams. Now, let us consider the second coin. Its volume is the volume of a cylinder with height 1 mm and radius 15/2 mm. Hence, its volume is pi x (15/2)^2 x 1 = 88.36 mm^3. Since the coin is made of pure aluminum, its weight is proportional to its volume. Therefore, the weight of the second coin is (10/88.36) x 88.36 x 2 = 20 grams. The answer is None of the above.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Total number of ways of selecting 2 horses out of 5 horses = 5C2 = 10. The probability of selecting the winning horse is 1/5. Therefore, the probability of not selecting the winning horse is 4/5. The probability of selecting 2 horses and not selecting the winning horse is (4/5)*(3/4) = 3/5. Therefore, the probability of selecting the winning horse is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5. The answer is B.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can use the Pigeonhole Principle to solve this problem. If we take out 5 ties, we could have at most one tie of each color. If we take out one more tie, we will have at least two ties of the same color (either red, violet, or blue). Therefore, we need to take out $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }6}$ ties to guarantee that we have at least two ties of the same color.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "The diameter of the sphere is equal to the space diagonal of the rectangular solid. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the space diagonal of the rectangular solid: \n\nd^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2 \nd^2 = 9 + 16 + 225 \nd^2 = 250 \nd = sqrt(250) \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\nd = 5 * sqrt(10) \n\nTherefore, the diameter of the sphere is 2d: \n\ndiameter = 10 * sqrt(10) \n\nThe answer is approximately 31.546.
