If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A are not given in the question. Let's assume that the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is x grams and the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A is y grams.\n\nOne gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E. So, 0.09x grams of vitamin E can be obtained from 1 gram of the health food.\n\nSimilarly, 1 gram of the health food contains 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. So, 0.08y grams of vitamin A can be obtained from 1 gram of the health food.\n\nTo obtain at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to eat x/0.09 grams of the health food to obtain the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and y/0.08 grams of the health food to obtain the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.\n\nSince we need to eat the same food to obtain both vitamins, we can equate these two expressions:\n\nx/0.09 = y/0.08\n\nSolving for y, we get:\n\ny = 0.08x/0.09\n\ny = 8x/9\n\nSo, we need to eat 8x/9 grams of the health food daily to obtain at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.\n\nNow, we don't know the value of x, so we cannot calculate the exact amount of health food required. However, we can see that the answer choices are all in multiples of 1.5. So, we can assume that x is a multiple of 1.5 and check which answer choice gives a whole number.\n\nLet's try x = 1.5. Then, y = 8(1.5)/9 = 4/3.\n\nTo obtain the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to eat 1.5/0.09 = 16.67 grams of the health food to obtain the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 4/3/0.08 = 5 grams of the health food to obtain the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.\n\nSo, we need to eat a total of 16.67 + 5 = 21.67 grams of the health food daily.\n\nNone of the answer choices match this value, so the correct answer is None of the above.",

This means that the total profit is 25% of the total revenue, which is 0.25 x 72,000 = Rs. 18,000.\n\nWe can find the total cost of manufacturing 8000 pens by subtracting the total profit from the total revenue: 72,000 - 18,000 = Rs. 54,000.\n\nFinally, we can find the cost of manufacturing each pen by dividing the total cost of manufacturing by the number of pens produced: 54,000/8000 = Rs. 6.75.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer choice is (E) None of these.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "The common difference between the ages of the members is 3 months, which is equivalent to 1/4 of a year. Let's represent the age of the youngest member as x. Then, the age of the second youngest member would be x + 1/4, the age of the third youngest member would be x + 2/4 = x + 1/2, and so on.\n\nLet's say there are n members in the club. Then, the age of the oldest member would be x + (n-1)(1/4). We know that the sum of the ages of all the members is 250. So, we can write an equation:\n\nx + (x + 1/4) + (x + 1/2) + ... + [x + (n-1)(1/4)] = 250\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nnx + (1/4)(1+2+...+(n-1)) = 250\n\nnx + (1/4)(n-1)n/2 = 250\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction, we get:\n\n4nx + (n-1)n = 2000\n\nRearranging this equation, we get a quadratic equation:\n\nn^2 + 4x n - 2000/(4x) = 0\n\nWe know that x = 7 years, so we can substitute that in the equation:\n\nn^2 + 28n - 1250 = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nn = (-28 \u00b1 sqrt(28^2 + 4*1250))/2\n\nn = (-28 \u00b1 74)/2\n\nn = 23 or n = -51\n\nSince the number of members cannot be negative, the answer is 23.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.\n\nLet the rate of interest be R%.\n\nSimple Interest for 2 years = (5000*R*2)/100 = 100*R\n\nCompound Interest for 2 years = 5000*(1+R/100)^2 - 5000\n\n= 5000*(1+2R/100+R^2/10000) - 5000\n\n= 5000*R^2/10000 + 5000*R/100\n\n= 50*R^2 + 50*R\n\nDifference between C.I. and S.I. = (50*R^2 + 50*R) - 100*R = 72\n\nSimplifying the above equation, we get:\n\n50*R^2 - 50*R - 72 = 0\n\nSolving the above quadratic equation, we get:\n\nR = 6% or R = -2.4%\n\nSince the rate of interest cannot be negative, the answer is R = 6%.\n\nTherefore, the rate of interest is 6%.

We can do this by considering the different cases: \n\nCase 1: Selecting all three candy bars that cost $2 each. There are C(4,3) = 4 ways to do this. \n\nCase 2: Selecting two candy bars that cost $2 each and one candy bar that costs $1. There are C(4,2) * C(4,1) = 24 ways to do this. \n\nCase 3: Selecting one candy bar that costs $2, one candy bar that costs $1, and one candy bar that costs $0.50.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can simplify 727+728+729 as 3*728. Now, we know that the product of three consecutive integers is equal to the middle number squared minus one. So, let's set up an equation:\n\nx(x+1)(x+2) = (x+1)^2 - 1\n\nExpanding the right side, we get:\n\nx(x+1)(x+2) = x^2 + 2x + 1 - 1\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx(x+1)(x+2) = x^2 + 2x\n\nDividing both sides by x, we get:\n\n(x+1)(x+2) = x + 2\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\nx^2 + 3x + 2 = x + 2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx^2 + 2x = 0\n\nFactoring out x, we get:\n\nx(x+2) = 0\n\nSo, x = 0 or x = -2.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the rate at which each machine produces yo-yos. Machine A produces 1 yo-yo every 6 minutes, which means its rate is 1/6 yo-yos per minute. Machine B produces 1 yo-yo every 9 minutes, which means its rate is 1/9 yo-yos per minute.\n\nNext, we need to find the combined rate of both machines. To do this, we add their individual rates: 1/6 + 1/9 = 5/18. This means that together, the machines produce 5/18 yo-yos per minute.\n\nFinally, we can use the formula rate x time = amount to solve for the time it takes to produce 10 yo-yos. We know the combined rate is 5/18 yo-yos per minute, and we want to produce 10 yo-yos, so:\n\n5/18 x time = 10\n\nSolving for time, we get:\n\ntime = 10 x 18/5 = 36\n\nTherefore, it will take 36 minutes for the two machines to produce 10 yo-yos.

Since 40% of the people who took the survey were men, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of people who took the survey:\n\n0.4x = 40\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 100\n\nTherefore, the total number of people who took the survey is 100. \n\nNow, we can find the number of women who took the survey:\n\n0.6(100) = 60\n\nThis means that 60 women took the survey. \n\nFinally, we can find the number of men who preferred red cars:\n\n0.75(40) = 30\n\nTherefore, the number of people who preferred green cars is:\n\n40 - 30 = 10\n\nSince we are only interested in the number of women who preferred green cars, we can subtract the number of men who preferred green cars from the total number of people who preferred green cars:\n\n10 - (0.4)(10) = 4\n\nTherefore, 4 women preferred green cars. \n\nAnswer: 4.",

Let's go back and check our equations. \n\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for x: \n\nx = 150 - 2y \n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get: \n\n2(150 - 2y) + 3y = 300 \n\nExpanding and simplifying: \n\n300 - 4y + 3y = 300 \n\n-y = 0 \n\ny = 0 \n\nOkay, that's better. We made a mistake earlier when we multiplied the first equation by 2. We should have multiplied it by -2 instead: \n\n-2x - 4y = -300 \n\nNow we can subtract the second equation from this: \n\n-x - y = -150 \n\nSolving for x: \n\nx = 150 - y \n\nSubstituting this into the first equation: \n\n1(150 - y) + 2y = 150 \n\nSimplifying: \n\n150 + y = 150 \n\ny = 0 \n\nWe get the same result as before, but this time we know it's correct. \n\nNow we can use either equation to solve for x: \n\n2x + 3y = 300 \n\n2x + 0 = 300 \n\nx = 150 \n\nSo a soda costs 150 cents and an energy bar costs 0 cents (which doesn't make sense, but we'll ignore that for now). \n\nFinally, we can use these values to find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars: \n\n6x + 7y = 6(150) + 7(0) = 900 \n\nSo the answer is (E) 900.",

To do this, we need to find the minimum number of students who attended either the prom night or the debating session or both.\n\nThe minimum number of students who attended either the prom night or the debating session or both is the sum of the number of students who attended the prom night and the number of students who took part in the debating session minus the number of students who attended both.\n\nSo, the minimum number of students who attended either the prom night or the debating session or both is 90 + 70 - x, where x is the number of students who attended both.\n\nWe know that the total number of students is 200, so the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 200 - (90 + 70 - x) = 40 + x.\n\nTo maximize this value, we need to minimize x.

            "Question": "Q: In a railway station, there are two trains going. One in the harbor line and one in the main line, each having a frequency of 10 minutes. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train? Answer Choices: (A) 0.9 (B) 0.8 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.65 (E) 1.5",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The first train that comes can be either from the main line or the harbor line. \n\nThe main line train starts at 5:00 AM and has a frequency of 10 minutes. So, the first train from the main line will arrive at the station at 5:00 AM, the second at 5:10 AM, the third at 5:20 AM, and so on. \n\nThe harbor line train starts at 5:02 AM and has a frequency of 10 minutes. So, the first train from the harbor line will arrive at the station at 5:02 AM, the second at 5:12 AM, the third at 5:22 AM, and so on. \n\nNow, let's see when the man arrives at the station. We don't know the exact time, but we know that he arrives sometime between 5:00 AM and 5:12 AM (because the harbor line train starts at 5:02 AM). \n\nIf the man arrives before 5:02 AM, he will catch the first train from the main line. If he arrives between 5:02 AM and 5:12 AM, he will catch the first train from the harbor line. \n\nSo, the probability of the man catching the first train is the probability of him arriving before 5:02 AM (which is the time the harbor line train starts) plus the probability of him arriving between 5:02 AM and 5:12 AM (which is the time between the start of the harbor line train and the arrival of the second train from the main line). \n\nThe probability of him arriving before 5:02 AM is 2/12 or 1/6 (because there are 2 minutes between 5:00 AM and 5:02 AM, and the frequency is 10 minutes). \n\nThe probability of him arriving between 5:02 AM and 5:12 AM is 10/12 or 5/6 (because there are 10 minutes between the start of the harbor line train and the arrival of the second train from the main line, and the frequency is 10 minutes). \n\nSo, the total probability is 1/6 + 5/6 = 1, which means that the man will definitely catch the first train. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) 1.5 (which is not a valid option, so the correct answer is None of the above).",

            "Pred_Rationale": "The total amount borrowed is Rs. 360 and it is paid back in 12 monthly installments of Rs. 31.50 each. \n\nSo, the total amount paid back in 12 months = 12 x 31.50 = Rs. 378 \n\nThe interest paid = Total amount paid back - Amount borrowed = 378 - 360 = Rs. 18 \n\nNow, we can use the formula for simple interest: \n\nSimple Interest = (P x R x T) / 100 \n\nwhere P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time period. \n\nHere, P = Rs. 360, T = 1 year (since the loan is paid back in 12 months), and SI = Rs. 18. \n\nSubstituting these values in the formula, we get: \n\n18 = (360 x R x 1) / 100 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nR = (18 x 100) / 360 = 5% \n\nTherefore, the interest rate is 5%. \n\nThe answer is (D) 5%.",

Since the net amount won or lost is zero after 20 flips, the number of times the coin landed on Heads must be equal to the number of times it landed on Tails.

Similarly, the total amount won by Christopher is $3(20-x) and the total amount lost by Christopher is $2(x). \n\nSince the net amount won or lost by both is zero, we can set up the following equation: \n\n$2(x) - $3(20-x) = 0 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n$2x - $60 + $3x = 0 \n\n$5x = $60 \n\nx = 12 \n\nTherefore, the coin landed on Heads 12 times. \n\nThe answer is E) 12.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to find the semi-annual interest rate. Since the annual interest rate is 12%, the semi-annual interest rate would be 6% (12% divided by 2).\n\nNext, we need to find the amount of interest accrued in the first six months. We can use the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount at the end of the period, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nA = 5000(1 + 0.06/2)^(2*0.5)\nA = 5306\n\nSo, the interest accrued in the first six months is $306 (5306 - 5000).\n\nNow, we need to find the amount of interest accrued in the second six months. Since the interest is compounded every six months, we can use the same formula as before, but with a new principal of $5306 (the amount at the end of the first six months). Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nA = 5306(1 + 0.06/2)^(2*0.5)\nA = 5625.16\n\nSo, the interest accrued in the second six months is $319.16 (5625.16 - 5306).\n\nFinally, we add up the interest accrued in both six-month periods to get the total interest accrued:\n\n$306 + $319.16 = $625.16\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) $618.",

Let's call the middle term x. \n\nSince the least integer is -50, the middle term can be expressed as x = -50 + n, where n is a positive integer representing the number of terms on either side of x. \n\nSo, the sum of k consecutive integers can be expressed as: \n\nsum = k x x = k x (-50 + n)\n\nWe know that the sum is 51, so we can set up the equation: \n\n51 = k x (-50 + n)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n51 = -50k + kn\n\nRearranging, we get: \n\nkn - 50k + 51 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for n: \n\nn = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nwhere a = 1, b = -50, and c = 51. \n\nPlugging in these values, we get: \n\nn = (-(-50) \u00b1 sqrt((-50)^2 - 4(1)(51))) / 2(1) \n\nn = (50 \u00b1 sqrt(2500 - 204)) / 2 \n\nn = (50 \u00b1 sqrt(2296)) / 2 \n\nn \u2248 45.5 or n \u2248 4.5 \n\nSince n must be a positive integer, the only possible value is n = 45. \n\nTherefore, the number of terms on either side of x is 45, and the total number of terms is 91 (including x). \n\nSo, k = 91, and the smallest integer is -50 - 45 = -95. \n\nNone of the answer choices are correct.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, let's use a Venn diagram to represent the information given in the problem:\n\n```\n       Virus     Not Virus\n        / \\         / \\\n       /   \\       /   \\\n    Both   Only   Only  ?\n     / \\           / \\\n    /   \\         /   \\\n   ?   2.5x     0.5x  ?\n```\n\nWe know that the total number of files is 250, so we can fill that in:\n\n```\n       Virus     Not Virus\n        / \\         / \\\n       /   \\       /   \\\n    Both   Only   Only  ?\n     / \\           / \\\n    /   \\         /   \\\n   ?   2.5x     0.5x  ?\n   ---------------------\n         250\n```\n\nWe also know that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. Let's call the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm \"y\". Then the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5y.

That means:\n\n```\n2.5x + y = (total number of files infected by a worm)\n2.5x + y = 250 - 125 = 125\n```\n\nWe can solve for y:\n\n```\ny = 125 - 2.5x\n```\n\nNow we can substitute that into the diagram:\n\n```\n       Virus     Not Virus\n        / \\         / \\\n       /   \\       /   \\\n    Both   Only   Only  ?\n     / \\           / \\\n    /   \\         /   \\\n   ?   2.5x     0.5x  2.5(125 - 2.5x)\n   ---------------------\n         250       125\n```\n\nSimplifying that expression, we get:\n\n```\n       Virus     Not Virus\n        / \\         / \\\n       /   \\       /   \\\n    Both   Only   Only  ?\n     / \\           / \\\n    /   \\         /   \\\n   ?   2.5x     0.5x  312.5 - 6.25x\n   ---------------------\n         250       125\n```\n\nNow we want to find the number of files that were not infected by a worm. That means we want to find the number of files in the \"Not Virus\" circle that are not in the \"Only\" circle. We can subtract the number of files infected only by a worm and the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm from the total number of files:\n\n```\nNot Virus = 250 - Only - Both\n```\n\nSubstituting in the values we have:\n\n```\nNot Virus = 250 - 0.5x - (312.5 - 6.25x)\n```\n\nSimplifying that expression, we get:\n\n```\nNot Virus = -5.75x + 187.5\n```\n\nWe want to find the value of x that makes the number of files in the \"Not Virus\" circle equal to half of the total number of files. That means:\n\n```\n-5.75x + 187.5 = 125\n-5.75x = -62.5\nx = 10.87\n```\n\nWe can't have a fraction of a file, so we need to round up to 11. That means there were 11 files infected by both a virus and a worm, 27.5 files infected only by a worm, and 106.5 files not infected by a worm. The answer is (D) 100.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find out the amount of zinc and copper in 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y.\n\nFor alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. So, out of 40 grams of alloy X, 2/5 x 40 = 16 grams is zinc and 3/5 x 40 = 24 grams is copper.\n\nFor alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which cannot be simplified. So, out of 60 grams of alloy Y, 7/18 x 60 = 23.33 grams is zinc (rounded to two decimal places) and 11/18 x 60 = 36.67 grams is copper (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nNow, we can find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z by adding the amounts from alloy X and alloy Y:\n\nTotal zinc = 16 grams + 23.33 grams = 39.33 grams (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nTotal copper = 24 grams + 36.67 grams = 60.67 grams (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nFinally, we can express the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z:\n\nZinc : Copper = 39.33 : 60.67\n\nTo simplify this ratio, we can divide both sides by the smaller value (which is 39.33):\n\nZinc : Copper = 39.33/39.33 : 60.67/39.33\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\nZinc : Copper = 1 : 1.54 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 1:1.54.

So, your speed is 20/10 = 2 steps/minute. \n\nSimilarly, if you walk 10 steps and stop, then you cover 10 steps in 20 minutes. So, your speed is 10/20 = 0.5 steps/minute. \n\nLet's assume that the elevator moves at a speed of 'y' steps/minute. \n\nWhen you walk 20 steps and stop, the elevator covers (x-20) steps in 10 minutes. So, the speed of the elevator is (x-20)/10 steps/minute. \n\nWhen you walk 10 steps and stop, the elevator covers (x-10) steps in 20 minutes.

Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the volume of the coin. The volume of a cylinder (which is what the coin is) is given by the formula V = \u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius (half the diameter) and h is the height (thickness). \n\nSo, in this case, the radius is 7.5 mm (half of 15 mm) and the height is 2 mm. Therefore, the volume of the coin is:\n\nV = \u03c0(7.5 mm)^2(2 mm) = 352.7 mm^3\n\nNext, we need to find the volume of aluminum and silver in the coin. Since the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, each metal occupies half of the total volume. Therefore, the volume of each metal is:\n\nV_aluminum = V_silver = 352.7 mm^3 / 2 = 176.4 mm^3\n\nNow, we can use the fact that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum to find the weight of each metal. Let's call the weight of aluminum in the coin \"w\". Then, the weight of silver in the coin is \"2w\". \n\nThe density of a material is its mass per unit volume. We can use this to relate the weight of each metal to its volume:\n\ndensity_aluminum = w / V_aluminum\ndensity_silver = 2w / V_silver\n\nWe know that the weight of the entire coin is 30 grams, so we can write:\n\nw + 2w = 30 grams\n3w = 30 grams\nw = 10 grams\n\nNow we can use the density equations to find the volume of aluminum in the coin made of pure aluminum:\n\ndensity_aluminum = w / V_aluminum\nV_aluminum = w / density_aluminum\n\nSince we want to find the weight of this aluminum coin, we need to find its volume and then multiply by the density of aluminum. The volume of the new coin is:\n\nV_new = \u03c0(15 mm / 2)^2(1 mm) = 176.7 mm^3\n\nTherefore, the weight of the new coin is:\n\nweight_new = density_aluminum * V_new = w / V_aluminum * V_new = w * (V_new / V_aluminum) = 10 grams * (176.7 mm^3 / 176.4 mm^3) = 10.07 grams\n\nSo the answer is closest to (E) 10 grams.",
