            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nLet's assume that the total work is represented by the variable W.\n\nJack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of work is 1/12 of the total work per hour.\n\nOn a particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, which means he completes (2/3)W work.\n\nThe remaining portion of the work is (1/3)W.\n\nJill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, which means her rate of work is (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240 of the total work per hour.\n\nLet's assume that Jill takes x hours to finish the remaining work.\n\nTherefore, Jill completes (1/240) * x * (1/3)W work.\n\nNow, we can set up an equation to solve for x:\n\n(2/3)W = (1/12) * 8 + (1/240) * x * (1/3)W\n\nThe first term on the right-hand side represents the work done by Jack in 8 hours (since he finishes two-thirds of the work in 8 hours).\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n(2/3)W = (1/6)W + (1/240) * x * (1/3)W\n\nMultiplying both sides by 240, we get:\n\n160W = 40W + x/3\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\nx/3 = 120W\n\nx = 360W\n\nTherefore, Jill takes 360 hours to finish the remaining work.\n\nBut we need to convert this to hours and minutes.\n\n360 hours is equal to 15 days (since there are 24 hours in a day).\n\nSo the final answer is 15 days or 360 hours.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nLet the number of members in the club be n. Then, the ages of the members form an arithmetic progression with common difference 3 months. \n\nThe youngest member is 7 years old, which is 84 months. Let the age of the second youngest member be x months. Then, the age of the third youngest member is (x + 3) months, the age of the fourth youngest member is (x + 6) months, and so on. \n\nThe sum of the ages of all the members is given as 250 years, which is 3000 months. Therefore, we have:\n\n84 + x + (x + 3) + (x + 6) + ... + [x + (n - 2)3] = 3000\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nn/2 [2x + (n - 2)3] = 2916\n\nDividing both sides by n, we get:\n\nx + (n - 2)3/2 = 2916/n\n\nSince x is an integer, 2916/n must be an integer. The factors of 2916 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 19, 27, 36, 38, 54, 57, 76, 81, 114, 152, 171, 228, 342, 456, 513, 684, 1026, 1368, and 2916. \n\nWe can eliminate some of these factors based on the fact that the common difference is 3 months. For example, if n = 4, then the sum of the ages is 84 + x + (x + 3) + (x + 6) = 3x + 93, which is not a multiple of 3. Therefore, n must be a multiple of 3. \n\nAlso, since the youngest member is 7 years old, the age of the oldest member must be less than or equal to 7n years. Therefore, we have:\n\n84 + (n - 1)3 \u2264 7n\n\nSimplifying this inequality, we get:\n\nn \u2265 25\n\nTherefore, the possible values of n are 27, 24, 21, 18, 15, and so on. We can check each of these values by solving for x and verifying that all the ages form an arithmetic progression with common difference 3 months. \n\nFor example, if n = 27, then we have:\n\nn/2 [2x + (n - 2)3] = 2916\n\n27/2 [2x + 24(3)] = 2916\n\n27x + 972 = 2916\n\n27x = 1944\n\nx = 72\n\nTherefore, the ages of the members are:\n\n84, 72, 75, 78, ..., 150\n\nwhich form an arithmetic progression with common difference 3 months.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we can use the formula for batting average:\n\nBatting average = Total runs scored / Number of innings played\n\nWe know that Sachin's current batting average is 51, so we can write:\n\n51 = Total runs scored / Number of innings played\n\nNext, we know that Sachin scored 78 runs in the finals, so we can add that to his total runs scored and add 1 to his number of innings played:\n\nTotal runs scored + 78 = (Number of innings played + 1) * 54\n\nWe can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get:\n\n51 * Number of innings played + 78 = (Number of innings played + 1) * 54\n\nExpanding the right side gives:\n\n51 * Number of innings played + 78 = 54 * Number of innings played + 54\n\nSubtracting 51 * Number of innings played from both sides gives:\n\n78 = 3 * Number of innings played + 54\n\nSubtracting 54 from both sides gives:\n\n24 = 3 * Number of innings played\n\nDividing both sides by 3 gives:\n\nNumber of innings played = 8\n\nSince each match has two innings (one for each team), the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season is:\n\nTotal number of matches = Number of innings played / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4\n\nTherefore, the answer is None of the above, since none of the answer choices is 4.",

We know that the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minute. One revolution is equal to 360 degrees, so the fan rotates 300 * 360 = 108000 degrees per minute.\n\nTo find the angular velocity in radians per second, we need to convert minutes to seconds and degrees to radians:\n\nAngular velocity = (108000 degrees/minute) * (1 radian/57.3 degrees) * (1/60 minutes/second) = 100 radians/second (approx.)\n\nNext, we need to find the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade in 30 seconds. We can use the formula:\n\nDistance = radius * angle\n\nwhere radius is 10 cm and angle is the product of angular velocity and time:\n\nAngle = angular velocity * time = 100 radians/second * 30 seconds = 3000 radians\n\nTherefore, the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade is:\n\nDistance = 10 cm * 3000 radians = 30000 cm = 300 meters\n\nHowever, the answer choices are in terms of pi, so we need to express the answer in terms of pi:\n\nDistance = 30000 cm = 30000/100 meters = 300 meters = 300 * pi/100 pi meters = 3pi meters\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 3000pi centimeters.",

If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we know that 300 deer were tagged in 2001. In 2002, 20 of the 500 deer caught had tags from the previous year. This means that the percentage of tagged deer in the 500 deer sample is (20/500) * 100 = 4%.\n\nWe can assume that this percentage is representative of the entire deer population in the forest. Let the total deer population be x. Then, the number of tagged deer in the 500 deer sample is 0.04x.\n\nWe also know that 300 deer were tagged in 2001. Therefore, the number of tagged deer that were not caught in the 500 deer sample is 300 - 20 = 280.\n\nThe total number of tagged deer in the forest is the sum of tagged deer in the 500 deer sample and tagged deer not caught in the sample. Therefore, we have:\n\n0.04x + 280 = total tagged deer\n\nWe know that the total number of deer in the forest is x. Therefore, we have:\n\n(total tagged deer) / x = percentage of tagged deer in the forest\n\nWe can substitute the expression for total tagged deer into this equation and solve for x:\n\n(0.04x + 280) / x = percentage of tagged deer in the forest\n\n0.04x + 280 = (percentage of tagged deer in the forest) * x\n\n0.04x = (percentage of tagged deer in the forest) * x - 280\n\n0.04x = (percentage of tagged deer in the forest - 0.28) * x\n\nx = (0.28 / 0.04) * 5000\n\nx = 196 * 5000\n\nx = 980000\n\nTherefore, the total deer population in the forest is 980000.

If we rent y DVDs with a membership, the cost would be 7 dollars for the membership plus 2y dollars for the DVDs.\n\nWe want to find the minimum number of DVDs we need to rent to make the membership worth it. In other words, we want to find the value of y where the cost of renting with a membership is less than or equal to the cost of renting without a membership.\n\nSo, we can set up the inequality:\n\n7 + 2y \u2264 4x\n\nSimplifying this inequality, we get:\n\n2y \u2264 4x - 7\n\ny \u2264 2x - 3.5\n\nThis inequality tells us that the value of y must be less than or equal to 2x - 3.5 in order for the membership to be worth it.\n\nNow, we can try different values of x and see what the corresponding value of y is. For example, if we rent 2 DVDs without a membership, the cost would be 8 dollars. If we rent 1 DVD with a membership, the cost would be 7 dollars.

Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, let's find the distance between X and Y. Let's call it d.\n\nWhen Allen and Bob meet for the first time, they have covered a total distance of d. Let's call the distance covered by Allen until then as x. So, the distance covered by Bob until then is (d-x).\n\nNow, let's find the time taken by Allen and Bob to meet for the first time. We can use the formula: time = distance/speed.\n\nTime taken by Allen = x/54\nTime taken by Bob = (d-x)/78\n\nSince they both started at the same time, their time taken to meet for the first time is the same. So, we can equate the above two equations and solve for x.\n\nx/54 = (d-x)/78\n78x = 54(d-x)\n78x = 54d - 54x\n132x = 54d\nx = 54d/132\n\nNow, let's find the distance covered by Bob until they meet for the second time. At the first meeting point, Allen has covered x distance and Bob has covered (d-x) distance. So, the distance between them is (d-x)-x = d-2x.\n\nWhen they meet for the second time, Allen has covered a total distance of 2x and Bob has covered a total distance of (d-2x)+48 (since Bob covers 48 km more than Allen).\n\nLet's find the time taken by Allen and Bob to meet for the second time.\n\nTime taken by Allen = (2x)/54\nTime taken by Bob = (d-2x+48)/78\n\nSince they both started at the same time, their time taken to meet for the second time is the same. So, we can equate the above two equations and solve for d.\n\n(2x)/54 = (d-2x+48)/78\n156x = 54(d-2x+48)\n156x = 54d - 108x + 2592\n264x = 54d + 2592\nx = (54d + 2592)/264\n\nNow, we can equate the above two expressions for x and solve for d.\n\n54d/132 = (54d + 2592)/264\n264*54d = 132*(54d + 2592)\n264*54d = 7128 + 132*54d\n132*54d = 7128\nd = 432/11\n\nTherefore, the distance between X and Y is approximately 39.27 km.

Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's break down the problem. \n\nThe terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can get a 4% discount if they pay within 30 days, or they can pay the full amount within n days and get no discount. \n\nSo, if the merchant pays within 30 days, they only have to pay 96% of the invoice amount, which is:\n\n0.96 x $20,000 = $19,200\n\nThis means that the merchant can borrow up to $19,200 and still be able to pay the invoice within 30 days and take advantage of the discount. \n\nNow, we need to find the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow $19,200. Let's say the merchant borrows the money for x days at an interest rate of r%. Then, the amount the merchant will have to pay back after x days is:\n\n$19,200 + ($19,200 x r x x)/36500\n\nThe denominator 36500 is used to convert the interest rate from an annual rate to a daily rate. \n\nIf the merchant pays back the borrowed amount after n days, then they will have to pay the full amount of $20,000. \n\nSo, we can set up the following inequality:\n\n$19,200 + ($19,200 x r x x)/36500 \u2264 $20,000\n\nSimplifying this inequality, we get:\n\nr \u2264 (36500/19,200) x (20000-19200)/x\n\nr \u2264 365/16\n\nr \u2264 22.81\n\nTherefore, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 22.81%. \n\nThe closest answer choice is (B) 237.67, but none of the answer choices match the calculated value.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we know that B bisects minor arc AC, which means that the measure of minor arc AB is equal to the measure of minor arc BC. Let's call this measure x.\n\nSince minor arc AC has a measure of 160\u00b0, we know that minor arc AB + minor arc BC = 160\u00b0. Substituting x for both minor arc AB and minor arc BC, we get:\n\nx + x = 160\u00b0\n2x = 160\u00b0\nx = 80\u00b0\n\nSo, minor arc AB and minor arc BC both have a measure of 80\u00b0.\n\nNow, we know that minor arc BD has a measure of 150\u00b0. Since minor arc AB and minor arc BC both have a measure of 80\u00b0, we can find the measure of minor arc AD by subtracting the sum of these measures from the measure of minor arc BD:\n\nminor arc AD = minor arc AB + minor arc BC + minor arc CD\nminor arc AD = 80\u00b0 + 80\u00b0 + minor arc CD\nminor arc AD = 160\u00b0 + minor arc CD\n\nminor arc BD = minor arc AB + minor arc BC + minor arc CD\n150\u00b0 = 80\u00b0 + 80\u00b0 + minor arc CD\nminor arc CD = 150\u00b0 - 160\u00b0\nminor arc CD = -10\u00b0\n\nThis doesn't make sense, since an arc can't have a negative measure. Therefore, there must be an error in our calculations.\n\nLooking back, we made the assumption that minor arc AB and minor arc BC both have a measure of 80\u00b0. However, we don't actually know this for sure. We only know that their measures are equal, but we don't know what that measure is.\n\nLet's call the measure of minor arc AB and minor arc BC y. Then, we have:\n\n2y + minor arc CD = 150\u00b0\n2y + minor arc CD = 160\u00b0 - minor arc AD\n\nWe also know that minor arc AB + minor arc BC = 160\u00b0, so:\n\n2y = 160\u00b0 - minor arc AD\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n160\u00b0 - minor arc AD + minor arc CD = 150\u00b0\nminor arc CD = 150\u00b0 - 160\u00b0 + minor arc AD\nminor arc CD = -10\u00b0 + minor arc AD\n\nAgain, we have a negative measure, which means there must be an error in our calculations.\n\nLooking back, we made another assumption that may not be true. We assumed that minor arc AB and minor arc BC are adjacent arcs, but we don't actually know this for sure. It's possible that there is another arc between them.\n\nLet's call the measure of this unknown arc z. Then, we have:\n\nminor arc AB + z + minor arc BC = 160\u00b0\n\nWe also know that minor arc AB = minor arc BC = y, so:\n\n2y + z = 160\u00b0\n\nNow, we can use this equation to solve for y:\n\ny = (160\u00b0 - z)/2\n\nWe also know that minor arc BD = minor arc AB + z + minor arc CD, so:\n\n150\u00b0 = 2y + z + minor arc CD\n150\u00b0 = 2(160\u00b0 - z)/2 + z + minor arc CD\n150\u00b0 = 80\u00b0 + z/2 + minor arc CD\n\nFinally, we know that B bisects minor arc AC, which means that minor arc AB + minor arc BC + minor arc CD = 360\u00b0/2 = 180\u00b0. Substituting in the values we've found, we get:\n\ny + y + minor arc CD = 180\u00b0\n2y + minor arc CD = 180\u00b0\n2[(160\u00b0 - z)/2] + minor arc CD = 180\u00b0\n160\u00b0 - z + minor arc CD = 180\u00b0\nminor arc CD = 20\u00b0 + z\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n150\u00b0 = 80\u00b0 + z/2 + minor arc CD\nminor arc CD = 20\u00b0 + z\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first, we get:\n\n150\u00b0 = 80\u00b0 + z/2 + 20\u00b0 + z\n50\u00b0 = 1.5z\nz = 100/3\n\nNow we can find y:\n\ny = (160\u00b0 - z)/2\ny = (160\u00b0 - 100/3)/2\ny = 230/3\n\nFinally, we can find minor arc AD:\n\nminor arc AD = minor arc AB + minor arc BC + minor arc CD\nminor arc AD = 2y + minor arc CD\nminor arc AD = 2(230/3) + 20\u00b0 + 100/3\nminor arc AD = 460/3 + 20\u00b0 + 100/3\nminor arc AD = 580/3\nminor arc AD \u2248 193.33\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the",

It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is: Answer Choices: (A) 2.6m (B) 3.9m (C) 4m (D) 4.2m (E) 4.4m",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the height of the room be 2x and the semi-perimeter be 5y. Then we have:\n\n2x/5y = 2/5\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n4y = 5x\n\ny = (5/4)x\n\nNow, let's find the area of the four walls of the room. The length of each wall is the height of the room, which is 2x. The total length of the four walls is the perimeter of the room, which is 2 times the semi-perimeter, or 10y. Therefore, the area of the four walls is:\n\n2x * 10y = 20xy\n\nWe are given that it costs Rs.260 to paper the walls with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter. This means that the cost of papering one square meter of wall is:\n\n(2/0.5) = Rs.4\n\nTherefore, the area of the four walls that can be papered with Rs.260 is:\n\n260/4 = 65 sq.m\n\nHowever, we need to subtract the area of the doors and windows, which is given as 15 sq.m. Therefore, the area of the four walls that need to be papered is:\n\n65 - 15 = 50 sq.m\n\nWe know that the area of each wall is 2x times the length of the wall. Therefore, the area of the four walls is:\n\n2(2x)(5y) = 20xy\n\nWe are given that this area is 50 sq.m. Therefore, we have:\n\n20xy = 50\n\nSubstituting y = (5/4)x, we get:\n\n20x(5/4)x = 50\n\n25x^2 = 50\n\nx^2 = 2\n\nx = sqrt(2)\n\nTherefore, the height of the room is:\n\n2x = 2sqrt(2) \u2248 2.83m\n\nThe closest answer choice is B, 3.9m.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nLet's assume that both trains leave the station at time 0. \n\nTrain A leaves every 16 minutes, so it will leave the station again at times 16, 32, 48, 64, and so on. \n\nTrain B leaves every 17 minutes, so it will leave the station again at times 17, 34, 51, 68, and so on. \n\nTo find the next time both trains leave the station simultaneously, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17. \n\nThe multiples of 16 are: 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, 160, 176, 192, 208, 224, 240, 256, 272, 288, 304, 320, 336, 352, 368, 384, 400, 416, 432, 448, 464, 480, 496, 512, 528, 544, 560, 576, 592, 608, 624, 640, 656, 672, 688, 704, 720, 736, 752, 768, 784, 800, 816, 832, 848, 864, 880, 896, 912, 928, 944, 960, 976, 992, 1008, 1024, 1040, 1056, 1072, 1088, 1104, 1120, 1136, 1152, 1168, 1184, 1200, 1216, 1232, 1248, 1264, 1280, 1296, 1312, 1328, 1344, 1360, 1376, 1392, 1408, 1424, 1440, 1456, 1472, 1488, 1504, 1520, 1536, 1552, 1568, 1584, 1600, 1616, 1632, 1648, 1664, 1680, 1696, 1712, 1728, 1744, 1760, 1776, 1792, 1808, 1824, 1840, 1856, 1872, 1888, 1904, 1920, 1936, 1952, 1968, 1984, 2000, 2016, 2032, 2048, 2064, 2080, 2096, 2112, 2128, 2144, 2160, 2176, 2192, 2208, 2224, 2240, 2256, 2272, 2288, 2304, 2320, 2336, 2352, 2368, 2384, 2400, 2416, 2432, 2448, 2464, 2480, 2496, 2512, 2528, 2544, 2560, 2576, 2592, 2608, 2624, 2640, 2656, 2672, 2688, 2704, 2720, 2736, 2752, 2768, 2784, 2800, 2816, 2832, 2848, 2864, 2880, 2896, 2912, 2928, 2944, 2960, 2976, 2992, 3008, 3024, 3040, 3056, 3072, 3088, 3104, 3120, 3136, 3152, 3168, 3184, 3200, 3216, 3232, 3248, 3264, 3280, 3296, 3312, 3328, 3344, 3360, 3376, 3392, 3408, 3424, 3440, 3456, 3472, 3488, 3504, 3520, 3536, 3552, 3568, 3584, 3600, 3616, 3632, 3648, 3664, 3680, 3696, 3712, 3728, 3744, 3760, 3776, 3792, 3808, ",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\nStep 1: Find the semi-annual interest rate. Since the bond pays interest every six months, we need to find the semi-annual interest rate. We can do this by dividing the annual interest rate by 2:\n\nSemi-annual interest rate = 12% / 2 = 6%\n\nStep 2: Find the number of compounding periods. Since the bond pays interest every six months, there are two compounding periods:\n\nNumber of compounding periods = 2\n\nStep 3: Use the formula to find the future value of the bond. We can use the formula for compound interest to find the future value of the bond at maturity:\n\nFV = PV x (1 + r/n)^(n x t)\n\nwhere:\n\nFV = future value\nPV = present value\nr = interest rate per compounding period\nn = number of compounding periods per year\nt = number of years\n\nPlugging in the values we know:\n\nFV = $5,000 x (1 + 0.06/2)^(2 x 1)\nFV = $5,000 x 1.1236\nFV = $5,618\n\nStep 4: Find the interest accrued. To find the interest accrued, we need to subtract the initial investment from the future value:\n\nInterest accrued = $5,618 - $5,000\nInterest accrued = $618\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) $618.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume Joe's age as J, Joe's sister's age as S, and Joe's father's age as F.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that:\n\nJ + S + F = 100\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that when Joe is as old as his father:\n\nJ + F = 2(S)\n\nor\n\nJ = 2S - F\n\nFrom the third statement, we know that when Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father:\n\nF - J = 2(S - F)\n\nor\n\n3F - 2J - 2S = 0\n\nNow we have three equations with three variables. We can solve them simultaneously to find the values of J, S, and F.\n\nJ + S + F = 100\n\nJ = 2S - F\n\n3F - 2J - 2S = 0\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the third equation, we get:\n\n3F - 2(2S - F) - 2S = 0\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n7F - 4S = 0\n\nor\n\n7F = 4S\n\nSubstituting this equation into the first equation, we get:\n\nJ + S + (4/7)S = 100\n\nor\n\nJ + (11/7)S = 100\n\nSince J and S are integers, (11/7)S must be a fraction. The only way to make the left-hand side an integer is to make S a multiple of 7. Let's assume S = 7x.\n\nThen we have:\n\nJ + 11x = 100\n\nAlso, from the second equation:\n\nJ = 2S - F\n\nJ = 14x - F\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n14x - F + 11x = 100\n\nor\n\n25x - F = 100\n\nSince F is an integer, 25x must be a multiple of 4.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.\n\nLet's start by drawing a diagram to visualize the problem. We have points R, S, T, and U on a line, with U being the midpoint of ST. We also know that RS = 5, RT = 17, and ST = 22.\n\n```\nR-----S-----------T-----U\n     5    17      22\n```\n\nSince U is the midpoint of ST, we know that UT = ST/2 = 22/2 = 11.\n\n```\nR-----S-----------T-----U\n     5    17      22\n                  11\n```\n\nWe want to find the length of RU. We can do this by subtracting RT from UT and then subtracting RS from the result:\n\nRU = UT - RT - RS\n   = 11 - 17 - 5\n   = -11\n\nUh oh, we got a negative answer. This means that our assumption that U is the midpoint of ST is incorrect. Let's try a different approach.\n\nLet's assume that U is not the midpoint of ST. Instead, let's assume that RU = x and UT = y. Then, we know that ST = 2y and RT = 2x - 5 (since RS = 5 and RT + RS = ST).\n\n```\nR-----S-----------T-----U\n     5    2x-5    2y\n```\n\nSince U is the midpoint of ST, we know that y = 11. Substituting this into our equations, we get:\n\n2y = ST = 22\ny = 11\n\n2x - 5 + 5 = RT + RS = 17\n2x = 17\nx = 8.5\n\nTherefore, RU = x = 8.5, which means that the answer is (C) 8.",

The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5(\u221a3 + 1)  (B) 6(\u221a3 + \u221a2)  (C) 7(\u221a3 \u2013 1)  (D) 8(\u221a3 \u2013 2)  (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the height of the tower. Let's assume the height of the tower is h.\n\nWhen the angle of elevation is 45\u00b0, we have the following right triangle:\n\n```\n    |\\\nh   | \\\n    |  \\  x\n    |___\\\n   d  45\u00b0\n```\n\nwhere d is the distance between the car and the base of the tower, and x is the height of the tower above the car.\n\nUsing trigonometry, we have:\n\n```\ntan(45\u00b0) = x / d\nx = d\n```\n\nWhen the angle of elevation is 60\u00b0, we have the following right triangle:\n\n```\n    |\\\nh+x | \\\n    |  \\  x\n    |___\\\n   d  60\u00b0\n```\n\nUsing trigonometry again, we have:\n\n```\ntan(60\u00b0) = (x + h) / d\nx + h = d * tan(60\u00b0)\nx + h = d * \u221a3\n```\n\nNow we can solve for x:\n\n```\nx = d * \u221a3 - h\n```\n\nWe know that it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. Let's assume that the car travels a distance of y in this time.\n\nWe can use the formula for average speed:\n\n```\naverage speed = total distance / total time\n```\n\nThe total distance is d + y, and the total time is 10 minutes or 1/6 hour. The average speed is the speed of the car, which we don't know yet. Let's call it v.\n\n```\nv = (d + y) / (1/6)\n```\n\nWe also know that the car is moving at a uniform speed, so we can use the formula for distance:\n\n```\ndistance = speed * time\n```\n\nThe car travels a distance of y in the time it takes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. We can use trigonometry to find y:\n\n```\ntan(60\u00b0) = x / (d + y)\nx = (d + y) * \u221a3\n```\n\nSubstituting x, we get:\n\n```\n(d + y) * \u221a3 = d * \u221a3 - h\ny = d * (\u221a3 - 1) - h / \u221a3\n```\n\nNow we can substitute y into the equation for v:\n\n```\nv = (d + y) / (1/6)\nv = 6 * (d + y)\nv = 6 * (d + d * (\u221a3 - 1) - h / \u221a3)\nv = 6 * d * (\u221a3 + \u221a3 - 1 / \u221a3) - 2h\nv = 6 * d * (\u221a3 + \u221a3\u221a3 - 1) / 3 - 2h\nv = 6d(2\u221a3 - 1) / 3 - 2h\nv = 4d(2\u221a3 - 1) / 3 - 2h\n```\n\nFinally, we can use the formula for distance again to find the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower:\n\n```\ndistance = speed * time\nd = v * time\ntime = d / v\ntime = 3d / (4d(2\u221a3 - 1) / 3 - 2h)\ntime = 9d / (8d\u221a3 - 6h)\ntime = 9 / (8\u221a3 - 6h/d)\n```\n\nWe know that h/d = tan(45\u00b0) = 1, so:\n\n```\ntime = 9 / (8\u221a3 - 6)\ntime = 9(8\u221a3 + 6) / (64*3 - 36)\ntime = 9(8\u221a3 + 6) / 228\ntime = 4(\u221a3 + 1) / 19\n```\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 5(\u221a3 + 1).",

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, let's denote the number of files infected only by a virus as V, the number of files infected only by a worm as W, and the number of files infected by both as B. \n\nWe know that V + B = 0.5(250) = 125, since 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. \n\nWe also know that W = 2.5B, since the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. \n\nFinally, we know that V + W + B = 250, since all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. \n\nSubstituting the second equation into the third equation, we get V + 2.5B + B = 250, which simplifies to V + 3.5B = 250. \n\nSubstituting the first equation into this equation, we get 125 + 3.5B = 250, which simplifies to 3.5B = 125. \n\nSolving for B, we get B = 35. \n\nSubstituting this value of B into the equation W = 2.5B, we get W = 87.5. \n\nFinally, we can find the number of files not infected by a worm by subtracting the number of files infected by a worm from the total number of files: \n\n250 - 87.5 = 162.5 \n\nTherefore, the answer is not one of the given choices.

This means that out of every 5 parts of the alloy, 2 parts are zinc and 3 parts are copper. So, in 40 grams of alloy X, we have:\n\n- Zinc: (2/5) * 40 = 16 grams\n- Copper: (3/5) * 40 = 24 grams\n\nFor alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which does not simplify. So, in 60 grams of alloy Y, we have:\n\n- Zinc: (7/18) * 60 = 23.33 grams (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n- Copper: (11/18) * 60 = 36.67 grams (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n\nNow, we can find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z by adding the amounts from alloy X and alloy Y:\n\n- Zinc: 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n- Copper: 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n\nFinally, we can simplify the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z:\n\n- Zinc to copper: 39.33:60.67\n- Dividing both sides by 0.67 (the common factor): 59:91\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 59:91.",

In other words, if we pick 6 ties, there must be at least two of the same color.\n- Therefore, we need to pick at least 6 ties to be sure of getting at least two of the same color. The answer is (E) 6.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nLet's start by finding the length of the space diagonal of the rectangular solid. \n\nThe space diagonal of a rectangular solid is given by the formula: \n\nd = sqrt(l^2 + w^2 + h^2)\n\nwhere l, w, and h are the length, width, and height of the rectangular solid, respectively. \n\nSubstituting the given values, we get: \n\nd = sqrt(3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2) \n\nd = sqrt(9 + 16 + 225) \n\nd = sqrt(250) \n\nd = 5sqrt(10) \n\nNow, we know that the diameter of the sphere is equal to the space diagonal of the rectangular solid. \n\nTherefore, the diameter of the sphere is: \n\nD = 2d \n\nD = 2(5sqrt(10)) \n\nD = 10sqrt(10) \n\nSo, the answer is (E) 20.8888.",
