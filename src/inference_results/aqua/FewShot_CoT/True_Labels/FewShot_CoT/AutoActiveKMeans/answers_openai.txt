        "prompt": "You are an expert at arithmetic reasoning and are willing to solve algebraic word problems. Select the correct answer from the given options. If none of the options are correct, generate 'None of the above'. To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\n\nQ: If the range of the set of numbers {150, 90, 125, 110, 170, 155, x, 100, 140} is 90, which of the following could be x? Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 95 (C) 110 (D) 125 (E) 140\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe range of the other 8 numbers is 170-90 = 80, so x must be either the smallest number or the largest number in the set.\nThen x = 170-90 = 80 or x = 90+90 = 180\nThe answer is A. The answer is A.\n\nQ: the government was giving out 10500 after 6 years of living in the United States and 15500 after 12 years of living in the United Sates. how much is the interest per year. Answer Choices: (A) 12% (B) 20% (C) 15% (D) 10% (E) 5%\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nfor 6 years = (15500 - 10500) = 5000.\nfor 12 years = (5000x6)/6= 5000\nPrincipal = (10500 - 5000) = 5500.\nHence, rate = (100 x 5000)/(5500x6)\t% = 15% ANSWER :C The answer is C.\n\nQ: Three friends-whose walking rates are 1 ft./sec., 3ft./sec.,and 6ft./sec. start together walking in the same direction around a circular track that is 420 feet in circumference.After how many minutes are the three of them together again? Answer Choices: (A) 5 mins (B) 10 mins (C) 15 mins (D) 3 mins (E) 7 mins\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe time they take will be what the 1st friend takes to complete one circumference as he is the slowest and that is the point all 3 of them will be together at the end of 7 mins.\nE The answer is E.\n\nQ: The average of temperatures at noontime from Monday to Friday is 40; the lowest one is 30, what is the possible maximum range of the temperatures? Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 25 (C) 50 (D) 45 (E) 75\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nAverage=40, Sum of temperatures=40*5=200\nAs the min temperature is 30, max would be 200-4*30=80 --> The range=80(max)-30(min)=50\nAnswer: C The answer is C.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
