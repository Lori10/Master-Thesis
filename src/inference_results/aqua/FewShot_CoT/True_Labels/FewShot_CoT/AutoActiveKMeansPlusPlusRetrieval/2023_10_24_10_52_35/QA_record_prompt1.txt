            "Pred_Rationale": "We can use the formula for average speed, which is:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance traveled / Total time taken\n\nTo find the total distance traveled, we need to find the perimeter of the square. Let's assume that each side of the square is of length 'd'. Then, the perimeter is:\n\nPerimeter = 4d\n\nTo find the total time taken, we need to find the time taken to travel each side of the square. Let's assume that the time taken to travel each side is 't'. Then, we can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time\n\nFor the first side, we have:\n\nd = 200t\n\nFor the second side, we have:\n\nd = 400t\n\nFor the third side, we have:\n\nd = 600t\n\nFor the fourth side, we have:\n\nd = 800t\n\nAdding all these equations, we get:\n\n4d = 200t + 400t + 600t + 800t\n4d = 2000t\nt = d/5\n\nSubstituting this value of 't' in any of the above equations, we get:\n\nd = 1000t\n\nSubstituting the values of 'd' and 't' in the formula for perimeter, we get:\n\nPerimeter = 4d = 4000t\n\nTo find the total time taken, we need to add the time taken to travel each side:\n\nTotal time taken = t + t + t + t = 4t\n\nSubstituting the value of 't' in this equation, we get:\n\nTotal time taken = 4d/5\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of perimeter and total time taken in the formula for average speed:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance traveled / Total time taken\nAverage speed = Perimeter / Total time taken\nAverage speed = (4000t) / (4d/5)\nAverage speed = 5000d/4d\nAverage speed = 1250 km/hr\n\nTherefore, the average speed of the plane around the field is 1250 km/hr.\n\nAnswer: None of the above.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "The merchant can take advantage of the discount if he pays within 30 days. If he doesn't pay within 30 days, he has to pay the full amount of $20,000. If he pays within 30 days, he gets a discount of 4%, which is $800. So, he has to pay $19,200 within 30 days to take advantage of the discount.\n\nLet's assume that the merchant borrows money to pay the invoice and has to pay simple interest on the borrowed amount. Let's say he borrows $x at a simple interest rate of r% for 30 days. Then, the interest he has to pay is:\n\nInterest = (x * r * 30)/36500\n\nHe has to pay back $19,200 after 30 days, so:\n\nx + Interest = 19,200\n\nSubstituting the value of Interest, we get:\n\nx + (x * r * 30)/36500 = 19,200\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx(1 + (r * 30)/36500) = 19,200\n\nx = 19,200/(1 + (r * 30)/36500)\n\nThe merchant can afford to borrow money at a simple interest rate of r% if x is less than or equal to $20,000. So, we have:\n\n19,200/(1 + (r * 30)/36500) \u2264 20,000\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr \u2264 (36500/30) * ((20,000/19,200) - 1)\n\nr \u2264 247.67\n\nTherefore, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount is 247.67%.

At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day? Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the store had y yellow golf balls and w white golf balls at the beginning of the day. We know that the store sold 80% of its inventory, so it sold 0.8(600) = 480 golf balls. We also know that the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and sold all of its white golf balls. Therefore, the store sold w white golf balls, which means it also sold w yellow golf balls. Since the store sold a total of 480 golf balls, we can write the equation:\n\nw + w = 480\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2w = 480\n\nw = 240\n\nSo the store had 240 white golf balls at the beginning of the day.

This means that:\n\nV + B = 125\n\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get:\n\nV + 2.5B + B = 250\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nV + 3.5B = 250\n\nWe can substitute the third equation into this equation to get:\n\nV + 3.5(B/2.5) = 250\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nV + 1.4B = 250\n\nWe can now substitute the fourth equation into this equation to get:\n\n125 + 1.4B = 250\n\nSolving for B, we get:\n\nB = 75\n\nSubstituting this value back into the second equation, we get:\n\nW = 2.5(75) = 187.5\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a file, we know that 187 files are infected only by a worm.\n\nFinally, we can use the first equation to find the number of files that are not infected by a worm:\n\nV + B = 125\n\nSubstituting the value of B we found earlier, we get:\n\nV + 75 = 125\n\nSolving for V, we get:\n\nV = 50\n\nThis means that 50 files are not infected by a virus or a worm.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 50.",

If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ? Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's find the amount of zinc and copper in alloy X and Y separately.\n\nIn alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which can be simplified to 2:3. So, for every 2 parts of zinc, there are 3 parts of copper. Therefore, the amount of zinc and copper in 40 grams of alloy X are:\n\nZinc = 40 * (2/5) = 16 grams\nCopper = 40 * (3/5) = 24 grams\n\nIn alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which can be simplified to 1:1.57. So, for every 1 part of zinc, there are 1.57 parts of copper. Therefore, the amount of zinc and copper in 60 grams of alloy Y are:\n\nZinc = 60 * (1/2.57) = 23.34 grams\nCopper = 60 * (1.57/2.57) = 36.66 grams\n\nNow, let's find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z:\n\nZinc = 16 + 23.34 = 39.34 grams\nCopper = 24 + 36.66 = 60.66 grams\n\nTherefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:\n\nZinc : Copper = 39.34 : 60.66\n\nSimplifying this ratio by dividing both sides by 0.66, we get:\n\nZinc : Copper = 59 : 91\n\nSo, the answer is B. The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 59:91.",

Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the speed of the elevator is x steps/minute.\nAccording to the problem, when you walk 20 steps and stop, you reach the bottom in 10 minutes. This means that the elevator covers 20 steps in 10 minutes while you cover 20 steps in the same time. So, the relative speed between you and the elevator is 20/10 = 2 steps/minute.\nSimilarly, when you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach the ground in 20 minutes. This means that the elevator covers 10 steps in 20 minutes while you cover 10 steps in the same time. So, the relative speed between you and the elevator is 10/20 = 0.5 steps/minute.\nNow, we can set up an equation based on the relative speeds:\nx - 2 = 1/10  (since the elevator is moving down and you are moving down faster when you walk 20 steps)\nx - 0.5 = 1/20  (since the elevator is moving down and you are moving down slower when you walk 10 steps)\nSolving these equations, we get x = 3 steps/minute.\nTherefore, the speed of the elevator is 3 steps/minute.\nAnswer: Option C The answer is C.",

If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Given, the coin is made of an alloy of aluminum and silver. Let the volume of aluminum in the alloy be V. Then, the volume of silver in the alloy is also V.\n\nLet the density of aluminum be \u03c1a and the density of silver be \u03c1s. Then, the weight of aluminum in the alloy is V\u03c1a and the weight of silver in the alloy is V\u03c1s.\n\nWe know that the weight of the coin is 30 grams. Therefore, we have:\n\nV\u03c1a + V\u03c1s = 30\n\nWe also know that the volume of the coin is:\n\nV = \u03c0r^2h = \u03c0(7.5)^2(2) = 352.5 mm^3\n\nSince the volume of aluminum in the alloy is equal to the volume of silver in the alloy, we have:\n\nV\u03c1a = V\u03c1s\n\n\u03c1a = \u03c1s/2\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for the weight of the coin, we get:\n\nV\u03c1a + 2V\u03c1a = 30\n\n3V\u03c1a = 30\n\nV\u03c1a = 10\n\nThe weight of a coin made of pure aluminum with dimensions 1 x 30 mm (thickness x diameter) is:\n\nV\u03c1a' = \u03c0r'^2h'\u03c1a\n\nwhere r' = 15/2 = 7.5 mm and h' = 1 mm.\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nV\u03c1a' = \u03c0(7.5)^2(1)\u03c1a = 211.5\u03c1a\n\nSince \u03c1a = 10 g/cm^3, we have:\n\nV\u03c1a' = 2115 g = 2.115 kg\n\nTherefore, the weight of the coin made of pure aluminum is 2115 grams or 2.115 kg.\n\nAnswer: None of the above (The closest option is B, but it is not the correct answer.)",
