            "Pred_Rationale": "The total distance covered by the plane is the perimeter of the square, which is 4 times the length of one side. Let's assume the length of one side to be x km. Then, the total distance covered is 4x km.\n\nThe time taken to cover each side can be calculated using the formula: time = distance/speed. Therefore, the time taken to cover each side is:\n\n- For the first side: time = x/200\n- For the second side: time = x/400\n- For the third side: time = x/600\n- For the fourth side: time = x/800\n\nThe total time taken to cover all four sides is the sum of the time taken to cover each side. Therefore, the total time taken is:\n\nx/200 + x/400 + x/600 + x/800\n\nWe can simplify this expression by finding the least common multiple of the denominators, which is 2400. Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\n12x/2400 + 6x/2400 + 4x/2400 + 3x/2400\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n25x/2400\n\nThe average speed of the plane is the total distance covered divided by the total time taken. Therefore, the average speed is:\n\n4x/(25x/2400) = 96 km/hr\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 96 km/hr.",

Therefore, the total number of students is the sum of the number of students studying each subject.\nMinimum number of students = x/16 + x/10 + x/8\n= 31x/160\nSince x is a 4-digit number, the minimum value of x is 1000.\nTherefore, the minimum number of students = 31(1000)/160 = 193.75 (rounded to the nearest whole number = 194)\nTo find the maximum number of students, we assume that all the students are studying at least one subject. Therefore, the total number of students is the maximum value of x that satisfies this condition.\nThe maximum value of x occurs when the number of students studying math, bio, and English have no common factors.

Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's first find out the amount of zinc and copper in alloy X and Y.\nIn alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which can be simplified to 2:3. So, for every 2 parts of zinc, there are 3 parts of copper. Therefore, the amount of zinc and copper in 40 grams of alloy X are:\n\nZinc = 40 * (2/5) = 16 grams\nCopper = 40 * (3/5) = 24 grams\n\nSimilarly, in alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which can be simplified to 1:1.57. So, for every 1 part of zinc, there are 1.57 parts of copper. Therefore, the amount of zinc and copper in 60 grams of alloy Y are:\n\nZinc = 60 * (1/2.57) = 23.34 grams\nCopper = 60 * (1.57/2.57) = 36.66 grams\n\nNow, let's find out the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z:\n\nZinc = 16 + 23.34 = 39.34 grams\nCopper = 24 + 36.66 = 60.66 grams\n\nTherefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:\n\nZinc : Copper = 39.34 : 60.66\n\nSimplifying this ratio by dividing both sides by 0.66, we get:\n\nZinc : Copper = 59 : 91\n\nSo, the answer is B.",

Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Given, the coin is made of an alloy of aluminum and silver. Let the volume of aluminum in the alloy be V. Then the volume of silver in the alloy is also V. Let the density of aluminum be d. Then the density of silver is 2d. Let the weight of aluminum in the alloy be W. Then the weight of silver in the alloy is 2W.\n\nWe know that the volume of the coin is given by V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height of the coin. Substituting the given values, we get:\n\nV = \u03c0(7.5 mm)\u00b2(2 mm) = 352.5 mm\u00b3\n\nSince the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, we have:\n\nV = VAluminum + VSilver\n\nSubstituting the densities of aluminum and silver, we get:\n\nV = W/d + 2W/2d = 1.5W/d\n\nSolving for W, we get:\n\nW = Vd/1.5 = 352.5 mm\u00b3 \u00d7 d/1.5\n\nThe weight of the coin is given by:\n\n30 g = W + 2W = 3W\n\nSubstituting the value of W, we get:\n\n30 g = 352.5 mm\u00b3 \u00d7 d/1.5 + 2 \u00d7 352.5 mm\u00b3 \u00d7 d/1.5\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n30 g = 1057.5 mm\u00b3 \u00d7 d/1.5\n\nSolving for d, we get:\n\nd = 30 g \u00d7 1.5/1057.5 mm\u00b3 = 0.0425 g/mm\u00b3\n\nThe volume of the pure aluminum coin is given by:\n\nV = \u03c0r\u00b2h = \u03c0(15 mm/2)\u00b2(1 mm) = 176.625 mm\u00b3\n\nThe weight of the pure aluminum coin is given by:\n\nWeight = Volume \u00d7 Density = 176.625 mm\u00b3 \u00d7 0.0425 g/mm\u00b3 = 7.5 g\n\nAnswer: None of the above.",
