            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the coin landed on heads x times and tails y times. \n\nAccording to the problem, Christopher gave $2 to Jonathan for each head and Jonathan gave $3 to Christopher for each tail. \n\nSo, the total amount given by Christopher to Jonathan = 2x \n\nThe total amount given by Jonathan to Christopher = 3y \n\nAs per the problem, both of them won or lost nothing. \n\nSo, 2x = 3y \n\nAlso, the coin was flipped 20 times. \n\nSo, x + y = 20 \n\nWe need to find the value of x. \n\nFrom the first equation, we get: \n\nx = (3/2)y \n\nSubstituting this value of x in the second equation, we get: \n\n(3/2)y + y = 20 \n\nSolving for y, we get: \n\ny = 8 \n\nSubstituting this value of y in the equation x + y = 20, we get: \n\nx = 12 \n\nTherefore, the coin landed on heads 12 times. \n\nAnswer: E The answer is E.",

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's denote the number of files infected only by a virus as V, the number of files infected only by a worm as W, and the number of files infected by both as B. We know that:\n\nV + W + B = 250 (since all 250 files are infected)\nW = 2.5B (since the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number infected by both)\nV = 0.5(250 - B) (since 50% of the files were not infected by a virus)\n\nWe want to find the number of files that were not infected by a worm, which is equal to V + B. Substituting the second and third equations into the first equation, we get:\n\n0.5(250 - B) + 2.5B + B = 250\nSimplifying and solving for B, we get:\n\n3.5B = 125\nB = 35.71 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nTherefore, V = 0.5(250 - 35.71) = 107.14 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nAnd the number of files not infected by a worm is V + B = 107.14 + 35.71 = 142.85 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nAnswer: None of the above (since none of the answer choices match the calculated answer of 142.85)",

Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The volume of the coin is the volume of a cylinder with height 2 mm and radius 7.5 mm (half the diameter). So, the volume is \u03c0(7.5)^2(2) = 225\u03c0 mm^3.\n\nLet x be the volume of aluminum in the alloy. Then, the volume of silver is also x. Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of silver is 2x the weight of aluminum.\n\nThe total weight of the coin is 30 grams, so we can set up an equation:\n\n(weight of aluminum) + (weight of silver) = 30\nx\u03c1a + 2x\u03c1a = 30\n3x\u03c1a = 30\nx\u03c1a = 10\n\nwhere \u03c1a is the density of aluminum.\n\nSince the volume of aluminum in the coin is x, we can set up another equation using the density and volume of aluminum:\n\n(weight of aluminum) = \u03c1a(volume of aluminum)\n(weight of aluminum) = \u03c1a(x)\n\nNow, we can solve for the weight of a pure aluminum coin with the same volume as the aluminum in the alloy coin:\n\n(weight of pure aluminum coin) = \u03c1a(volume of aluminum)\n(weight of pure aluminum coin) = \u03c1a(x)\n(weight of pure aluminum coin) = \u03c1a(10)\n\nWe know that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, so we can set up a ratio of the weights of silver and aluminum:\n\n(weight of silver) = 2(weight of aluminum)\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for the total weight of the coin, we get:\n\n(weight of aluminum) + 2(weight of aluminum) = 30\n3(weight of aluminum) = 30\n(weight of aluminum) = 10\n\nSo, the weight of aluminum in the alloy coin is 10 grams. Therefore, the weight of a pure aluminum coin with the same volume is:\n\n(weight of pure aluminum coin) = \u03c1a(10)\n(weight of pure aluminum coin) = (2.7 g/cm^3)(10 cm^3)\n(weight of pure aluminum coin) = 27 grams\n\nAnswer: The weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum is 27 grams.
