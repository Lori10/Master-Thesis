If none of the options are correct, generate 'None of the above'. To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\n\nQ: A and B start a business, with A investing the total capital of Rs.50000, on the condition that B pays A interest @ 10% per annum on his half of the capital. A is a working partner and receives Rs.1500 per month from the total profit and any profit remaining is equally shared by both of them. At the end of the year, it was found that the income of A is twice that of B. Find the total profit for the year? Answer Choices: (A) 59028 (B) 59010 (C) 59190 (D) 59000 (E) 92700\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nInterest received by A from B = 10% of half of Rs.50000 = 10% * 25000 = 2500.\nAmount received by A per annum for being a working partner = 1500 * 12 = Rs.18000.\nLet 'P' be the part of the remaining profit that A receives as his share. Total income of A = (2500 + 18000 + P)\nTotal income of B = only his share from the remaining profit = 'P', as A and B share the remaining profit equally.\nIncome of A = Twice the income of B\n(2500 + 18000 + P) = 2(P)\nP = 20500\nTotal profit = 2P + 18000\n= 2*20500 + 18000 = 59000\nAnswer:D The answer is D.\n\nQ: The percentage profit earned by selling an article for Rs. 1920 is equal to the percentage loss incurred by selling the same article for Rs. 1280. At what price should the article be sold to make 25% profit? Answer Choices: (A) 3000 (B) 1230 (C) 2000 (D) 5600 (E) 3400\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nC\nC.P. be Rs. x.\nThen, (1920 - x)/x * 100 = (x - 1280)/x * 100\n1920 - x = x - 1280\n2x = 3200 => x = 1600\nRequired S.P. = 125 % of Rs. 1600 = 125/100 * 1600 = Rs. 2000. The answer is C.\n\nQ: A man sells an article at a gain 15%. If he had bought it at 10% less and sold it for 6 less, he would have gained 25%. Find the cost price of the article. Answer Choices: (A) 150 (B) 160 (C) 170 (D) 180 (E) 240\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nLet the C.P. be 100\nFirst S.P. = 115\nSecond C.P. = 90\nSecond S.P = 125% of 90 = 112.50\nDifference of two selling prices is 115 \u2013 112.50 = 2.50 and C.P. of the article is 100\nBut actual difference is 6.\n\u2234 C.P. = 100\u20442.50 \u00d7 6 = 240.\nAnswer E The answer is E.\n\nQ: C and D started a business by investing Rs.1000/- and Rs.1500/- respectively. Find the D\u2019s share out of a total profit of Rs.500: Answer Choices: (A) 400 (B) 300 (C) 200 (D) 100 (E) 150\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nC = Rs.1000/-\nD = Rs.1500/-\nC share 2 parts & D share 3 parts\nTotal 5 parts -----> Rs.500/-\n----> 1 part -------> Rs.100/-\nD share = 3 parts -----> Rs.300/-\nD The answer is D.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step."

This can be calculated using the formula for combinations: \n\nnCr = n! / r!(n-r)!\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to be selected, and ! denotes factorial (i.e., the product of all positive integers up to that number). \n\nUsing this formula, we get: \n\n11C3 = 11! / 3!(11-3)! = 11! / 3!8! = (11*10*9) / (3*2*1) = 165\n\nSo there are 165 possible combinations of 3 candy bars that can be selected from the 11 candy bars. \n\nNext, we need to find the combinations where the total cost is more than $4. We can do this by counting the number of combinations that include at least one candy bar that costs $2, since we need at least two candy bars that cost $1 or more to exceed $4. \n\nThere are 4 candy bars that cost $2, so we can select one of these in 4C1 = 4 ways. \n\nFor the remaining two candy bars, we need to select at least one candy bar that costs $1 or more.

Let's assume that this age is X.\nSo, we have:\nJ + X = F + X/2\nSolving this equation, we get:\nF = 2J - S\nFrom the third statement, we know that when Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Let's assume that the age of Joe's sister when her father was as old as her was Y.\nSo, we have:\nF + X = 2(Y + S)\nSubstituting the value of F from the second equation, we get:\n2J - S + X = 2(Y + S)\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n2J - 2Y = S + X\nNow, we have three equations:\nJ + S + F = 100\nJ + X = F + X/2\n2J - 2Y = S + X\nWe need to find the value of F.\nLet's solve these equations one by one:\nFrom the first equation, we get:\nF = 100 - J - S\nSubstituting this value of F in the second equation, we get:\nJ + X = (100 - J - S) + X/2\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n3J + X = 200 - 3S\nSubstituting the value of X from the third equation, we get:\n3J + S + 2J - 2Y = 200\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n5J + S - 2Y = 200\nNow, we need to eliminate S and Y from this equation. For that, we can use the first equation:\nS = 100 - J - F\nSubstituting this value of S in the above equation, we get:\n5J + (100 - J - F) - 2Y = 200\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n4J - F - 2Y = 100\nNow, we can use the second equation to eliminate Y:\n2J - 2Y = S + X\nSubstituting the value of S from the first equation and the value of X from the second equation, we get:\n2J - 2Y = 100 - F + X/2\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n4J - 2Y = 200 - 2F + X\nSubstituting the value of X from the second equation, we get:\n4J - 2Y = 200 - 2F + 2(J + X - F)\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n2J - Y = 100 - F + J + X\nSubstituting the value of X from the second equation, we get:\n2J - Y = 100 - F + J + F + J/2\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n5J - 2Y = 200\nNow, we have two equations:\n4J - F - 2Y = 100\n5J - 2Y = 200\nWe need to eliminate Y from these equations. For that, we can multiply the second equation by 2 and subtract it from the first equation:\n4J - F - 2Y - 10J + 4Y = 100 - 400\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n-6J - F + 4Y = -300\nNow, we can use the second equation to eliminate Y:\n5J - 2Y = 200\n2Y = 5J - 200\nY = (5J - 200)/2\nSubstituting this value of Y in the above equation, we get:\n-6J - F + 2.5J - 100 = -300\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n-3.5J - F = -200\nWe know that J + S + F = 100\nSubstituting the value of F from the above equation, we get:\nJ + S - 3.5J + 200 = 100\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n-2.5J + S = -100\nWe also know that J + X = F + X/2\nSubstituting the value of F from the above equation, we get:\nJ + X = 2J - S + X/2\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\nS = 3J - X\nSubstituting this value of S in the above equation,",

The only way this can happen is if B = 42 (since 2.5 times 42 is 105, which is a whole number). \n\nSubstituting B = 42 into the second equation, we get: \n\nW = 2.5(42) = 105 \n\nSubstituting B = 42 and W = 105 into the first equation, we get: \n\nV + 105 + 42 = 250 \n\nV = 103 \n\nSubstituting V = 103 and B = 42 into the third equation, we get: \n\nV = 0.5(250 - 42) \n\nV = 104 \n\nThis is a contradiction, so our initial assumption that B = 42 must be incorrect. \n\nTherefore, there is no solution to this problem with whole numbers. \n\nNone of the above.",

Therefore, the amount of zinc and copper in 40 grams of alloy X are:\n\nZinc in X = (2/5) * 40 = 16 grams\nCopper in X = (3/5) * 40 = 24 grams\n\nIn alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which can be simplified to 1:1.57 (approx). So, for every 1 part of zinc, there are 1.57 parts of copper. Therefore, the amount of zinc and copper in 60 grams of alloy Y are:\n\nZinc in Y = (1/2.57) * 60 = 23.34 grams (approx)\nCopper in Y = (1.57/2.57) * 60 = 36.66 grams (approx)\n\nNow, let's find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z:\n\nTotal zinc in Z = 16 + 23.34 = 39.34 grams (approx)\nTotal copper in Z = 24 + 36.66 = 60.66 grams (approx)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is approximately 39.34:60.66, which can be simplified to 59:91.\n\nAnswer: B.
