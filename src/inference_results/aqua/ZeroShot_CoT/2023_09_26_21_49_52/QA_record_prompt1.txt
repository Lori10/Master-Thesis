            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we calculate how long it takes Shweta to travel 15 km without rest. The speed is 10 km/h, so it takes her 15 km / 10 km/h = 1.5 hours.\n\nNext, we calculate how many 15 km sections are in 100 km. This is 100 km / 15 km = 6.67. Since she can't travel a fraction of a distance, we round this up to 7. This means she will take 7 rests.\n\nEach rest is 10 minutes, so 7 rests will take 7 * 10 minutes = 70 minutes. We convert this to hours by dividing by 60, getting approximately 1.17 hours.\n\nFinally, we add the time spent traveling and resting. The time spent traveling is 7 * 1.5 hours = 10.5 hours.

We know that:\n\nW + B = 18 (since Jack bought 18 sharpeners in total)\n\nWe also know that each white sharpener costs 1 rupee more than each brown sharpener. If we denote the cost of a brown sharpener as x, then the cost of a white sharpener is x + 1. Since Jack spent 100 rupees in total, we have:\n\nW*(x + 1) + B*x = 100\n\nWe can substitute B = 18 - W from the first equation into the second equation to get:\n\nW*(x + 1) + (18 - W)*x = 100\n\nSolving this equation for x, we get x = 4.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's denote the distance between Winson's home and his school as D (in miles). \n\nWhen Winson runs to school, he travels at a speed of 10 miles/hr. Therefore, the time it takes him to run to school is D/10 hours.\n\nWhen Winson walks home, he travels at a speed of 5 miles/hr. Therefore, the time it takes him to walk home is D/5 hours.\n\nAccording to the problem, the total time for the journey is 1 hour. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\nD/10 + D/5 = 1\n\nTo solve this equation, we first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 10:\n\nD + 2D = 10\n\n3D = 10\n\nD = 10/3 \u2248 3.33\n\nTherefore, the distance between Winson's home and his school is approximately 3.33 miles.

Since the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, we can set up the equation 1/2 * base * height = 70. \n\nSince the rectangle was formed by cutting 4 feet from one edge of the square, the base and height of the triangle are not equal. Let's say the original side of the square is x feet. Then, the base of the triangle is x feet and the height is x - 4 feet. \n\nSubstituting these into the equation, we get 1/2 * x * (x - 4) = 70.

Since the fan makes 300 revolutions per minute, in 30 seconds (which is half a minute), it would make 300/2 = 150 revolutions.\n\nThe distance traveled in one revolution is the circumference of the circle, which is 2\u03c0r, where r is the radius of the circle. In this case, r = 10 cm, so the distance traveled in one revolution is 2\u03c0*10 = 20\u03c0 cm.\n\nTherefore, in 150 revolutions, the point would travel 150*20\u03c0 = 3000\u03c0 cm.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) 3000\u03c0.",

The perimeter of a square is 4*side. Since the total length of the wire is the same as the perimeter of the square, we can set up the equation 4*side = 88 cm.\n\nSolving for side, we get side = 88 cm / 4 = 22 cm.\n\nSo, the measure of each side of the square is 22 cm. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) 22.",

Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to calculate the total production cost for a year. The company produces 420 units per month, so in a year (12 months), it produces 420 * 12 = 5040 units. The production cost for each unit is $110, so the total production cost for a year is 5040 * 110 = $554,400.\n\nThe company wants to make a profit of at least $626,400 in a year. So, the total revenue (sales) it needs to make in a year is the production cost plus the profit, which is 554400 + 626400 = $1,180,800.\n\nNow, to find the minimum selling price per component, we divide the total revenue needed by the number of units produced in a year. So, the minimum selling price per component is 1180800 / 5040 = $234.2857.\n\nSo, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee the yearly profit is more than $234.2857.

            "Question": "Q: A father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan who are 23 and 24 at present. He divides the amount in such a way that if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. Find Mohan's share. Answer Choices: (A) 2400 (B) 2500 (C) 2600 (D) 2700 (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The father wants to divide the money in such a way that both sons will have the same amount when they turn 26. This means that Mohan's money will be invested for 3 years (from age 23 to 26) and Sohan's money will be invested for 2 years (from age 24 to 26).\n\nLet's denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's share as S. We know that M + S = 5100.\n\nThe compound interest formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest, P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money), r is the annual interest rate (in decimal), n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year, and t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nSince the interest is compounded annually (n=1), and the rate is 4% (r=0.04), the formula simplifies to A = P(1 + r)^t.\n\nFor Mohan, the amount after 3 years will be M(1 + 0.04)^3 and for Sohan, the amount after 2 years will be S(1 + 0.04)^2. Since both amounts are equal, we can write the equation M(1 + 0.04)^3 = S(1 + 0.04)^2.\n\nSubstituting S = 5100 - M into the equation, we get M(1 + 0.04)^3 = (5100 - M)(1 + 0.04)^2.\n\nSolving this equation for M, we get M \u2248 2600.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (C) 2600.",

Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk.\nWhat is the final concentration of tea John drinks? Answer Choices: (A) 15.38% (B) 42% (C) 39.86% (D) 22.35% (E) 32.51%",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, John has a 50% strong milk tea. When he replaces 15% of it with milk, the concentration of tea becomes 85% of the original 50%, which is 0.85 * 50 = 42.5%.\n\nThen, he does this again. So, the concentration of tea becomes 85% of 42.5%, which is 0.85 * 42.5 = 36.125%.\n\nFinally, he replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk. So, the final concentration of tea becomes 90% of 36.125%, which is 0.9 * 36.125 = 32.5125%.\n\nSo, the final concentration of tea John drinks is approximately 32.51%.

Because of this, each of the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 more than initially planned, so they each contributed Rs. 96/x + 4.\n\nThe total cost of the picnic is still Rs. 96, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n(96/x + 4) * (x - 4) = 96\n\nSolving this equation for x gives us x = 12.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The store sold 80% of its inventory, which means it sold 80/100 * 600 = 480 golf balls. Since it sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it means it sold 480/2 = 240 of each color. If all the white golf balls were sold, it means the store initially had 240 white golf balls.

Now we have two identical equations, which means the costs of one soda and one and a half energy bars are the same. Therefore, the cost of half an energy bar is zero, and the cost of one soda and two energy bars (which is 150 cents) is the same as the cost of one soda. So, one soda costs 150 cents and one energy bar costs 0 cents.\n\nThe cost of six sodas and seven bars is then 6*150 + 7*0 = 900 cents. So, the correct answer is (E) 900.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's denote the number of times the coin landed on heads as H and the number of times it landed on tails as T. We know that H + T = 20 (because the coin was flipped 20 times) and that 2H = 3T (because no money was won or lost). \n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of H and T. \n\nSubstituting H = 20 - T into the second equation gives us 2(20 - T) = 3T. \n\nSolving this equation gives us T = 12. \n\nSubstituting T = 12 into the first equation gives us H = 20 - 12 = 8. \n\nSo, the coin landed on heads 8 times. \n\nHowever, this option is not given in the answer choices.

            "Question": "Q: Three friends Alan, Roger and Peter attempt to answer a question on an exam. Alan randomly guesses the answer, giving him a 1/5 probability of guessing correctly. Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, giving him a 2/3 probability of answering correctly. And Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer. What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating? Answer Choices: (A) 1/18 (B) 1/9 (C) 23/90 (D) 5/18 (E) 13/45",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means we are looking for the probability that either Alan or Peter answer correctly, but not Roger. \n\nThe probability that either Alan or Peter answer correctly is the sum of their individual probabilities, because these are independent events. So, the probability is 1/5 (Alan's probability) + 5/6 (Peter's probability) = 6/30 + 25/30 = 31/30. \n\nHowever, this is greater than 1, which is not possible for a probability. The mistake here is that we cannot simply add the probabilities of Alan and Peter, because these events are not mutually exclusive - it's possible that they could both answer correctly. \n\nInstead, we should calculate the probability that at least one of them answers correctly. This is equal to 1 minus the probability that both of them answer incorrectly. \n\nThe probability that Alan answers incorrectly is 1 - 1/5 = 4/5, and the probability that Peter answers incorrectly is 1 - 5/6 = 1/6. So, the probability that both of them answer incorrectly is (4/5) * (1/6) = 4/30 = 2/15. \n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one of them answers correctly is 1 - 2/15 = 13/15. \n\nSo, the correct answer is 'None of the above'.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "The area that the cow can graze is a circle with a radius of 14 feet (the length of the rope). The area of a circle is given by the formula \u03c0r\u00b2. So, the total area the cow can graze is \u03c0*14\u00b2 = 616 square feet.\n\nIf the cow grazes 10 square feet per day, then the time taken to graze the whole field is 616/10 = 61.6 days. Since a cow can't graze for a fraction of a day, we'll round this up to the nearest whole number.\n\nSo, the cow will take approximately 62 days to graze the whole field.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we know that the sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers is 5 times the middle number (because the two numbers on either side of the middle number balance each other out). \n\nSo, we can write the sum as 5n, where n is the middle number. \n\nWe are told that this sum, when divided by 10, is a perfect square. So, 5n/10 = m^2, where m is some integer. \n\nSimplifying, we get n/2 = m^2. \n\nThis means that n, the middle number, must be twice a perfect square. \n\nLooking at the answer choices, we see that only 44 is not an odd number, so it can't be the answer. \n\nFor the remaining choices, we check if twice the number is a perfect square. \n\nFor 47, twice the number is 94, which is not a perfect square. \n\nFor 91, twice the number is 182, which is not a perfect square. \n\nFor 41, twice the number is 82, which is not a perfect square. \n\nFor 67, twice the number is 134, which is not a perfect square. \n\nSo, none of the options are correct.

In this right triangle, the height of the tower is y * \u221a3 (because sin(60\u00b0) = \u221a3 / 2).\n\nSince the height of the tower doesn't change, we have x = y * \u221a3.\n\nThe car travels the distance x - y in 10 minutes.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find out Bill's speed on a windy day. We know that his normal speed is 15 mph and the wind reduces his speed by 4 mph. So, his speed on a windy day is 15 - 4 = 11 mph.\n\nNext, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours because the speed is given in miles per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 21 minutes is 21/60 = 0.35 hours.\n\nFinally, we can find out how far Bill can travel by multiplying his speed by the time.

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, since 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, that means 50% of 250 files were infected by a virus, which is 125 files.\n\nLet's denote the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm as x. According to the problem, the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5x.\n\nSo, the total number of files infected by a worm (those infected by both a virus and a worm and those infected only by a worm) is x + 2.5x = 3.5x.\n\nWe know that this number plus the number of files infected only by a virus equals the total number of files infected by a virus, which is 125. But since no file is infected only by a virus (as all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both), we have 3.5x = 125.\n\nSolving this equation for x gives x = 125 / 3.5 = 35.71, which is not possible since the number of files must be an integer. Therefore, there seems to be a mistake in the problem statement. So, the correct answer is 'None of the above'.",

Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find out how much zinc and copper are in each alloy.\n\nIn alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9. This means that for every 15 parts of the alloy, 6 parts are zinc and 9 parts are copper. If we have 40 grams of alloy X, then the amount of zinc is (6/15)*40 = 16 grams and the amount of copper is (9/15)*40 = 24 grams.\n\nIn alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11. This means that for every 18 parts of the alloy, 7 parts are zinc and 11 parts are copper. If we have 60 grams of alloy Y, then the amount of zinc is (7/18)*60 = 23.33 grams and the amount of copper is (11/18)*60 = 36.67 grams.\n\nNow, if we melt and mix these two alloys to form alloy Z, the total amount of zinc will be 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams and the total amount of copper will be 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams.\n\nThe ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is therefore 39.33:60.67. To simplify this ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is approximately 0.67. This gives us a ratio of approximately 59:91.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (B) 59:91.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to understand that the time it takes to reach the bottom is not only dependent on the number of steps you walk, but also on the time the elevator takes to reach the bottom. \n\nIn the first scenario, you walk 20 steps and it takes 10 minutes to reach the bottom. This means that in the time it takes you to walk 20 steps, the elevator also reaches the bottom. \n\nIn the second scenario, you walk 10 steps and it takes 20 minutes to reach the bottom. This means that in the time it takes you to walk 10 steps, the elevator also reaches the bottom. \n\nFrom these two scenarios, we can see that the elevator's speed is consistent, because in both cases, the elevator reaches the bottom in the time it takes you to walk a certain number of steps. \n\nTherefore, the speed of the elevator is the same as your walking speed. \n\nIn the first scenario, your walking speed is 20 steps/10 minutes = 2 steps/minute. \n\nSo, the speed of the elevator is also 2 steps/minute. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 2 step/minute.",

Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",

The volume of a cylinder (which is the shape of the coin) is given by the formula V=\u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height (or thickness in this case). The radius is half the diameter, so r=15/2=7.5 mm. So, the volume of the original coin is V=\u03c0*(7.5)\u00b2*2=\u03c0*56.25*2=112.5\u03c0 mm\u00b3.\n\nSince the volume of aluminum equals that of silver in the original coin, each metal contributes half of the total volume, so the volume of aluminum in the original coin is 112.5\u03c0/2=56.25\u03c0 mm\u00b3.\n\nThe weight of the original coin is 30 grams, and since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of the aluminum in the original coin is 30/3=10 grams.\n\nSo, the density of aluminum (which is mass/volume) is 10 grams/56.25\u03c0 mm\u00b3.\n\nNow, let's find the volume of the new coin.
