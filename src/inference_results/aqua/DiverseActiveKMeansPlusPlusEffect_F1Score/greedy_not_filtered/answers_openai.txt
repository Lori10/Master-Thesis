        "prompt": "You are an expert at arithmetic reasoning and are willing to solve algebraic word problems. Select the correct answer from the given options. If none of the options are correct, generate 'None of the above'. To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\n\nQ: What is the perimeter, in meters, of a rectangular garden 24 meters wide that has the same area as a rectangular playground 16 meters long and 12 meters wide? Answer Choices: (A) 48 (B) 56 (C) 64 (D) 76 (E) 192\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Say Length of garden is L meters. Then (L*24) = 16 * 12 [Given area is same. Area= L * B] Therefore L works out to 8 meters. Perimeter of Garden = 2* (8+24) = 64 meter. Answer is C The answer is C.\n\nQ: Of three numbers, the third is twice the second and the second is 4 times the first. If their average is 78, the smallest of the three numbers is: Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 19 (C) 20 (D) 21 (E) 22\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Explanation: Let first number be x. So,2nd no. = 4x & 3rd no.=8x. So,x+4x+8x=78 \u00d7 3 = 234. 13x = 234 x = 234/13 Hence,smallest Number x=18. Answer: A The answer is A.\n\nQ: A certain car uses one gallon of gasoline every 40 miles when it travels on highway, and one gallon of gasoline every 20 miles when it travels in the city. When a car travels 4 miles on highway and 4 additional miles in the city, it uses what percent more gasoline than if it travels 8 miles on the highway? Answer Choices: (A) 15% (B) 20% (C) 22.5% (D) 25% (E) 50%\n\nA: Let's think step by step. 4 miles on the highway = 4/40 gallons; 4 miles in the city = 4/20 gallons; Total = 4/40 + 4/20 = 3/10 gallons. 8 miles on the highway = 8/40 gallons . The % change = (3/10 - 8/40)/(8/40) = 1/2 = 0.50. Answer: E. The answer is E.\n\nQ: If d is the standard deviation a, b, and c, what is the standard deviation of a +6, b + 6, c + 6 ? Answer Choices: (A) d (B) 6d (C) 6d+6 (D) 6d+12 (E) 6d+18\n\nA: Let's think step by step. CONCEPT: Standard Deviation is Defined as Average Deviation of Terms in the set from the Mean value of the set. i.e. 1) It depends on the separation between the successive terms of the set 2) If a Constant Value is Added/Subtracted in every terms of set then the Separation between successive terms does NOT change Hence S.D. remains Constant e.g.{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} will have same standard Deviation as {1+10, 2+10, 3+10, 4+10, 5+10} 3) If a Constant Value is Multiplied in every terms then the Separation between succesive terms gets multiplied by the constant Hence S.D. remains gets multiplied by same Number e.g. {0.7, 1.4, 2.1, 2.8, 3.5} will have Standard Deviation = 0.7* Standard deviation of set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} When 6 is added in each term of set {a, b,c} then the new set {a+6, b+6, c+6} will remain same as the previous standard deviation i.e. d Answer: A The answer is A.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
