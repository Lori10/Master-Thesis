Answer Choices: (A) (zy \u2013 2x) /z (B) (zy \u2013 2) /z (C) (zx \u2013 y) /(z \u2013 2)  (D) (zy \u2013 2x) /(z -2)  (E) (zy \u2013 x) /(z + 2) ",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the highest score be H and the lowest score be L. We know that (H + L)/2 = x. Therefore, H + L = 2x.\n\nLet the sum of all the scores be S. We know that the average score for the entire class is y. Therefore, S/z = y, which means S = yz.\n\nIf we exclude the highest and lowest scorers, we need to subtract H and L from S and divide by z - 2 (since there are two fewer students now). Therefore, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is:\n\n(S - H - L)/(z - 2) = (yz - H - L)/(z - 2)\n\nWe know that H + L = 2x, so we can substitute that in:\n\n(yz - 2x)/(z - 2)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) (zy \u2013 2x) /(z -2).",

We can start by trying some values of y:\n\n- If y = 0, then 20x = 340, so x = 17.

This works because x + y = 16, which means the diver made 16 dives.\n- If y = 2, then 20x + 50 = 340, so 20x = 290 and x = 14.5.

After Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places, the number of children between them becomes 6. So, (x - 17) - 6 = (12 + 2) + (6 - 2) - 1.

Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the distance between X and Y be d km. Let the time taken by both Allen and Bob to meet for the first time be t hours. Then, we have:\n\nDistance covered by Allen in t hours = 54t\nDistance covered by Bob in t hours = 78t\n\nWhen they meet for the first time, the total distance covered by both of them is d. Therefore, we have:\n\n54t + 78t = d\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n132t = d\n\nNow, let's consider the second meeting. By the time they meet for the second time, Allen has covered a distance of d km, while Bob has covered a distance of d + 48 km. Let the time taken by both of them to meet for the second time be t2 hours. Then, we have:\n\nDistance covered by Allen in t2 hours = 54t2\nDistance covered by Bob in t2 hours = 78t2 + 48\n\nWhen they meet for the second time, the total distance covered by both of them is 2d + 48. Therefore, we have:\n\n54t2 + 78t2 + 48 = 2d + 48\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n132t2 = 2d\n\nDividing this equation by the first equation, we get:\n\nt2/t = 2\n\nSubstituting the value of t from the first equation, we get:\n\nt2 = 2d/132\n\nSubstituting this value of t2 in the second equation, we get:\n\n54(2d/132) + 78(2d/132) + 48 = 2d + 48\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nd = 144\n\nTherefore, the distance between X and Y is 144 km.

Then, the length of the room is 10x/2x = 5m and breadth of the room is 2(5x)/2x = 10m. The total area of the four walls = 2h(l+b) = 2(2x)(5+10) = 30x. The area of doors and windows = 15 sq.m. Therefore, the area of the four walls to be papered = 30x - 15. The cost of papering the walls = Rs.260. The cost of papering 1 sq.m of the wall = 260/(30x-15) The width of the paper is 50cm = 0.5m. Therefore, the length of the paper required to paper the wall = (perimeter of the room) * (height of the room) = 5x * 2x = 10x^2. The length of the paper required to paper the four walls = 2(5+10) * 2x = 30x. Therefore, the number of meters of paper required = 30x/0.5 = 60x. The cost of 1 meter of paper = Rs.2.

We also know that the store sold 80% of its inventory, so it sold 0.8 * 600 = 480 golf balls in total. \n\nSince the store sold all of its white golf balls, we know that w/2 = 480 - y.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The first train that comes can be either from the main line or the harbor line. The main line train comes every 10 minutes starting from 5 o'clock.

Answer Choices: (A) 13x/2 (B) 13x/2 - 6 (C) 13x/24 (D) (13x+1) /24 (E) (13x-12) /24",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's first find the length of x pickets. Length of x pickets = x * 1/2 = x/2 inches. Now, we need to add the length of the spaces between the pickets. There are (x-1) spaces between the pickets. Each space is 6 inches wide. So, the total length of the spaces = 6(x-1) = 6x - 6 inches. Therefore, the total length of the fence = length of pickets + length of spaces = x/2 + 6x - 6 = 13x/2 - 6 inches. But the answer choices are in feet. So, we need to convert the answer to feet by dividing by 12. Therefore, the answer is (13x/2 - 6)/12 = 13x/24 - 1/2 feet. Answer: (C)",

Then the weight of silver in the coin is 2x grams. Since the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, we have:\n\n\u03c1(Al) * x = \u03c1(Ag) * 2x\n\n\u03c1(Ag)/\u03c1(Al) = 2\n\nLet the weight of the pure aluminum coin be y grams. Then its volume is:\n\n\u03c0r\u00b2h = \u03c0(15)\u00b2(1) = 225\u03c0 mm\u00b3\n\nSince the density of aluminum is \u03c1(Al) = y/V, we have:\n\ny = \u03c1(Al) * V = \u03c1(Al) * 225\u03c0\n\nThe weight of the pure aluminum coin is:\n\ny = \u03c1(Al) * 225\u03c0 = (\u03c1(Ag)/2) * 225\u03c0 = (30 - x)/2 * 225\u03c0\n\nWe know that the weight of the alloy coin is 30 grams, so:\n\nx/\u03c1(Al) + 2x/\u03c1(Ag) = 30\n\nSubstituting \u03c1(Ag)/\u03c1(Al) = 2, we get:\n\nx/\u03c1(Al) + x/\u03c1(Al)/2 = 30\n\n3x/\u03c1(Al) = 30\n\nx = 10\u03c1(Al)\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for the weight of the pure aluminum coin, we get:\n\ny = (30 - x)/2 * 225\u03c0 = (30 - 10\u03c1(Al))/2 * 225\u03c0 = 3375\u03c0 - 1125\u03c1(Al)\n\nSubstituting the density of aluminum, we get:\n\ny = 3375\u03c0 - 1125(2.7) = 3375\u03c0 - 3037.5 \u2248 337.5\u03c0\n\nThe weight of the pure aluminum coin is:\n\ny \u2248 337.5\u03c0 * 0.0027 * 9.8 \u2248 8.3 grams\n\nAnswer: None of the above.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can use the Pigeonhole Principle to solve this problem. Since we want at least two ties of the same color, we can assume that we pick ties randomly and keep adding them to our collection until we have two ties of the same color. \n\nThe worst-case scenario is that we pick one tie of each color before we get a repeat. In that case, we would need to pick 5 more ties to get a repeat (since we already have 5 colors represented). \n\nTherefore, we need to pick at least 5 + 1 = 6 ties to guarantee that we have at least two ties of the same color. \n\nAnswer: E) 6",
