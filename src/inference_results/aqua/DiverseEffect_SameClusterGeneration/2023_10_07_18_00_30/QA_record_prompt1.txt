Since the ratio of rice to the total mixture is 2:10 (2+3+5), we can set up a proportion:\n\n2/10 = 3/x\n\nwhere x is the number of parts of the mixture in 3 pounds of rice. \n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n2x = 30\n\nDividing by 2, we get:\n\nx = 15/1.5 = 10\n\nSo 3 pounds of rice is 10 parts of the mixture. \n\nSince the ratio of corn to the total mixture is 5:10, we can set up another proportion:\n\n5/10 = y/10\n\nwhere y is the number of parts of corn in the mixture. \n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\ny = 5\n\nSo the bag of mixture contains 5 parts of corn, which is equivalent to:\n\n5/10 * 3 pounds = 1.5 pounds\n\nAnswer: None of the above.

Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The merchant can take advantage of the discount if he pays within 30 days. The remaining amount will be paid after n days with an additional interest rate. \n\nIf the merchant takes advantage of the discount, he will pay only 96% of the invoice amount, which is $20,000 x 0.96 = $19,200.\n\nLet's assume that the merchant borrows the money for n days at a simple interest rate of r%. Then, the interest he will pay is:\n\nI = P x r x t\n\nwhere P is the principal amount borrowed, t is the time in years, and I is the interest paid.\n\nThe time t can be calculated as:\n\nt = n / 365\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\n$800 = $19,200 x r x (n / 365)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nr = ($800 x 365) / ($19,200 x n)\n\nr = 0.015625 / (n / 100)\n\nr = 1.5625 / n\n\nTo maximize the interest rate, we need to minimize n. The highest simple interest rate will be when n is the smallest possible value, which is 1 day.\n\nSubstituting n = 1, we get:\n\nr = 1.5625 / 1\n\nr = 1.5625 x 100\n\nr = 156.25%\n\nHowever, the interest rate cannot be more than 100%. Therefore, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 100%.\n\nAnswer: None of the above.",

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's denote the number of files infected only by a virus as V, the number of files infected only by a worm as W, and the number of files infected by both as B. We know that:\n\nV + W + B = 250 (since all 250 files are infected)\nW = 2.5B (since the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number infected by both)\nV = 0.5(250 - B) (since 50% of the files were not infected by a virus)\n\nWe want to find the number of files that were not infected by a worm, which is equal to V + B. Substituting the second and third equations into the first equation, we get:\n\n0.5(250 - B) + 2.5B + B = 250\nSimplifying and solving for B, we get:\n\n3.5B = 125\nB = 35.71 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSince B must be a whole number, we round up to B = 36. Substituting this value back into the second and third equations, we get:\n\nW = 2.5(36) = 90\nV = 0.5(250 - 36) = 107\n\nTherefore, the number of files that were not infected by a worm is V + B = 107 + 36 = 143.\n\nAnswer: None of the above.",

This means that out of every 18 parts of the alloy, 7 parts are zinc and 11 parts are copper.\n\nWhen 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are mixed, the total weight of the mixture is 40 + 60 = 100 grams.\n\nOut of these 100 grams, the weight of zinc in alloy X is (2/5) * 40 = 16 grams.\n\nSimilarly, the weight of zinc in alloy Y is (7/18) * 60 = 23.33 grams (approx).\n\nTherefore, the total weight of zinc in the mixture is 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams (approx).\n\nOut of these 100 grams, the weight of copper in alloy X is (3/5) * 40 = 24 grams.\n\nSimilarly, the weight of copper in alloy Y is (11/18) * 60 = 37.22 grams (approx).\n\nTherefore, the total weight of copper in the mixture is 24 + 37.22 = 61.22 grams (approx).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in the alloy Z is 39.33:61.22, which simplifies to 59:91.\n\nAnswer: Option D.

So, the volume of the coin is pi * (7.5 mm)^2 * 2 mm = 352.5 mm^3.\n\nLet x be the volume of aluminum in the coin. Since the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, the volume of silver in the coin is also x.
