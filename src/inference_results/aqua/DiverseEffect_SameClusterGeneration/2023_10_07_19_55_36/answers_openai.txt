        "prompt": "You are an expert at arithmetic reasoning and are willing to solve algebraic word problems. Select the correct answer from the given options. If none of the options are correct, generate 'None of the above'. To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\n\nQ: Two trains each 250 m in length are running on the same parallel lines in opposite directions with the speed of 80 kmph and 70 kmph respectively. In what time will they cross each other completely? Answer Choices: (A) 19 sec (B) 22 sec (C) 12 sec (D) 42 sec (E) 32 sec\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nExplanation:\nD = 250 m + 250 m = 500 m\nRS = 80 + 70 = 150 * 5/18 = 125/3\nT = 500 * 3/125 = 12 sec\nAnswer: Option C The answer is C.\n\nQ: A train is 320 meter long is running at a speed of 45 km/hour. In what time will it pass a bridge of 140 meter length? Answer Choices: (A) 11 seconds (B) 38 seconds (C) 40 seconds (D) 88 seconds (E) 36.8 seconds\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nSpeed = 45 Km/hr = 45*(5/18) m/sec = 25/2 m/sec\nTotal distance = 320+140 = 460 meter\nTime = Distance/speed\n= 460 * (2/25) = 36.8 seconds\nAnswer: E The answer is E.\n\nQ: Two trains travel in opposite directions at 36 kmph and 45 kmph and a man sitting in slower train passes the faster train in 4 seconds. The length of the faster train is Answer Choices: (A) 80 m (B) 100 m (C) 90 m (D) 180 m (E) None\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nSolution\nRelative Speed\t= (36 + 45) km/hr\n= (81 x 5/18) m/sec\n= (45/2) m/sec\nLength of the train\t= (45 / 2 x 4) m\n= 90 m.\nAnswer C The answer is C.\n\nQ: A train is 360 meter long is running at a speed of 50 km/hour. In what time will it pass a bridge of 140 meter length. Answer Choices: (A) 26 seconds (B) 36 seconds (C) 46 seconds (D) 56 seconds (E) None of these\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nExplanation:\nSpeed = 50 Km/hr = 50*(5/18) m/sec\n= 125/9 m/sec\nTotal distance = 360+140 = 500 meter\nTime = Distance/speed\n=500/125/9 = 36 seconds\nAnswer: B The answer is B.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
