Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A be E and A respectively.\nFrom the given data, we know that 1 gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.\nSo, 0.09E units of vitamin E and 0.08A units of vitamin A are present in 1 gram of the health food.\nTo obtain at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to eat x grams of the health food daily.\nSo, the total amount of vitamin E obtained from x grams of the health food = 0.09E \u00d7 x\nAnd, the total amount of vitamin A obtained from x grams of the health food = 0.08A \u00d7 x\nWe need to find the value of x such that both these amounts are at least equal to their respective minimum daily requirements.\nSo, we have the following two equations:\n0.09E \u00d7 x \u2265 E\n0.08A \u00d7 x \u2265 A\nDividing both sides of each equation by the respective coefficients of x, we get:\nx \u2265 E/0.09E\nx \u2265 A/0.08A\nSimplifying, we get:\nx \u2265 11.11\nx \u2265 12.5\nThe value of x should be such that it satisfies both these inequalities. So, the minimum value of x that satisfies both these inequalities is 12.5.\nTherefore, we need to eat 12.5 grams of the health food daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.\nAnswer: C The answer is C.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins.\nAccording to the problem, the total amount earned by the diver is $3.40.\nSo, we can write the equation as:\n0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40\nMultiplying both sides by 100, we get:\n20x + 25y = 340\nDividing both sides by 5, we get:\n4x + 5y = 68\nNow, we need to find the minimum number of copper coins that the diver brought. Since the diver earns less for copper coins than brass coins, we can assume that she brought the minimum number of copper coins possible. Let's assume that she brought only one copper coin. In that case, we can write the equation as:\n4(1) + 5y = 68\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n5y = 64\ny = 12.8\nSince the number of brass coins cannot be a fraction, we need to try another assumption.

Let's say he borrows $19,200 and pays it back after 30 days. The interest he will have to pay is the difference between the amount he borrowed and the amount he paid back, which is $800.\n\nLet's calculate the simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money:\n\nSimple Interest = (P * R * T)/100\n\nWhere P is the principal amount, R is the interest rate, and T is the time period.\n\nHere, P = $19,200, Simple Interest = $800, and T = 1 month = 1/12 year.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$800 = ($19,200 * R * 1/12)/100\n\nR = ($800 * 100 * 12)/$19,200\n\nR = 247.67\n\nTherefore, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 247.67%.\n\nAnswer: A The answer is A.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's first find out how many times the number of water lilies will double from 1 to cover the lake, and then use that information to find the answer for 64 water lilies.\n\nIf the number of water lilies doubles every two days, then after n days, the number of water lilies will be 2^n.\n\nWe know that it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies starting from 1 water lily. So we need to solve for n in the equation 2^n = (number of lilies on the lake)/(initial number of lilies) = 2^60.\n\n2^n = 2^60\nn = 60\n\nSo the number of times the number of water lilies doubles is 60/2 = 30.\n\nNow we can use this information to find the answer for 64 water lilies.

When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 50 (D) 55 (E) 58",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume Joe's age = J, Joe's sister's age = S, and Joe's father's age = F.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that:\n\nJ + S + F = 100\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that when Joe is as old as his father:\n\nJ + (t) = F + (t)  (where t is the number of years until Joe is as old as his father)\n\nAnd we also know that Joe's sister will be twice as old as now, which means:\n\nS + (t) = 2S\n\nSolving for S, we get:\n\nS = (1/2)t\n\nSubstituting this value of S in the first equation, we get:\n\nJ + (1/2)t + F = 100\n\nFrom the third statement, we know that when Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Let's assume that Joe's sister was as old as her father x years ago. This means that:\n\nS - x = F - x\n\nSolving for S, we get:\n\nS = F - x\n\nSubstituting this value of S in the equation S + (t) = 2S, we get:\n\nF - x + (t) = 2(F - x)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nF - x + t = 2F - 2x\n\nF + t - 2F = x - t\n\n-t + F = x - t\n\nF = x\n\nSo, we know that Joe's father was x years old when Joe's sister was as old as her father. We also know that when Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. This means that:\n\nF + t = 2(x)\n\nSubstituting F = x, we get:\n\nx + t = 2x\n\nt = x\n\nSo, we know that Joe's father was x years old when Joe's sister was as old as her father, and t = x. Substituting these values in the equation J + (1/2)t + F = 100, we get:\n\nJ + (1/2)x + x = 100\n\nJ + (3/2)x = 100\n\nJ = 100 - (3/2)x\n\nSubstituting this value of J in the equation J + (t) = F + (t), we get:\n\n100 - (3/2)x + (t) = F + (t)\n\nF = 100 - (3/2)x\n\nSo, the age of Joe's father is 100 - (3/2)x.\n\nWe need one more equation to solve for x. Let's use the fact that Joe's sister was as old as her father x years ago. This means that:\n\nS - x = F - x\n\nS = F\n\nSubstituting S = F in the equation J + S + F = 100, we get:\n\nJ + 2F = 100\n\nSubstituting J = 100 - (3/2)x and F = 100 - (3/2)x in this equation, we get:\n\n100 - (3/2)x + 2(100 - (3/2)x) = 100\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n200 - 6x = 100\n\n6x = 100\n\nx = 16.67\n\nSo, the age of Joe's father is:\n\n100 - (3/2)x = 100 - (3/2)(16.67) = 75\n\nAnswer: None of the above.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Explanation:\nLet's assume the length of the space shuttle is L meters.\nDuring the first 5 seconds, the shuttle covers a distance of 700m/40s * 5s = 87.5m.\nDuring the next 40 seconds, the shuttle covers a distance of 700m.\nDuring this time, the shuttle also covers its own length L.\nSo, the total distance covered by the shuttle in 45 seconds is 700m + L + 87.5m.\nWe know that the speed of the shuttle is constant, so we can use the formula:\nSpeed = Distance/Time\nSpeed = (700m + L + 87.5m)/45s\nSpeed = (787.5m + L)/45s\nWe also know that the speed of the shuttle is 700m/40s = 17.5m/s.\nSo, we can equate the two expressions for speed:\n(787.5m + L)/45s = 17.5m/s\nSolving for L, we get:\nL = 750m - 787.5m = 37.5m\nTherefore, the length of the space shuttle is 37.5 meters.\nAnswer: None of the above (since none of the answer choices match the correct answer of 37.5 meters).",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's first find the amount of zinc and copper in alloy X and Y separately.\n\nFor alloy X:\n- The ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3.\n- This means that for every 2 parts of zinc, there are 3 parts of copper.\n- So, the amount of zinc in 40 grams of alloy X is (2/5) * 40 = 16 grams.\n- And the amount of copper in 40 grams of alloy X is (3/5) * 40 = 24 grams.\n\nFor alloy Y:\n- The ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which does not simplify further.\n- So, the amount of zinc in 60 grams of alloy Y is (7/18) * 60 = 23.33 grams (rounded to 2 decimal places).\n- And the amount of copper in 60 grams of alloy Y is (11/18) * 60 = 36.67 grams (rounded to 2 decimal places).\n\nNow, let's find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z:\n- The total amount of zinc in alloy Z is 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams (rounded to 2 decimal places).\n- The total amount of copper in alloy Z is 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams (rounded to 2 decimal places).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 39.33:60.67, which simplifies to 59:91.\n\nAnswer: D The answer is D.",
