            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins.\nAccording to the problem, the total amount earned by the diver is $3.40 or 340 cents.\nSo, we can write the equation:\n20x + 25y = 340\nWe need to find the minimum number of copper coins, which means we need to minimize the value of x.\nLet's try to solve for x in terms of y:\n20x + 25y = 340\n20x = 340 - 25y\nx = (340 - 25y)/20\nFor x to be a minimum, y should be a maximum. Let's assume that the diver brought all brass coins, which means y is maximum and x is minimum.\nIf y = 13, then x = (340 - 25*13)/20 = 2.5\nSince x has to be a whole number, the minimum number of copper coins that the diver brought is 3.\nAnswer: (B) 3.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume the total number of students in the school to be x.\nAccording to the question, 20% of the students took physics and 28% of the students took math. This means that the number of students who took physics is 0.2x and the number of students who took math is 0.28x.\nNow, we know that the total number of students in the school is more than 501. So, we can write the inequality:\nx > 501\nWe need to find the least possible value of x that satisfies this inequality.\nLet's assume that all the students who took physics also took math. In this case, the total number of students who took physics or math is:\n0.2x + 0.28x - 0.2x = 0.28x\nWe know that this number is more than 501. So, we can write the inequality:\n0.28x > 501\nSolving for x, we get:\nx > 501/0.28\nx > 1793.75\nThe least possible value of x that satisfies this inequality is 1794.\nTherefore, the answer is (E) none of these.",

Let the speed of train M be S1 and the distance from A to X be D1. We know that train M starts at 5 am and reaches B at 9 am, which means it takes 4 hours to travel from A to B. Therefore, we have:\n\nD1 = S1 * 4\n\nNow, let's find the time taken by train N to travel from B to X. Let the speed of train N be S2 and the distance from B to X be D2. We know that train N starts at 7 am and reaches A at 10:30 am, which means it takes 3.5 hours to travel from B to A. Therefore, we have:\n\nD2 = S2 * 3.5\n\nSince the two trains meet at the same point X, we have:\n\nD1 + D2 = 4S1 = 3.5S2\n\nSubstituting D1 and D2 in the above equation, we get:\n\n4S1 + 3.5S2 = S1 * 4 + S2 * 3.5\n\n0.5S1 = 0.5S2\n\nS1 = S2\n\nThis means that the two trains are traveling at the same speed. Therefore, the point of intersection X is exactly halfway between A and B. Since train M starts at 5 am and takes 4 hours to reach B, it reaches X at 7 am. Similarly, train N starts at 7 am and takes 3.5 hours to reach A, it reaches X at 10:30 am. Therefore, the two trains cross each other at 7 am + 2.5 hours = 9:30 am.\n\nAnswer: None of the above.",

If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 50% (D) 65% (E) 75%",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the current population be P. \n\nAccording to the problem, the population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. \n\nSo, after one year, the population will be P + 0.1P = 1.1P. \n\nAfter two years, the population will be 1.1P + 0.1(1.1P) = 1.21P. \n\nThe problem states that this population is double the population of one year ago, which was P. \n\nSo, 1.21P = 2P, which means P = 0.605P. \n\nTherefore, the percent population increase over the last year is (0.605P - P)/P x 100% = -39.5%. \n\nHowever, since we are looking for the closest answer choice, the answer is (B) 40%.",

We can also rewrite the equation M - N + 396c = 990 as:\n\n100a + 10b + c - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n99a - 99c + 406c = 990\n99(a - c) = 990 - 406c\na - c = (990 - 406c)/99\n\nSince a > c, we know that (990 - 406c)/99 > 0. Solving for c, we get:\n\nc < 990/406\n\nc < 2.44\n\nSince c is a digit, the only possible value for c is 2. Therefore, a - c = (990 - 406c)/99 = 7. We also know that M > 300, so a must be either 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. For each of these values of a, we can solve for b and c using the equations:\n\nM = 100a + 10b + c\nN = 100c + 10b + a\n\nSince c = 2, we can simplify these equations to:\n\nM = 100a + 10b + 2\nN = 200 + 10b + a\n\nSolving for b in terms of a, we get:\n\nb = (N - a - 200)/10 = (100a - M - 198)/10\n\nUsing this equation, we can find the possible values of b for each value of a.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can use trigonometry to solve this problem. Let the height of the tower be h and the distance between the car and the base of the tower be x. Then, we have:\n\ntan(45) = h/x\ntan(60) = h/(x + d)\n\nwhere d is the distance the car travels in the additional time we are trying to find. We can simplify these equations to:\n\nx = h\nx + d = h/\u221a3\n\nWe can solve for h in the first equation and substitute into the second equation to get:\n\nx + d = x/\u221a3 + h/\u221a3\nd = (1/\u221a3 - 1)h\n\nNow, we need to find the time it takes for the car to travel this distance. We know that the car is traveling at a uniform speed, so we can use the formula:\n\ndistance = speed \u00d7 time\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for time:\n\ntime = distance / speed\n\nWe know the distance is d and we can find the speed by using the fact that the car takes 10 minutes (or 1/6 hours) to travel the distance x. Therefore, the speed is:\n\nspeed = x / (1/6) = 6x\n\nSubstituting in our values, we get:\n\ntime = d / (6x) = (1/6\u221a3 - 1/6)h / (6x)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\ntime = (\u221a3 - 1)/36 \u00d7 h/x\n\nSubstituting in x = h, we get:\n\ntime = (\u221a3 - 1)/36 \u00d7 1/tan(45)\n\ntan(45) = 1, so we have:\n\ntime = (\u221a3 - 1)/36\n\nThis is approximately 0.019 seconds, which is a very small amount of time. Therefore, we can conclude that the additional time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower is negligible compared to the 10 minutes it took for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0.\n\nAnswer: E None of these.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can solve this problem using the concept of Fibonacci numbers. Let F(n) be the number of ways to reach the nth step. To reach the nth step, the boy can either take one step from the (n-1)th step or two steps from the (n-2)th step. Therefore, F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2). We also know that F(1) = 1 and F(2) = 2 (since the boy can either take one step twice or take two steps once).\n\nUsing this recursive formula, we can calculate F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 2 + 1 = 3, F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 3 + 2 = 5, F(5) = F(4) + F(3) = 5 + 3 = 8, and so on.\n\nWe can continue this process until we reach F(10), which is the answer to the problem. Using the recursive formula, we get:\n\nF(10) = F(9) + F(8)\nF(9) = F(8) + F(7)\nF(8) = F(7) + F(6)\nF(7) = F(6) + F(5)\nF(6) = F(5) + F(4)\nF(5) = F(4) + F(3)\nF(4) = F(3) + F(2)\nF(3) = F(2) + F(1)\n\nUsing the initial values F(1) = 1 and F(2) = 2, we can calculate all the Fibonacci numbers up to F(10):\n\nF(1) = 1\nF(2) = 2\nF(3) = 3\nF(4) = 5\nF(5) = 8\nF(6) = 13\nF(7) = 21\nF(8) = 34\nF(9) = 55\nF(10) = 89\n\nTherefore, there are 89 ways for the boy to reach the top of the stairs.

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm.

We know that:\n\nV + W + B = 250 (since all 250 files are infected)\nW = 2.5B (since the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both)\n\nWe also know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so:\n\nV = 0.5(250) = 125\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n125 + W + B = 250\nW + B = 125\n\nSubstituting W = 2.5B, we get:\n\n2.5B + B = 125\n3.5B = 125\nB = 35.7 (rounded to the nearest whole number)\n\nSo there are 35 files infected by both a virus and a worm.
