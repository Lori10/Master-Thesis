If none of the options are correct, generate 'None of the above'. To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\n\nQ: If n denotes a number to the left of 0 on the number line such that the square of n is less than 1/25, then the reciprocal of n must be Answer Choices: (A) Less than -5 (B) Between -1 and -1/5 (C) Between -1/5 and 0 (D) Between 0 and 1/5 (E) Greater than 5\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nn^2 < 1/25\nabs(n) < 1/5\nSince n<0, then 0 > n > -1/5\n1/n < -5\nThe answer is A. The answer is A.\n\nQ: 80% of 5/8 = Answer Choices: (A) 0.2 (B) 0.5 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.75 (E) 1.0\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nShould be simple.\n0.8*5/8 = 4/8 = 1/2 = 0.5\nCorrect Option : B The answer is B.\n\nQ: The largest natural number which exactly divides the product of any four consecutive natural numbers is: Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 12 (C) 24 (D) 120 (E) 160\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nRequired number= 1*2*3*4=24\nAnswer: C The answer is C.\n\nQ: Pam and Cathy begin running at the same time on a straight path. Pam runs at 10 miles per hour, and Cathy runs at 8 miles per hour. After 45 minutes, Pam stops to stretch. If it takes Pam 30 minutes to stretch and Cathy continues to run during this time, how many minutes will it take Pam to catch up to Cathy assuming Pam resumes running at 10 miles per hour? Answer Choices: (A) 30 minutes (B) 40 minutes (C) 45 minutes (D) 60 minutes (E) 75 minutes\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nAfter 45 mins\nPam would have covered 45/60 * 10 mph = 7.5 miles\nCathy would have covered 45/60 * 8 mph = 6 miles\nPam does 30 minutes of stretching .. so after 75 mins\nPam would still be at 7.5 miles\nCathy would have covered 75/60 * 8 = 10 miles.\nSo after 75 mins Cathy is 2.5 miles ahead.\nANSWER:E The answer is E.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
