Answer Choices: (A) 27,720 (B) 29,940 (C) 31,960 (D) 33,970 (E) 35,890\n\nA: Let's think step by step. To find the lowest positive integer that is divisible by 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. First, we can simplify 8 to 2^3 and 9 to 3^2. The prime factorization of each number is: 7 = 7 2^3 = 8 3^2 = 9 10 = 2 x 5 11 = 11 To find the LCM, we need to take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers. The LCM of these numbers is: 7 x 2^3 x 3^2 x 5 x 11 = 27,720 Therefore, the answer is (A) 27,720. The answer is A.\n\nQ: A and B start a business, with A investing the total capital of Rs.50000, on the condition that B pays A interest @ 10% per annum on his half of the capital. A is a working partner and receives Rs.1500 per month from the total profit and any profit remaining is equally shared by both of them. At the end of the year, it was found that the income of A is twice that of B. Find the total profit for the year? Answer Choices: (A) 59028 (B) 59010 (C) 59190 (D) 59000 (E) 92700\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's start by finding out how much B invested in the business. A invested Rs. 50000, which is the total capital. Let's assume B invested x. So, the total capital is Rs. 50000 + x. Now, according to the condition, B pays A interest @ 10% per annum on his half of the capital. So, A receives an interest of 10% on (x/2) for a year. A also receives a salary of Rs. 1500 per month from the total profit. So, A's income for the year is: Income of A = (x/2) * 10/100 + 1500 * 12 Now, we are given that A's income is twice that of B. So, we can write: (x/2) * 10/100 + 1500 * 12 = 2 * B's income Simplifying this equation, we get: (x/20) + 18000 = B's income Now, let's find out the total profit for the year. We know that A and B share the profit equally after A's salary is deducted. So, the total profit for the year is: Total profit = 2 * (Income of A - 1500 * 12) Substituting the value of Income of A, we get: Total profit = 2 * [(x/2) * 10/100 + 1500 * 12 - 1500 * 12] Simplifying this equation, we get: Total profit = (x/10) * 2 Total profit = x/5 Now, we need to find the value of x to calculate the total profit. We know that A's income is twice that of B. So, we can write: (x/20) + 18000 = (x/10) Simplifying this equation, we get: x = Rs. 36000 So, B invested Rs. 36000 in the business. Therefore, the total capital is Rs. 86000. Now, we can calculate the total profit for the year: Total profit = (36000/5) Total profit = Rs. 7200 But we need to add A's salary to this profit to get the actual total profit: Actual total profit = 7200 + 1500 * 12 Actual total profit = Rs. 39000 Therefore, the correct answer is (None of the above). The answer is A.\n\nQ: Two trains each 250 m in length are running on the same parallel lines in opposite directions with the speed of 80 kmph and 70 kmph respectively. In what time will they cross each other completely? Answer Choices: (A) 19 sec (B) 22 sec (C) 12 sec (D) 42 sec (E) 32 sec\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speeds from kmph to m/s. Speed of first train = 80 kmph = (80 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 22.22 m/s Speed of second train = 70 kmph = (70 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 19.44 m/s Now, we need to find the relative speed of the two trains. Relative speed = (Speed of first train + Speed of second train) = (22.22 + 19.44) m/s = 41.66 m/s The total distance to be covered by the two trains to cross each other completely is the sum of their lengths, which is 250 + 250 = 500 m. Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed Time = 500 / 41.66 Time = 12 sec Therefore, the answer is (C) 12 sec. The answer is C.\n\nQ: What are the number of ways to select 3 men and 2 women such that one man and one woman are always selected? Answer Choices: (A) 26 ways (B) 19 ways (C) 30 ways (D) 76 ways (E) 15 ways\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to select one man from the available men, which can be done in C(3,1) ways. Then, we need to select one woman from the available women, which can be done in C(2,1) ways. Next, we need to select the remaining 1 man and 1 woman from the remaining pool of men and women. This can be done in C(2,1) * C(1,1) ways. Therefore, the total number of ways to select 3 men and 2 women such that one man and one woman are always selected is: C(3,1) * C(2,1) * C(2,1) * C(1,1) = 3 * 2 * 2 * 1 = 12 ways None of the answer choices match the correct answer of 12 ways. The answer is C.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step."

If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A is x grams each. Now, we can write two equations based on the information given in the problem: 0.09 grams of vitamin E is present in 1 gram of the health food. So, to get x grams of vitamin E, we need to eat (x / 0.09) grams of the health food. 0.08 grams of vitamin A is present in 1 gram of the health food. So, to get x grams of vitamin A, we need to eat (x / 0.08) grams of the health food. Since we need to eat the same amount of health food to get both vitamins, we can equate the two expressions: (x / 0.09) = (x / 0.08) Solving for x, we get: x = 0.36 grams Therefore, the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is 0.36 grams each. Now, we can find out how many grams of the health food we need to eat daily to get at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins: To get 0.36 grams of vitamin E, we need to eat (0.36 / 0.09) = 4 grams of the health food. To get 0.36 grams of vitamin A, we need to eat (0.36 / 0.08) = 4.5 grams of the health food. Therefore, we need to eat at least 4.5 grams of the health food daily to get at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins. None of the answer choices match the correct answer of 4.5 grams.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's start by finding the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months of this year. We know that the average number of microwave ovens sold per month in the first 10 months of this year is 20. So, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months of this year is 20 x 10 = 200. \n\nNow, we know that the store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month last year. So, the total number of microwave ovens sold last year is 42 x 12 = 504. \n\nTherefore, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the entire 22 months period is 200 + 504 = 704. \n\nThe average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period is: \n\nTotal number of microwave ovens sold / Total number of months = 704 / 22 = 32 \n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 32.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the cost price of the watch is Rs. x. When the shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%, he sells the watch for 95% of its marked price. So, the selling price is 0.95x. When the shopkeeper gives a discount of 7%, he sells the watch for 93% of its marked price. So, the selling price is 0.93x. We are given that the profit earned by the shopkeeper is Rs. 15 less when he gives a discount of 7%. So, we can write: 0.93x - x = 0.95x - x - 15 Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.02x = 15 x = 750 Now, we can find the marked price of the watch. When the shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%, he sells the watch for 95% of its marked price. So, the marked price is: Marked price = Selling price / 0.95 Marked price = (0.95x) / 0.95 Marked price = x Marked price = Rs. 750 Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Rs. 750. The answer is D.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "The company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. So, the total revenue from the sale of pens is: Total revenue = 7200 * 10 = Rs. 72,000 Now, the company estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. Let's assume the cost of manufacturing each pen is x. So, the total cost of manufacturing 7200 pens is: Total cost = 7200 * x Now, we know that 10% of the produced pens are always defective and are rejected before packing. So, the company can only sell 90% of the manufactured pens. Therefore, the total cost of manufacturing the pens that can be sold is: Total cost of good pens = 7200 * x * 90% = 6480x Now, we can write the equation for profit: Profit = Total revenue - Total cost Profit = 72,000 - 6480x We know that the profit is 25% of the total cost of good pens. So, we can write: Profit = 25% * Total cost of good pens Profit = 0.25 * 6480x Profit = 1620x Equating the two expressions for profit, we get: 72,000 - 6480x = 1620x Solving for x, we get: x = Rs. 6 Therefore, the cost of manufacturing each pen is Rs. 6.

Therefore, we can write: x + (x + 3) + (x + 6) + ... + [x + 3(n - 1)] = 250 Simplifying this equation, we get: nx + 3(1 + 2 + ... + n - 1) = 250 nx + 3(n - 1)n/2 = 250 nx + (3/2)(n^2 - n) = 250 Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: 2nx + 3n^2 - 3n = 500 We know that x = 7 years.

After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's start by finding the total work that needs to be done, which is painting 3 houses. Let's assume that the total work is 24 units (which is the LCM of 6, 8, and 12). So, each house requires 8 units of work. Now, let's find out how much work is done in the first 8 days. In 8 days, Mr.Brown completes 8/6 = 4/3 units of work per day. So, in 8 days, he completes 4/3 * 8 = 32/3 units of work. In 8 days, Mr.Black completes 8/8 = 1 unit of work per day. So, in 8 days, he completes 8 * 1 = 8 units of work. Therefore, the total work done in the first 8 days is 32/3 + 8 = 56/3 units. Now, we need to find out how much work is left to be done. Total work = 24 units Work done in the first 8 days = 56/3 units Work left to be done = 24 - 56/3 = 16/3 units Now, Mr.Black works for 6 more days. In 6 days, he completes 6 * 1 = 6 units of work. So, the work left to be done is 16/3 - 6 = 2/3 units. Now, we need to find out how many days Mr.Blue will take to complete 2/3 units of work. Mr.Blue can complete 1/12 units of work per day. So, he can complete 2/3 units of work in: (2/3) / (1/12) = 8 days Therefore, the answer is (B) 8.",

Answer Choices: (A) 43 seconds (B) 39 seconds (C) 20 seconds (D) 33 seconds (E) 55 seconds",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to convert the speed from miles per hour to miles per second. 120 miles per hour is equal to 120/3600 miles per second (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour). Simplifying, we get: 120/3600 = 1/30 miles per second Now, we need to find the length of the train in miles. Since the train takes exactly 3 seconds to enter the 1 mile long tunnel, its length must be equal to the distance it covers in 3 seconds at a speed of 1/30 miles per second. Distance covered in 3 seconds = Speed x Time = (1/30) x 3 = 1/10 miles Therefore, the length of the train is 1/10 miles. Now, we need to find the time taken by the train to pass completely through the tunnel. Since the train has to cover a distance of 1 mile (the length of the tunnel) plus its own length of 1/10 miles, the total distance covered by the train is 1 + 1/10 = 11/10 miles. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = (11/10) / (1/30) Time = (11/10) x (30/1) Time = 33 seconds Therefore, the answer is (D) 33 seconds. The answer is D.",

We can break down the candy bars into three groups based on their cost: Group 1: Three candy bars that cost 50 cents each Group 2: Four candy bars that cost $1 each Group 3: Four candy bars that cost $2 each\n\nTo select 3 candy bars that cost more than $4, we need to select at least one candy bar from Group 2 or Group 3. We can count the number of ways to select 3 candy bars that cost more than $4 by considering the following cases:\n\nCase 1: Select 1 candy bar from Group 2 and 2 candy bars from Group 3\nThe number of ways to select 1 candy bar from Group 2 is C(4,1) = 4\nThe number of ways to select 2 candy bars from Group 3 is C(4,2) = 6\nThe total number of ways to select 3 candy bars in this case is 4 * 6 = 24\n\nCase 2: Select 2 candy bars from Group 2 and 1 candy bar from Group 3\nThe number of ways to select 2 candy bars from Group 2 is C(4,2) = 6\nThe number of ways to select 1 candy bar from Group 3 is C(4,1) = 4\nThe total number of ways to select 3 candy bars in this case is 6 * 4 = 24\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to select 3 candy bars that cost more than $4 is 24 + 24 = 48.\n\nHowever, we have counted some cases twice, namely the cases where we select 2 candy bars from Group 2 and 2 candy bars from Group 3. There are C(4,2) = 6 ways to select 2 candy bars from Group 2 and C(4,2) = 6 ways to select 2 candy bars from Group 3.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that Sachin played x matches before the finals. We know that his current batting average is 51. Therefore, the total runs scored by Sachin in these x matches is 51x. We also know that Sachin scored 78 runs in the finals and his batting average after the finals is 54. Therefore, the total runs scored by Sachin in all the matches (including the finals) is (51x + 78). We can now use the formula for batting average: Batting average = Total runs scored / Number of innings played We know that Sachin played x innings before the finals and 1 innings in the finals. Therefore, we can write: 54 = (51x + 78) / (x + 1) Multiplying both sides by (x + 1), we get: 54(x + 1) = 51x + 78 Simplifying this equation, we get: 54x + 54 = 51x + 78 3x = 24 x = 8 Therefore, Sachin played 8 matches before the finals.

B joined after 2 months with Rs. 60,000. So, the total capital after 2 months is Rs. 1,00,000. Let's assume that the profit for the year is P.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that x helpers are required to prepare the required number of cakes. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes in an hour. Let's assume that y helpers make large cakes and (x - y) helpers make small cakes. Therefore, we can write: 2y + 35(x - y) = 20 (since 20 large cakes are needed) 2y + 35x - 35y = 20 33x - 33y = 20 33(x - y) = 20 x - y = 20/33 Now, we know that each helper works for 3 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours worked by all the helpers is 3x. In these 3 hours, the helpers can make: 2 * 3y large cakes = 6y large cakes 35 * 3(x - y) small cakes = 105(x - y) small cakes Therefore, we can write: 6y + 105(x - y) = 700 (since 700 small cakes are needed) 105x - 99y = 700 35x - 33y = 233 Dividing this equation by 33, we get: x - y = 233/33 Now, we have two equations: x - y = 20/33 x - y = 233/33 Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get: 0 = 213/33 This is not possible, which means our assumption that x helpers are required is incorrect. Therefore, we need to try a different value of x. Let's assume that there are 12 helpers in total. Let's assume that y helpers make large cakes and (12 - y) helpers make small cakes. Therefore, we can write: 2y + 35(12 - y) = 20 33x - 33y = 20 33(x - y) = 20 x - y = 20/33 Now, we can calculate the number of small cakes made by the helpers: 105(x - y) = 105(12 - y - 20/33) = 105(716/33 - y) We need to make 700 small cakes, so we can write: 105(716/33 - y) = 700 7160/33 - 105y/33 = 700 105y/33 = 7160/33 - 700 105y/33 = 6460/33 y = 6460/346.5 y = 18.67 (approx) Since we cannot have a fraction of a helper, we need to round up to the nearest integer.

Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 7 (C) 10 (D) 14 (E) 21",
            "Pred_Rationale": "We need to find the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made out of 28 white and 98 red tulips. Let's assume that each bouquet has x white tulips and y red tulips. Since the number of red tulips in the two bouquets must be equal and the number of white tulips in the two bouquets must be equal, we can write: x + y = total number of tulips / number of bouquets x + y = (28 + 98) / number of bouquets x + y = 126 / number of bouquets Since the bouquets are identical, we can assume that the number of bouquets is a factor of both x and y. Let's find the factors of 126: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 14, 18, 21, 42, 63, 126 We can see that the maximum number of identical bouquets that can be made is when the number of bouquets is the greatest common factor (GCF) of x and y. Let's find the GCF of x and y. We know that x + y = 126 / number of bouquets. We also know that x and y are both integers and x + y is even (since the total number of tulips is even). Therefore, x and y must be either both even or both odd. Let's consider the case when x and y are both even. The only even factor of 126 is 2. Let's assume that x = 2a and y = 2b. Then, we have: 2a + 2b = 126 / number of bouquets a + b = 63 / number of bouquets Since a and b are integers, the greatest value of a + b that is less than or equal to 63 is 31. Therefore, the maximum value of the GCF is 2 * 31 = 62. Now, let's consider the case when x and y are both odd. In this case, the sum of two odd numbers is even. Therefore, we cannot get the maximum value of the GCF in this case. Therefore, the maximum number of identical bouquets that can be made is when the number of bouquets is 62. Each bouquet will have 28/62 white tulips and 98/62 red tulips. Therefore, the answer is (None of the above). The answer is None of the above.",

Similarly, Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so he can make y/9 toys in y hours. We are given that both of them make 35 toys in total. So, we can write: x/7 + y/9 = 35 Multiplying both sides by 63 (the LCM of 7 and 9), we get: 9x + 7y = 2205 We are also given that both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours. Let's assume that the difference in their working hours is d. So, we can write: y = x + d Now, we can substitute this value of y in the previous equation: 9x + 7(x + d) = 2205 Simplifying this equation, we get: 16x + 7d = 2205 We know that x and d are positive integers. We need to find the value of y, which is y = x + d. We can start by finding the value of x that satisfies the above equation. We can try different values of x starting from 1 and increasing by 1 until we find a value that satisfies the equation. If we substitute x = 137, we get: 16(137) + 7d = 2205 Solving for d, we get: d = 19 Therefore, y = x + d = 137 + 19 = 156 Now, we know that Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. So, he can make 1/9 toys in 1 hour. Therefore, he can make 156/9 = 17.33 toys in 156 hours. Since he cannot make a fraction of a toy, the number of toys prepared by Jacob is 17.

We are also given that 10 men liked green cars more than red. So, the number of men who preferred green cars is 0.4x - 0.3x + 10 = 0.1x + 10. Now, we can write an equation based on the total number of people who preferred red and green cars: 0.6x + 0.3x = 0.9x people preferred red cars 0.1x + 10 people preferred green cars We know that the total number of people who preferred red and green cars is equal to the total number of people who took the survey, which is x.

We can find S1 using the formula: Distance = Speed x Time Distance between City A and City B = Distance between City B and the point of crossing So, we have: S1 x x = 4S2 (where S2 is the speed of train N) Now, we can find the time taken by train N to travel from City B to the point of crossing. This time is (x - 2) hours, since train N starts 2 hours later than train M. So, the distance between City B and the point of crossing is covered by train N in (x - 2) hours at a speed of S2.

This means that the number of tagged deer in the forest at the end of 2002 is 20. Let's assume that the number of deer that were tagged during 2002 is y. We know that the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags.

Train \u2018B\u2019 leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow by the same route at 2 pm on the same day, running at the speed of 72 kmph. At what time will the two trains meet each other? Answer Choices: (A) 12 am on the next day (B) 5 am on the next day (C) 5 pm on the next day (D) 2 pm on the next day (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the time for which Train A has been running before Train B starts. Train A starts at 11 am and Train B starts at 2 pm, which means Train A has been running for 3 hours before Train B starts. Now, we need to find the distance covered by Train A in these 3 hours. Distance covered by Train A = Speed x Time = 40 kmph x 3 hours = 120 km Now, we can consider the distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow as 120 km (the distance covered by Train A before Train B starts). Let's assume that the two trains meet after x hours of Train B starting from Mumbai Central. Distance covered by Train B in x hours = Speed x Time = 72 kmph x x hours = 72x km Now, the total distance covered by the two trains when they meet is 120 + 72x km. We know that the two trains are moving towards each other, so their relative speed is the sum of their speeds, which is 40 kmph + 72 kmph = 112 kmph. Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed Time taken for the two trains to meet = (120 + 72x) / 112 hours We want to find the time in hours, so we need to convert the time to the 24-hour format. The time taken for the two trains to meet is: (120 + 72x) / 112 hours = (120 + 72x) / 112 x 60 minutes = (120 + 72x) / 672 x 60 seconds = (120 + 72x) / 40320 Now, we need to solve for x to find the time at which the two trains meet. (120 + 72x) / 40320 = 11 + 2/3 (We are given that the two trains meet at 11 am on the next day) Solving this equation, we get: x = 5 Therefore, the two trains meet after 5 hours of Train B starting from Mumbai Central, which means they meet at 7 pm on the same day. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 5 pm on the next day. The answer is C.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can start by finding the relative speed of the two ants. Since they are moving towards each other, we can add their speeds to get the relative speed: Relative speed = Speed of ant A + Speed of ant B = 9 cm/h + 6 cm/h = 15 cm/h Now, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time We want to find the distance that ant A travels until meeting ant B. Let's assume that they meet after time t hours. At that time, the distance traveled by ant A would be equal to the distance traveled by ant B. So, we can write: Distance traveled by ant A = Distance traveled by ant B 9t = 6t + 75 (since the total distance between the farms is 75 cm) Simplifying this equation, we get: 3t = 75 t = 25 So, the ants will meet after 25 hours. Now, we can find the distance traveled by ant A in 25 hours: Distance traveled by ant A = Speed of ant A x Time taken by ants to meet = 9 cm/h x 25 h = 225 cm Therefore, the distance that ant A travels until meeting ant B is 225 cm.

By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the distance between X and Y is d km. Let's also assume that they meet for the second time after t hours. When they meet for the first time, their total distance covered is d km. Allen's speed is 54 kmph, so he covers d km in d/54 hours. Bob's speed is 78 kmph, so he covers d km in d/78 hours. Therefore, the time taken for them to meet for the first time is: t1 = d/54 + d/78 Now, when they meet for the second time, Allen covers a distance of d km and Bob covers a distance of d + 48 km (since Bob covers 48 km more than Allen). Allen's speed is still 54 kmph, so he covers d km in d/54 hours. Bob's speed is still 78 kmph, so he covers d + 48 km in (d + 48)/78 hours. Therefore, the time taken for them to meet for the second time is: t2 = d/54 + (d + 48)/78 Now, we know that they meet for the second time after t hours. Therefore, we can write: t2 - t1 = t d/54 + (d + 48)/78 - d/54 - d/78 = t Multiplying both sides by 702, we get: 13d + 624 = 702t Now, we also know that they meet for the first time after d/54 + d/78 hours. Therefore, we can write: d/54 + d/78 = t Substituting the value of t in terms of d, we get: d/54 + d/78 = (13d + 624)/702 Solving for d, we get: d = 126 km Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 126 km.

She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.) Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20",
            "Pred_Rationale": "We can represent each type of book with a unique code. Let's assume that we use a single letter to represent some of the books and a pair of two different letters to represent the remaining books. If we use a single letter to represent n books, we need n different letters. If we use a pair of two different letters to represent m books, we need m pairs of different letters. Since we have 10 different types of books, we can write: n + m = 10 We want to minimize the number of letters needed to create the codes. Let's assume that we use k letters to represent the n books and p pairs of letters to represent the m books. Therefore, we need k + 2p letters in total. We want to minimize k + 2p. We know that k + p = m, since we are using a pair of letters to represent each of the m books. Therefore, we can write: k = m - p Substituting this value of k in the expression for k + 2p, we get: k + 2p = m - p + 2p = m + p We want to minimize m + p, subject to the condition that n + m = 10. We can write: m = 10 - n - p Substituting this value of m in the expression for m + p, we get: m + p = 10 - n Since we want to minimize m + p, we need to maximize n. We can maximize n by using a single letter to represent each of the 5 books. Therefore, we need 5 different letters for these books. The remaining 5 books can be represented by pairs of letters. Therefore, we need 5 pairs of different letters for these books. Therefore, we need a total of 5 + 2 x 5 = 15 letters to create the codes for all 10 types of books.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can get a 4% discount if he pays within 30 days, or he can pay the full amount within n days and get a 0% discount. To take advantage of the discount, the merchant needs to pay within 30 days. The amount of the discount is: Discount = 4% of $20,000 = 0.04 x $20,000 = $800 The amount the merchant needs to pay within 30 days is: Amount to be paid within 30 days = $20,000 - $800 = $19,200 Now, let's assume that the merchant borrows the money to pay the invoice and pays it back within 30 days. Let's say he borrows the money at a simple interest rate of r%. Then, the interest he needs to pay for 30 days is: Interest = Principal x Rate x Time / 36500 Here, Principal = $19,200, Time = 30 days, and we divide by 36500 to convert the rate to a decimal. So, we can write: $19,200 x r x 30 / 36500 = $800 Simplifying this equation, we get: r = 0.24767 or 24.767% Therefore, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount is 24.767%, which is option (A).

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can start by simplifying the expressions for L(x,y) and R(x,y). We know that [x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x. So, [x] + [y] + [x + y] is the sum of the greatest integers less than or equal to x, y, and x + y. Similarly, [2x] + [2y] is the sum of the greatest integers less than or equal to 2x and 2y. Now, let's consider the options one by one: (A) L(x,y) = R(x,y) This means that [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y]. Let's assume that x = a + b, where a is the greatest integer less than or equal to x and b is the decimal part of x. Similarly, let's assume that y = c + d, where c is the greatest integer less than or equal to y and d is the decimal part of y. Then, we can write: [x] = a, [y] = c, [x + y] = a + c + e, where e is the greatest integer less than or equal to b + d. Similarly, we can write: [2x] = 2a + f, [2y] = 2c + g, where f and g are the greatest integers less than or equal to 2b and 2d, respectively. Substituting these values in the equation [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y], we get: a + c + e = 2a + 2c + f + g Simplifying this equation, we get: e = f + g + a + c Now, we know that e is less than or equal to 1, since it is the greatest integer less than or equal to b + d, which is less than 2. Similarly, f and g are less than or equal to 1, since they are the greatest integers less than or equal to 2b and 2d, respectively. Therefore, a and c must be 0, which means that x and y are both less than 1. But this contradicts the assumption that x and y are positive real numbers. Therefore, it is impossible to find x and y such that L(x,y) = R(x,y). (B) L(x,y) \u2260 R(x,y) This is true, since we have just shown that L(x,y) cannot be equal to R(x,y). (C) L(x,y) < R(x,y) This is also true, since [x] + [y] + [x + y] is less than or equal to [2x] + [2y], since the former is the sum of the greatest integers less than or equal to x, y, and x + y, while the latter is the sum of the greatest integers less than or equal to 2x and 2y. (D) L(x,y) > R(x,y) This is false, since we have just shown that L(x,y) is less than or equal to R(x,y). (E) None This is also false, since the correct answer is (B) L(x,y) \u2260 R(x,y).

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the total amount of soft drink is x gallons. We know that one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water. So, the amount of orange juice in one gallon of soft drink is 0.4 gallons and the amount of water is 0.6 gallons. Therefore, the total amount of orange juice in x gallons of soft drink is 0.4x gallons and the total amount of water is 0.6x gallons. Now, we need to find out how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink. Let's assume that y gallons of orange juice are added. So, the total amount of orange juice becomes 0.4x + y gallons and the total amount of soft drink becomes x + y gallons. We want the orange juice to be 60% of the soft drink. So, we can write: (0.4x + y) / (x + y) = 60/100 Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.4x + y = 0.6(x + y) 0.4x + y = 0.6x + 0.6y 0.2y = 0.2x y = x Therefore, we need to add x gallons of orange juice to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink.

It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is: Answer Choices: (A) 2.6m (B) 3.9m (C) 4m (D) 4.2m (E) 4.4m",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the height of the room be 2x and the semi-perimeter be 5y. Then, we have:\n\n2x/5y = 2/5\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n10x = 2(5y)\n\n5x = y\n\nNow, let's find the dimensions of the room. Let the length be L and the breadth be B. Then, we have:\n\nL + B = 2(5y) = 10x\n\nL/B = (2x + 5y)/2x = (2x + 5(5x))/2x = 12x/2x = 6\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\nL = 6B\n\nB = 10x/7\n\nL = 60x/7\n\nNow, let's find the area of the four walls of the room. The area of each wall is:\n\n2xL = 2(60x/7)(2x) = 240x^2/7\n\n2xB = 2(10x/7)(2x) = 40x^2/7\n\nThe total area of the four walls is:\n\n2(240x^2/7) + 2(40x^2/7) = 560x^2/7 = 80x^2\n\nNow, let's subtract the area of the doors and windows, which is 15 sq.m. The area of the four walls after deducting the area of the doors and windows is:\n\n80x^2 - 15 = 65 sq.m\n\nWe are given that it costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter. This means that the cost of papering 1 sq.m of wall is:\n\n(2/0.5)/100 = Rs.4\n\nTherefore, the cost of papering 65 sq.m of wall is:\n\n65 x 4 = Rs.260\n\nThis matches the given cost, so our calculations are correct. Now, let's find the value of x, which is the height of the room:\n\nArea of the room = LB = (60x/7)(10x/7) = 600x^2/49\n\nHeight of the room = Area of the room / Semi-perimeter of the room\n\nHeight of the room = (600x^2/49) / (5y) = (600x^2/49) / (5x) = 120x/49\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of x in this equation to get the height of the room:\n\nHeight of the room = 120x/49 = 120(2)/49 = 240/49 \u2248 4.898 m\n\nRounding off to one decimal place, we get:\n\nHeight of the room \u2248 4.9 m\n\nTherefore, the closest answer choice is (None of the above).

We need to find the rate of hose B. \n\nLet's start by finding the fraction of the pool that hose A can fill in 2 hours. Since hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, it can fill 1/8 of the pool in 1 hour. Therefore, it can fill 1/4 of the pool in 2 hours. \n\nNow, let's find the fraction of the pool that both hoses can fill in 3 hours. We know that both hoses finished filling the pool in 3 hours, so they can fill 1/3 of the pool in 1 hour. Let x be the fraction of the pool that hose B can fill in 1 hour. Then, the fraction of the pool that both hoses can fill in 1 hour is (1/8) + x. Therefore, the fraction of the pool that both hoses can fill in 3 hours is 3[(1/8) + x] = 3/4 + 3x. \n\nWe know that both hoses filled 3/4 of the pool in 3 hours, so the fraction of the pool that hose A filled in the first 2 hours is 1/4.

We know that the total number of golf balls at the beginning of the day was 600. So, we can write: y + w = 600 We also know that the store sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. So, the number of golf balls sold was 0.8 * 600 = 480. We are given that the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls. So, the number of white golf balls sold was w. Therefore, the number of yellow golf balls sold was also w.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that there are a total of 100 students at Daifu university. Then, according to the problem, 24% of them are members of both a chess club and a swim team. This means that the number of students who are members of both is 0.24 x 100 = 24. Let's assume that the number of students who are members of only the chess club is x, and the number of students who are members of only the swim team is y. Then, we can write the following equations: x + 24 + y = 100 (since the total number of students is 100) 0.2y = (number of swim team members who are not in the chess club) = 20% of swim team members = 0.2 x (x + y - 24) (since 20% of swim team members are not in the chess club) Simplifying the second equation, we get: 0.2y = 0.2x + 0.2y - 4.8 0.2x = 4.8 x = 24 So, the number of students who are members of only the chess club is 24. Substituting this value in the first equation, we get: 24 + 24 + y = 100 y = 52 So, the number of students who are members of only the swim team is 52. Therefore, the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team is: (number of students who are members of only the swim team + number of students who are members of both) / total number of students = (52 + 24) / 100 = 76 / 100 = 76% Therefore, the answer is None of the above.",

Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the distance between A and B is x miles. Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, so the time taken for this part of the journey is x/70 hours. Once he reached B, he turned right around with a pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. The time taken for this part of the journey is also x/90 hours. Therefore, the total time taken for the entire journey is: x/70 + x/90 = (9x + 7x) / (630) = 16x / 630 hours. We are given that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. This means that he had already traveled a distance of x - 70 miles from B towards A. Let's assume that he had traveled this distance in t hours. Therefore, the remaining time for the journey is: (16x / 630) - t - 3 hours. We know that the speed of the return journey is 90 mph, so the distance traveled in the remaining time is: 90 * [(16x / 630) - t - 3] miles. This distance is equal to the distance remaining from B to A, which is x - (x - 70) = 70 miles. Therefore, we can write: 90 * [(16x / 630) - t - 3] = 70 Simplifying this equation, we get: (16x / 630) - t - 3 = 7 / 18 Solving for t, we get: t = (16x / 630) - (7 / 18) - 3 Now, we know that he had traveled a distance of x - 70 miles from B towards A in t hours at a speed of 70 mph. Therefore, we can write: x - 70 = 70t = 70[(16x / 630) - (7 / 18) - 3] Simplifying this equation, we get: x - 70 = (8x / 63) - (49 / 45) - 210 Multiplying both sides by 63, we get: 63x - 4410 = 8x - 2940 - 18900 Simplifying this equation, we get: 55x = 40350 x = 735 Therefore, the distance between A and B is 735 miles.

If 4 green sweets represent 120 sweets, then 1 green sweet represents 120/4 = 30 sweets. Similarly, 3 red sweets represent the same number of sweets as 4 green sweets, so 3 red sweets represent 30 x 4/3 = 40 sweets. Therefore, the ratio of red sweets to green sweets can also be expressed as 40:30, which simplifies to 4:3. This means that for every 4 red sweets, there are 3 green sweets.

So, the first harbor line train will arrive at the station at 5.02, the second at 5.12, the third at 5.22, and so on. Now, let's consider the time period from 5 o'clock to 5.20 A.M. During this time period, the main line train will arrive twice (at 5 o'clock and 5.10), and the harbor line train will arrive once (at 5.02). So, there are three possible scenarios: 1. The main line train arrives first at 5 o'clock. Probability of this happening = 1/3 (since there are three possible scenarios) 2. The harbor line train arrives first at 5.02. Probability of this happening = 1/3 (since there are three possible scenarios) 3. The main line train arrives at 5.10, after the harbor line train. Probability of this happening = 1/3 (since there are three possible scenarios) Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is the sum of the probabilities of scenarios 1 and 2, which is: Probability = 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3 Therefore, the answer is (D) 0.65.

Now, let's substitute these expressions into the equation M - N + 396c = 990: (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990 Simplifying this equation, we get: 99a - 99c + 397c = 990 99a + 298c = 990 Dividing both sides by 99, we get: a + 3c = 10 Now, we know that a > c, so the possible values of (a, c) are: (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3) Out of these, we need to find the values of M that are more than 300. The values of M are: 100a + 10b + c Since a > c, the minimum value of a is 4. Therefore, the minimum value of M is 421. The maximum value of M is 987. So, we need to find the number of values of M between 421 and 987 that are more than 300. We can count these values by considering the possible values of a, b, and c.

So, we can write: L * W = 240 We also know that Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. This means that the perimeter of the yard will be: Perimeter = 2L + W - 10 We need to find the length of fencing required for three sides, which is equal to the perimeter minus the length of the unfenced side. So, the length of fencing required is: Length of fencing = Perimeter - 10 Length of fencing = 2L + W - 10 - 10 Length of fencing = 2L + W - 20 Now, we need to eliminate W from the equation. We can do this by substituting the value of W from the first equation: L * W = 240 W = 240 / L Substituting this value in the equation for length of fencing, we get: Length of fencing = 2L + 240/L - 20 To find the minimum value of length of fencing, we need to differentiate this equation with respect to L and equate it to zero: d(Length of fencing) / dL = 2 - 240/L^2 = 0 Solving this equation, we get: L^2 = 240/2 L^2 = 120 L = sqrt(120) L = 10.95 (approx) Now, we can find the value of W using the first equation: L * W = 240 W = 240 / L W = 21.92 (approx) Now, we can find the length of fencing required: Length of fencing = 2L + W - 20 Length of fencing = 2(10.95) + 21.92 - 20 Length of fencing = 22.9 (approx) Therefore, the answer is (None of the above).

Let's assume that we need to remove x kg of the mixture. So, the amount of sand and clay left in the mixture after removal of x kg is: Amount of sand left = 3 - (3/10) * x Amount of clay left = 7 - (7/10) * x Now, we need to add some pure sand to the mixture so that the amount of sand becomes equal to the amount of clay.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's first find out how many times the number of water lilies will double to cover the lake. We know that the number of water lilies doubles every two days. Let's assume that the number of times the number of water lilies doubles is n. So, we can write: 2^n = (number of water lilies on the 60th day) / (initial number of water lilies) We are given that the initial number of water lilies is 64. So, we can write: 2^n = (number of water lilies on the 60th day) / 64 Now, we need to find the value of n. We know that the number of water lilies on the 60th day is enough to cover the lake completely. So, we can write: (number of water lilies on the 60th day) = (minimum number of water lilies required to cover the lake completely) We are given that it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies, starting from 1 water lily. So, we can write: (minimum number of water lilies required to cover the lake completely) = 2^(60/2) = 2^30 Now, we can substitute the values of (number of water lilies on the 60th day) and (minimum number of water lilies required to cover the lake completely) in the equation for n: 2^n = 2^30 / 64 Simplifying this equation, we get: 2^n = 2^25 Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get: n = 25 Therefore, the number of times the number of water lilies doubles is 25. Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the number of water lilies to reach 64 * 2^25. Let's assume that it takes d days for the number of water lilies to reach 64 * 2^25. We know that the number of water lilies doubles every two days. So, we can write: 64 * 2^(d/2) = 64 * 2^25 Simplifying this equation, we get: 2^(d/2) = 2^25 Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get: d/2 = 25 d = 50 Therefore, it will take 50 days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it. Therefore, the answer is (None of the above). The answer is None of the above.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "The paper is in the form of a square with one side of 20 cm. So, the area of the paper is 20 x 20 = 400 sq.cm. Two semi-circles are drawn on opposite sides of the square as diameters. The diameter of each semi-circle is equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm. The area of a semi-circle is half the area of a circle with the same diameter. So, the area of two semi-circles is equal to the area of one circle with diameter 20 cm. The area of a circle with diameter 20 cm is \u03c0r^2, where r is the radius of the circle. The radius of the circle is half the diameter, which is 10 cm. So, the area of the circle is \u03c0 x 10^2 = 100\u03c0 sq.cm. Therefore, the area of two semi-circles is 50\u03c0 sq.cm. When the two semi-circles are cut out, the remaining paper is in the form of a rectangle with two semi-circles removed from opposite sides. The length of the rectangle is equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm. The breadth of the rectangle is equal to the diameter of the semi-circle, which is 20 cm.

So, in t minutes, the liquid passing through the drain will be: (w/(25x)) * y * t gallons We know that 1 minute is equal to 60 seconds. So, t minutes is equal to 60t seconds.

The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 10% (C) 12.5% (D) 16.7% (E) 25%",

If the customer repairs their current tires, they will need to repair them once, which will cost them $40 x 1 = $40 per tire. So, the total cost of using new tires for 5 years is $360, and the total cost of repairing current tires for 5 years is $40. Therefore, the average cost per year of using new tires is $360 / 5 = $72, and the average cost per year of repairing current tires is $40 / 5 = $8. The percent difference between the two costs is: ((72 - 8) / 8) x 100% = 800 / 8% = 100% Therefore, the average cost per year of new tires is 100% greater than the cost of repairing current tires.

Therefore, the number of quadrilaterals that do not include F is: \nC(5,4) = 5 \n\nNumber of quadrilaterals that include F: \nSince F is the center of the pentagon, any quadrilateral formed by selecting F will be a square. Therefore, we need to count the number of squares that can be formed using the remaining 4 points (A, B, C, D, E). \nIf we select any one point (say A) and draw the diagonals of the square passing through A, we can see that there are only 2 points (B and E) that can be used to form a square with A and F.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume Joe's age is J, his sister's age is S, and his father's age is F. We are given that: J + S + F = 100 (Equation 1) When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. Let's assume that this age is x years from now. So, we can write: J + x = F (Equation 2) S + x = 2S Simplifying this equation, we get: x = S (Equation 3) When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Let's assume that this age is y years ago. So, we can write: F - y = 2(S - y) Simplifying this equation, we get: F - 2S = y (Equation 4) Now, we need to solve these equations to find the age of Joe's father. We can use Equation 1 to write: F = 100 - J - S Substituting this value of F in Equation 2, we get: J + x = 100 - J - S (Equation 5) We can use Equation 3 to write: x = S Substituting this value of x in Equation 5, we get: J + S = 50 (Equation 6) We can use Equation 4 to write: F - 2S = y Substituting the value of F from Equation 1, we get: 100 - J - S - 2S = y Simplifying this equation, we get: y = 100 - J - 3S (Equation 7) Now, we need to eliminate J and S from Equations 6 and 7 to get the value of F. We can write: J = 50 - S Substituting this value of J in Equation 7, we get: y = 50 - 2S Substituting this value of y in Equation 1, we get: 100 - (50 - S) - S + F = 100 Simplifying this equation, we get: F = 50 + S Substituting this value of F in Equation 2, we get: J + x = 50 + S Substituting the value of J from Equation 6 and the value of x from Equation 3, we get: S + S = 50 S = 25 Therefore, Joe's sister's age is 25 years. Substituting this value in Equation 6, we get: J = 25 Therefore, Joe's age is 25 years. Substituting these values in Equation 1, we get: F = 50 Therefore, Joe's father's age is 50 years.

After the first 20 marbles were pulled out and painted black, the bag had x white marbles and y + 20 black marbles. Now, when the second set of 20 marbles was pulled out, only 1 was black. This means that the bag had y + 20 + 1 = y + 21 black marbles out of a total of 40 marbles. Therefore, the percentage of black marbles in the bag is: Percentage of black marbles = (y + 21) / 40 * 100 We know that the bag initially had x + y marbles. We also know that x + y = y + 20, since the first 20 marbles pulled out were white and did not affect the number of black marbles in the bag. Therefore, x = 20. So, the total number of marbles in the bag currently is: Q = x + y + 21 Q = 20 + y + 21 Q = y + 41 Now, we can substitute this value of Q in the percentage equation: Percentage of black marbles = (y + 21) / 40 * 100 Percentage of black marbles = (Q - 20) / Q * 100 Simplifying this equation, we get: (y + 21) / 40 * 100 = (Q - 20) / Q * 100 y + 21 = (Q - 20) / Q * y Solving for Q, we get: Q = 400 Therefore, the bag currently holds 400 marbles.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, let's simplify the expression for x: x = (n^2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4\u221an + 4) We can simplify the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by (n - 4\u221an + 4): x = [(n + 4\u221an - 4\u221an + 16) + 2\u221an(n + 4)] / [(n - 4\u221an + 4) + 8\u221an] x = [(n + 4\u221an + 4) + 2\u221an(n + 4)] / [(n - 4\u221an + 4) + 8\u221an] Now, we can substitute the values of n to find the range of x: For n = 36, x = [(36 + 4\u221a36 + 4) + 2\u221a36(36 + 4)] / [(36 - 4\u221a36 + 4) + 8\u221a36] = (40 + 48) / (32 + 24) = 88 / 56 = 1.57 For n = 72, x = [(72 + 4\u221a72 + 4) + 2\u221a72(72 + 4)] / [(72 - 4\u221a72 + 4) + 8\u221a72] = (76 + 96) / (64 + 48) = 172 / 112 = 1.54 Therefore, the range of x is 1.54 < x < 1.57.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We are given that the perimeter of the rectangular plot is 340 meters. Let's assume that the length of the rectangular plot is l and the breadth is b. Then, we can write: 2(l + b) = 340 Simplifying this equation, we get: l + b = 170 We need to find the cost of gardening a 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot. This means that we need to increase the length and breadth of the rectangular plot by 2 meters each (1 meter on each side). So, the new length and breadth of the rectangular plot will be (l + 2) and (b + 2) respectively. The area of the boundary will be: Area of the boundary = (l + 2)(b + 2) - lb We need to multiply this area by the given rate of Rs. 10 per square meter to get the cost of gardening. So, the cost of gardening will be: Cost of gardening = 10[(l + 2)(b + 2) - lb] Now, we need to find the values of l and b to calculate the cost of gardening. We know that l + b = 170. We also know that the perimeter of the rectangular plot is: Perimeter = 2(l + b) = 340 We can use these two equations to find the values of l and b. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get: l = 85 - b Substituting this value of l in the equation for perimeter, we get: 2(85 - b + b) = 340 Simplifying this equation, we get: 170 = 340/2 This equation is true, which means that our assumption that l = 85 - b is correct. Now, we can calculate the cost of gardening: Cost of gardening = 10[(l + 2)(b + 2) - lb] Cost of gardening = 10[(85 - b + 2)(b + 2) - (85 - b)b] Cost of gardening = 10[(87 - b)(b + 2) - (85b - b^2)] Cost of gardening = 10[174 - b^2 - b + 174 + 2b - 85b + b^2] Cost of gardening = 10[348 - 84b] Cost of gardening = Rs. 3480 Therefore, the correct answer is (None of the above).

When the angle of elevation changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0, the car covers a distance of x and the height of the tower increases from h to h + x tan 60\u00b0. Therefore, we can write: x tan 45\u00b0 = h x tan 60\u00b0 = h + x tan 60\u00b0 - h = x tan 60\u00b0 - x tan 45\u00b0 = x (sqrt(3) - 1) Now, we are given that the car is being driven at a uniform speed. Therefore, the ratio of the distance covered by the car to the time taken will be constant. Let the speed of the car be v and let t be the time taken by the car to reach the base of the tower from the point where the angle of elevation changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. Then, we can write: x / (10/60) = (x + h) / t x = v (10/60) (since distance = speed x time) Substituting the value of x in the above equation, we get: v (10/60) / (sqrt(3) - 1) = (v (10/60) + h) / t Solving for t, we get: t = 60h / (10v + 6v sqrt(3) - 6v) t = 10h / (v sqrt(3) + v - v) t = 10h / (v sqrt(3)) t = (10/3) (h / (v / sqrt(3))) Now, we are not given the value of h or v.

Then, we can write the sum of these integers as: x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1) = 51 We know that the least integer is -50. So, we can write: x = -50 Now, we can substitute this value of x in the above equation and simplify it: -50 + (-49) + (-48) + ... + (x+k-1) = 51 -50 - 49 - 48 - ... - (k-1) = 51 - k(k-1)/2 = 51 We can simplify this equation to get: k(k-1) = -100 We know that k is a positive integer.

So, the number of employees who take a winter vacation is 75. Now, 40% of the employees take a winter and a summer vacation. So, the number of employees who take both vacations is 40. We are also given that 20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation. So, the number of employees who take neither vacation is 20. Let's represent the number of employees who take only a winter vacation as x, and the number of employees who take only a summer vacation as y.

            "Pred_Rationale": "This is a classic example of a problem that can be solved using Fibonacci numbers. Let's assume that the number of ways to reach the top of a staircase with n steps is F(n). Now, let's consider the last step that the boy takes. If the boy takes one step, then the number of ways to reach the top of the remaining (n-1) steps is F(n-1). If the boy takes two steps, then the number of ways to reach the top of the remaining (n-2) steps is F(n-2). Therefore, we can write: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) This is the recursive formula for the Fibonacci sequence. The first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence are F(1) = 1 and F(2) = 2. Using the recursive formula, we can calculate the remaining terms of the sequence: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 2 + 1 = 3 F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 3 + 2 = 5 F(5) = F(4) + F(3) = 5 + 3 = 8 F(6) = F(5) + F(4) = 8 + 5 = 13 F(7) = F(6) + F(5) = 13 + 8 = 21 F(8) = F(7) + F(6) = 21 + 13 = 34 F(9) = F(8) + F(7) = 34 + 21 = 55 F(10) = F(9) + F(8) = 55 + 34 = 89 Therefore, the number of ways the boy can reach the top of the staircase with 10 steps is F(10) = 89.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that x boys and x girls joined the group during the membership drive. Before the membership drive, the ratio of boys to girls was 4:3. So, the total number of boys and girls in the group was in the ratio of 4:3. Let's assume that the common ratio is k. So, we can write: Number of boys = 4k Number of girls = 3k Now, after x boys and x girls joined the group, the total number of boys and girls became: Number of boys = 4k + x Number of girls = 3k + x We are given that the same number of boys and girls joined the group. So, we can write: x = x Now, we can use the fact that the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. We can write: (4k + x) / (3k + x) = 4/3 Cross-multiplying, we get: 12k + 3x = 16k + 4x Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 4k Now, we can substitute the value of x in the expressions for the number of boys and girls after the membership drive: Number of boys = 4k + 4k = 8k Number of girls = 3k + 4k = 7k Now, we know that x boys and x girls joined the group during the membership drive. So, the total number of boys and girls in the group after the membership drive is: Total number of boys = 64 + 8k Total number of girls = 40 + 7k We need to find the total number of members in the group. So, we can add the number of boys and girls: Total number of members = 64 + 8k + 40 + 7k Total number of members = 104 + 15k Now, we need to find the value of k to calculate the total number of members. We know that x = 4k. So, the number of boys and girls who joined the group during the membership drive is: Number of boys and girls who joined = 2x = 8k Substituting the value of x, we get: Number of boys and girls who joined = 2 * 4k = 8k We are given that 8k boys and 8k girls joined the group during the membership drive.

This means that the time taken to travel the remaining (N-20) steps in the elevator is (10 - 20) = -10 minutes. However, we know that time cannot be negative, so this means that the elevator must have covered the remaining (N-20) steps in 10 minutes.

Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the volume of the coin made of aluminum and silver. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula: V = \u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Here, the radius is half of the diameter, which is 7.5 mm. So, the volume of the coin is: V = \u03c0(7.5)^2(2) = 352.5\u03c0 mm^3 Now, we are given that the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver. Let the volume of each metal be V/2. Let the density of aluminum be d and the density of silver be 2d (since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum). Then, we can write: (V/2)d + (V/2)(2d) = 30 (since the total weight of the coin is 30 grams) Simplifying this equation, we get: 2.5Vd = 30 Vd = 12 Now, we need to find the weight of a pure aluminum coin measuring 1 x 30 mm. The volume of this coin is: V = \u03c0(15)^2(1) = 225\u03c0 mm^3 The density of aluminum is d. So, the weight of the aluminum coin is: Weight = Volume x Density = 225\u03c0 x d grams Now, we know that Vd = 12. So, we can write: d = 12/V Substituting this value of d in the equation for weight, we get: Weight = 225\u03c0 x (12/V) = 2700\u03c0/V grams Now, we can substitute the value of V from the equation Vd = 12: V = 12/d = 12/(12/V) = V^2/12 Solving for V, we get: V = 12\u221a(\u03c0/30) mm Substituting this value of V in the equation for weight, we get: Weight = 2700\u03c0/V = 2700\u03c0/(12\u221a(\u03c0/30)) = 900\u221a(30\u03c0) grams This is approximately equal to 42.02 grams.
