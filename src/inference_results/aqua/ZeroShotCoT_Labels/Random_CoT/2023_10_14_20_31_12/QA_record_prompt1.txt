Answer Choices: (A) 25 (B) 66 (C) 288 (D) 29 (E) 17\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 9.6 kg to grams: 9.6 kg = 9.6 x 1000 g = 9600 g Now we can set up the proportion: 28 g / 9600 g = x / 100 Solving for x: x = (28 x 100) / 9600 x = 0.29 So the answer is approximately 29%. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 29. The answer is D.\n\nQ: By weight, liquid X makes up 0.5 percent of solution P and 1.5 percent of solution Q. If 200 grams of solution P are mixed with 800 grams of solution Q, then liquid X accounts for what percent of the weight of the resulting solution? Answer Choices: (A) 1.3% (B) 1.2% (C) 1.1% (D) 1.0% (E) 0.9%\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much liquid X is in 200 grams of solution P and 800 grams of solution Q. Liquid X in 200 grams of solution P = 0.5% of 200 grams = 1 gram Liquid X in 800 grams of solution Q = 1.5% of 800 grams = 12 grams Total liquid X in the resulting solution = 1 gram + 12 grams = 13 grams Now, we need to find out what percent of the weight of the resulting solution is 13 grams. Total weight of resulting solution = 200 grams + 800 grams = 1000 grams Percent of liquid X in the resulting solution = (13 grams / 1000 grams) x 100% = 1.3% Therefore, the answer is (A) 1.3%. The answer is A.\n\nQ: The largest natural number which exactly divides the product of any four consecutive natural numbers is: Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 12 (C) 24 (D) 120 (E) 160\n\nA: Let's think step by step. We can start by assuming four consecutive natural numbers as n, n+1, n+2, and n+3. The product of these four numbers would be: n x (n+1) x (n+2) x (n+3) = n(n+3) x (n+1)(n+2) = (n^2 + 3n) x (n^2 + 3n + 2) = n^4 + 6n^3 + 11n^2 + 6n Now, we need to find the largest natural number that exactly divides this expression. We can see that 2 and 3 both divide the expression. To check if any larger number divides the expression, we can try to factorize it. n^4 + 6n^3 + 11n^2 + 6n = n(n^3 + 6n^2 + 11n + 6) = n(n+1)(n^2 + 5n + 6) = n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3) So, the largest natural number that exactly divides the product of any four consecutive natural numbers is the product of the four consecutive numbers divided by their LCM. LCM of (n, n+1, n+2, n+3) = (n+3) if n is not divisible by 3, otherwise LCM = 3(n+3). Therefore, the largest natural number that exactly divides the product of any four consecutive natural numbers is 3 x (n+3) if n is divisible by 3, otherwise it is (n+3). Looking at the answer choices, we can see that (C) 24 is the correct answer. The answer is C.\n\nQ: If a man can cover 12 metres in one second, how many kilometres can he cover in 3 hours 45 minutes? Answer Choices: (A) 288 (B) 162 (C) 878 (D) 168 (E) 122\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 3 hours 45 minutes into seconds. 3 hours = 3 x 60 x 60 = 10,800 seconds 45 minutes = 45 x 60 = 2,700 seconds Total time = 10,800 + 2,700 = 13,500 seconds Now, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time The man's speed is 12 metres per second. So, distance covered in 13,500 seconds = 12 x 13,500 = 162,000 metres We need to convert this to kilometres: 1 kilometre = 1000 metres So, distance covered in 3 hours 45 minutes = 162,000/1000 = 162 kilometres Therefore, the answer is (B) 162. The answer is B.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step."

This is just an assumption and does not affect the final answer. \n\nP can eat 1 unit of candies in 10 minutes, so he can eat 1/10 units of candies in 1 minute. \n\nQ can eat half the jar (5 units) in 5 minutes, so she can eat 1 unit of candies in 5/5 = 1 minute.

On a particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work. So, he cleans 8 units of the yacht (2/3 x 12). The remaining portion of the work is 4 units of the yacht. Now, we need to find out how long it takes Jill to clean 4 units of the yacht. We know that Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. So, Jill can clean 5% of 1 unit of the yacht in 1 hour, which is 1/20th of a unit in 1 hour. To clean 4 units of the yacht, Jill will take: 4 / (1/20) = 80 hours Therefore, the answer is (D) 50.

We know that the profit earned by the shopkeeper is the difference between the selling price and the cost price. Let the cost price of the watch be c. So, the profit earned after giving a discount of 5% is 0.95x - c. The profit earned after giving a discount of 7% is 0.93x - c - 15. We can set up an equation using these two expressions: 0.95x - c = 0.93x - c - 15 Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.02x = 15 x = 750 Therefore, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750.

Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. So, the total revenue from the sale of pens would be: 7200 x Rs. 10 = Rs. 72,000\n\nThe company estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. So, the total profit would be: 25% of total cost = 25/100 x total cost\n\nLet's assume that the total cost of manufacturing all the pens is C. Then, the total profit would be: 25/100 x C\n\nNow, we need to find the total cost of manufacturing all the pens. We know that 10% of the produced pens are always defective and are rejected before packing. So, the company needs to produce extra pens to compensate for the defective ones.\n\nLet's assume that the company produces x number of pens to get 7200 good pens after rejecting 10% of them. Then, we can set up the following equation:\n\n0.9x = 7200\nx = 8000\n\nSo, the company needs to produce 8000 pens to get 7200 good pens after rejecting 10% of them.\n\nNow, we can find the total cost of manufacturing all the pens:\n\nC = cost of producing 8000 pens + cost of producing extra pens to compensate for the defective ones\n\nLet's assume that the cost of producing one pen is Rs. y. Then, the cost of producing 8000 pens would be: 8000 x Rs. y = Rs. 8000y\n\nThe company needs to produce extra pens to compensate for the defective ones. We know that 10% of the produced pens are always defective. So, the company needs to produce extra 10% pens. The total number of pens produced would be:\n\n8000 + 10% of 8000 = 8800\n\nThe cost of producing extra 10% pens would be: 10% of 8000 x Rs. y = Rs. 800y\n\nSo, the total cost of manufacturing all the pens would be:\n\nC = Rs. 8000y + Rs. 800y = Rs. 8800y\n\nNow, we can find the value of y:\n\nTotal revenue = Total cost + Total profit\nRs. 72,000 = Rs. 8800y + 25/100 x Rs. 8800y\nRs. 72,000 = Rs. 11000y\ny = Rs. 6.55 (approx.)\n\nTherefore, the manufactured cost of each pen is approximately Rs. 6.55.

            "Pred_Rationale": "If the manufacturer is offering a 20% discount, then the customer has to pay only 80% of the original price. Let's say the original price of the tyre is $100. After the manufacturer's discount, the price becomes $80. Now, if the retailer offers an additional 20% discount, then the customer has to pay only 80% of $80, which is: 80% of $80 = (80/100) x $80 = $64 So, the total discount available at that retailer is: $100 - $64 = $36 The percentage discount is: ($36/$100) x 100% = 36% Therefore, the answer is (E) 36%.

            "Question": "Q: A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the combined rate of painting of all three workers. Let's assume that the total work is painting three houses. Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so his rate of painting is 1/6 houses per day. Similarly, Mr. Black's rate of painting is 1/8 houses per day, and Mr. Blue's rate of painting is 1/12 houses per day. Therefore, the combined rate of painting of all three workers is:\n\n1/6 + 1/8 + 1/12 = 2/8 + 3/24 + 2/24 = 7/24 houses per day\n\nNow, let's find out how much work is done in the first 8 days. Mr. Brown works for 8 days, so he completes 8 x (1/6) = 4/3 houses of work. Mr. Black works for 6 days after that, so he completes 6 x (1/8) = 3/4 houses of work. Therefore, the total work done in the first 8 days is:\n\n4/3 + 3/4 = 16/12 + 9/12 = 25/12 houses of work\n\nNow, we need to find out how much work is left to be done. The total work is 3 houses, so the work left to be done is:\n\n3 - 25/12 = 11/12 houses of work\n\nFinally, we can find out how many days Mr. Blue will take to complete this work. His rate of painting is 1/12 houses per day, so the number of days he will take is:\n\n(11/12) / (1/12) = 11 days\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 11. The answer is D.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that C joined the business after x months since A started the business. So, A invested for 12 months, B invested for (12-2) = 10 months, and C invested for (12-x) months. \n\nNow, we can use the formula: Profit = (Investment x Time x Rate)/100 \n\nLet's assume that the rate of profit is R%. \n\nSo, we can write the following equations: \n\nA's profit = (40000 x 12 x R)/100 \nB's profit = (60000 x 10 x R)/100 \nC's profit = (120000 x (12-x) x R)/100 \n\nWe know that the total profit is Rs.375,000 and C's share is Rs.150,000. So, we can write: \n\nA's profit + B's profit + C's profit = 375000 \nC's profit = 150000 \n\nSubstituting the values, we get: \n\n(40000 x 12 x R)/100 + (60000 x 10 x R)/100 + (120000 x (12-x) x R)/100 = 375000 \n(48000R + 60000R + 144000R - 12000Rx)/100 = 375000 \n120000R - 12000Rx = 37500000 \n\nDividing both sides by 12000, we get: \n\n10R - Rx = 3125 \n\nWe know that C's profit is Rs.150,000.

We can set up an equation based on the time it takes for each of them to make a toy: \n\nx/7 + (35 - x)/9 = T \n\nwhere T is the total time they worked in hours. \n\nWe know that both of them worked for almost similar number of hours, so we can assume that T is approximately the same for both of them. \n\nMultiplying both sides by the LCM of 7 and 9, which is 63, we get: \n\n9x + 7(35 - x) = 63T \n\nSimplifying the equation, we get: \n\n2x = 28 + 56T \n\nx = 14 + 28T \n\nSince x represents the number of toys made by Alex, we know that (35 - x) represents the number of toys made by Jacob. \n\nSubstituting x = 14 + 28T, we get: \n\n35 - x = 21 - 28T \n\nSo, Jacob made 21 - 28T toys. \n\nWe know that both of them made a total of 35 toys, so: \n\nx + (35 - x) = 35 \n\n14 + 28T + 21 - 28T = 35 \n\n35 = 35 \n\nThis equation is always true, which means that our assumption that T is approximately the same for both of them is correct. \n\nNow, we need to find the value of T that satisfies the condition that both of them worked for almost similar number of hours. \n\nLet's assume that T is 1 hour.

Let's assume there are n family members. If we arrange their incomes in increasing order, then the median income would be the (n+1)/2-th income. Since the median income is $3000, we can write: (n+1)/2-th income = $3000 Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: (n+1)-th income = $6000 Now, we know that the total income of the family is $9000. So, we can write: 1st income + 2nd income + ... + (n-1)-th income + (n)-th income = $9000 We also know that the (n+1)-th income is $6000. Since there are n family members, the average income would be $9000/n.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet are l and b respectively. When folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm. This means that the length of each part is (48/2) - b = 24 - b. Similarly, the breadth of each part is (48/2) - l = 24 - l. So, we can write: 2(24 - b) + 2l = 48 Simplifying this equation, we get: l + b = 24 When folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm. This means that the length of each part is (66/2) - b = 33 - b. Similarly, the breadth of each part is (66/2) - l = 33 - l. So, we can write: 2(33 - b) + 2l = 66 Simplifying this equation, we get: l + b = 33 Adding the two equations, we get: 2l + 2b = 57 or l + b = 28.5 Now, we can solve for l and b: l + b = 28.5 l + b = 24 Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get: l = 4.5 and b = 19.5 Therefore, the area of the rectangular sheet is l x b = 4.5 x 19.5 = 87.75 square cm.

If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's start by finding the number of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year. We know that 20 deer out of 500 caught had tags from the previous year. So, the percentage of deer with tags in the 500 deer sample is (20/500) x 100% = 4%. We are given that this percentage is representative of the percentage of the total deer population in the forest with tags. Let the total deer population in the forest be x. Then, the number of deer with tags in the forest is 4% of x, which is 0.04x. We also know that 300 deer were tagged in 2001. So, the total number of deer with tags in the forest is 300 + 0.04x. We can set up an equation using this information: 300 + 0.04x = number of deer with tags in 2002 We can also set up an equation for the total number of deer caught in 2002: 500 = number of deer with tags in 2002 + number of deer without tags in 2002 We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get: 500 = 300 + 0.04x + number of deer without tags in 2002 Simplifying this equation, we get: number of deer without tags in 2002 = 200 + 0.96x We know that the total number of deer in the forest is the sum of the number of deer with tags and the number of deer without tags. So, we can set up another equation: x = number of deer with tags in 2002 + number of deer without tags in 2002 Substituting the expressions we found earlier, we get: x = 300 + 0.04x + 200 + 0.96x Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.92x = 5000 x = 5000/0.92 = 5434.78 (rounded to the nearest whole number) Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is approximately 5435.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find out how much time Train A has been traveling before Train B starts. Train A starts at 11 am and Train B starts at 2 pm, which means Train A has been traveling for 3 hours. In these 3 hours, Train A covers a distance of 40 x 3 = 120 km. Now, we can set up the equation: Distance covered by Train A + Distance covered by Train B = Total distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow Let's assume that the two trains meet after t hours of Train B's journey. Distance covered by Train A = 120 + 40t Distance covered by Train B = 72t Total distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow = Distance covered by Train A + Distance covered by Train B = 120 + 40t + 72t = 120 + 112t Now, we can solve for t: 120 + 112t = Total distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow Total distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow = 1385 km (approx.) 112t = 1385 - 120 t = 1265/112 t = 11.3 hours Therefore, the two trains will meet after 11.3 hours of Train B's journey, which means they will meet at 2 pm + 11.3 hours = 1:18 am on the next day.

If we use a pair of two different letters, we can represent up to 26 x 25 / 2 = 325 types of books (since the order of letters in a pair does not matter). Since we have only 10 types of books, we can use a combination of single letter codes and pair of two different letters codes. We want to minimize the number of letters we use. Let's start by using single letter codes for the first 9 types of books.

Five dozen toys are packed in a box, so 1 box contains: 5 x 12 = 60 toys Now, we need to find out how many toys are there in 98 boxes: 98 boxes x 60 toys per box = 5,880 toys Now, we need to find out how many tempos are required to lift 29,400 toys. Let's assume the number of tempos required is x. Then, we can set up the proportion: 5,880 toys / 98 tempos = 29,400 toys / x tempos Solving for x: x = (29,400 x 98) / 5,880 x = 490 Therefore, 490 tempos are required to lift 29,400 toys in one round. However, the answer choices do not include 490, so we need to divide 490 by 10 to get the answer in tens of tempos: 490 / 10 = 49 So, the answer is (E) 8, which is the closest option to 49.

If d = 2 and e = 7, then we get:\n\n10^4a + 10^3b + 10^2c + 58 = 150000\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n10^4a + 10^3b + 10^2c = 149942\n\nWe can see that the left-hand side is divisible by 2 and 5, so the right-hand side must also be divisible by 2 and 5. Therefore, c must be 2 or 7. If c = 2, then we get:\n\n10^4a + 10^3b + 2200 = 149942\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n10^4a + 10^3b = 147742\n\nWe can see that the left-hand side is divisible by 10, so the right-hand side must also be divisible by 10. Therefore, b must be even. The only possible values for b are 4 and 6, in some order. If b = 4, then we get:\n\n10^4a + 4000 = 147742\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n10^4a = 143742\n\nTherefore, a = 4. So, the 5-digit number is 43,742. Checking, we can see that 43,7421 is three times as large as 143,742:\n\n43,7421 = 3(143,742)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 42857. The answer is A.",

It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is: Answer Choices: (A) 2.6m (B) 3.9m (C) 4m (D) 4.2m (E) 4.4m",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the height of the room be 2x and the semi-perimeter be 5y. Then, we have:\n\n2x/5y = 2/5\n=> x/y = 1/5\n\nLet the length, breadth, and height of the room be L, B, and 2x, respectively. Then, we have:\n\n2L + 2B = 5y\n=> L + B = (5/2)y\n\nThe area of the four walls of the room is:\n\n2xL + 2x B = 2x(L + B) = 2x(5/2)y = 5xy\n\nThe cost of papering the walls is Rs.260, which is the product of the length of paper used and the cost per meter. The length of paper used is the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height of the room. The perimeter of the room is:\n\n2(L + B) = 2(5/2)y = 5y\n\nThe length of paper used is:\n\n5y x 2x = 10xy\n\nThe area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m. The area of the four walls is 5xy. Therefore, the area of the walls after deducting the area of the doors and windows is:\n\n5xy - 15\n\nThe length of paper used for this area is:\n\n(5xy - 15) x 2x = 10xy - 30x\n\nThe cost of this paper is:\n\n(10xy - 30x) x 2/100 = (xy - 3x)/5\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n(xy - 3x)/5 = 260\n=> xy - 3x = 1300\n=> x(y - 3) = 1300\n=> x = 1300/(y - 3)\n\nSubstituting this value of x in the equation x/y = 1/5, we get:\n\n1300/(y - 3)y = 1/5\n=> 5y - 15 = 1300/y\n=> 5y^2 - 15y - 1300 = 0\n=> y^2 - 3y - 260 = 0\n=> (y - 20)(y + 13) = 0\n\nSince y is the semi-perimeter of the room, it must be positive. Therefore, we have:\n\ny = 20\n\nSubstituting this value of y in the equation L + B = (5/2)y, we get:\n\nL + B = 50\n\nThe area of the four walls is:\n\n5xy = 5x(20) = 100x\n\nThe area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m. Therefore, the area of the walls after deducting the area of the doors and windows is:\n\n100x - 15\n\nThe length of paper used for this area is:\n\n(100x - 15) x 2x = 200x^2 - 30x\n\nThe cost of this paper is:\n\n(200x^2 - 30x) x 2/100 = 4x^2 - 3x\n\nSubstituting the value of x in terms of y, we get:\n\nx = 1300/(y - 3) = 1300/17\n\nTherefore, the height of the room is:\n\n2x = 2600/17 = 152.94 cm = 1.5294 m (approx.)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (None of the above).",

So, the total number of newspapers bought in a week is: 2x + 7x = 9x The cost of buying these newspapers is $4 for each Sunday newspaper and $1 for each weekday newspaper. So, the total cost is: 4(2x) + 1(7x) = 15x The problem tells us that the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers. So, we can set up an equation: 15x = 210 Solving for x: x = 14 So, the hotel buys 14 newspapers on each weekday and 2 x 14 = 28 newspapers on Sunday.

We know that the store sold 80% of its inventory, so it sold 0.8(600) = 480 golf balls. Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, we know that the number of white golf balls sold is w. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, we know that the number of yellow golf balls sold is also w. Therefore, the total number of golf balls sold is w + w = 2w. We can set up an equation to represent this: 2w = 480 Solving for w: w = 240 Since the store had y yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day, we know that the total number of golf balls was y + 240. We also know that the total number of golf balls was 600.

Let's call the number of students who are only members of the swim team \"x\". Then, the number of students who are members of the swim team (including those who are also members of the chess club) is (x + 24). \n\nWe know that 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we can assign variables to the cost of one soda and one energy bar. Let's say the cost of one soda is x cents and the cost of one energy bar is y cents. Then, we can set up two equations based on the given information:\n\n1x + 2y = 150 (equation 1)\n2x + 3y = 300 (equation 2)\n\nWe want to find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars. Using the variables we assigned, the cost of six sodas would be 6x cents and the cost of seven energy bars would be 7y cents. So, we want to find the value of 6x + 7y.\n\nTo solve for x and y, we can use elimination. Multiplying equation 1 by 2 and subtracting it from equation 2, we get:\n\n2x + 3y - 2(1x + 2y) = 300 - 2(150)\nx - y = 0\n\nSo, we know that x = y. Substituting this into either equation 1 or 2, we can solve for x or y:\n\n1x + 2y = 150\n1x + 2x = 150\n3x = 150\nx = 50\n\nSo, the cost of one soda is 50 cents. Substituting this into equation 1, we can solve for y:\n\n1x + 2y = 150\n1(50) + 2y = 150\n2y = 100\ny = 50\n\nSo, the cost of one energy bar is also 50 cents.\n\nNow, we can find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars:\n\n6x + 7y = 6(50) + 7(50) = 300 + 350 = 650\n\nTherefore, the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars is 650.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The first train that comes can be either from the main line or the harbor line. \n\nThe main line train starts at 5 o'clock and has a frequency of 10 minutes. So, the first train from the main line can come at 5 o'clock, 5.10 A.M., 5.20 A.M., and so on. \n\nThe harbor line train starts at 5.02 A.M. and has a frequency of 10 minutes. So, the first train from the harbor line can come at 5.02 A.M., 5.12 A.M., 5.22 A.M., and so on. \n\nTo calculate the probability of the man catching the first train, we need to find out the time interval during which the first train from either line can come. \n\nThe first train from the main line can come anytime between 5 o'clock and 5.10 A.M. \n\nThe first train from the harbor line can come anytime between 5.02 A.M. and 5.12 A.M. \n\nSo, the time interval during which the first train can come is from 5 o'clock to 5.12 A.M. \n\nThe total time interval between 5 o'clock and 5.12 A.M. is 12 minutes. \n\nThe frequency of both trains is 10 minutes.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the length of the rectangular yard is L and the width is W. We know that the area of the yard is 240 square meters, so we can write:\n\nL x W = 240\n\nWe also know that Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. This means that the perimeter of the yard will be:\n\nP = 2L + W - 10\n\nWe need to find the length of fencing required for three sides, which is:\n\nFencing = 2L + W - 10 + 2W + 2L\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nFencing = 4L + 3W - 10\n\nNow, we need to eliminate one of the variables (L or W) from these two equations. We can do this by solving the first equation for L:\n\nL = 240/W\n\nSubstituting this value of L in the expression for fencing, we get:\n\nFencing = 4(240/W) + 3W - 10\n\nTo find the value of W that minimizes the length of fencing, we can take the derivative of this expression with respect to W and set it equal to zero:\n\ndFencing/dW = -960/W^2 + 3 = 0\n\nSolving for W, we get:\n\nW = sqrt(960/3) = 16\n\nSubstituting this value of W in the expression for L, we get:\n\nL = 240/16 = 15\n\nTherefore, the length of fencing required is:\n\nFencing = 4L + 3W - 10 = 4(15) + 3(16) - 10 = 70\n\nSo, Alice needs 70 meters of fencing.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the speed of the ship is x miles per hour. The plane's speed is 10 times the speed of the ship, so its speed is 10x miles per hour. Let's also assume that they meet after t hours. \n\nIn that time, the ship travels a distance of 180 miles (given in the problem). The plane travels a distance of 10x * t miles. \n\nWhen they meet, the total distance traveled by both the ship and the plane is the distance from the starting point to the point where they meet. Let's call this distance d. \n\nSo, we can set up an equation: \n\n180 + 10x * t = d \n\nWe also know that the ship and the plane cover the same distance, so we can set up another equation: \n\nx * t = (d - 180) \n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (t and d).

After the second 20 marbles were pulled out, there was 1 black marble among them. So, the total number of black marbles in the bag became (W + 1). We can set up the equation: (W + 1) / Q = 1/20 where Q is the total number of marbles in the bag currently. Solving for Q: Q = 20(W + 1) Q = 20W + 20 Total number of marbles in the bag = 20 + (20 - W) + (W + 1) = 41 So, we have Q = 20W + 20 = 41 Q = 21 + 20W We know that Q is a multiple of 41.

So, the cost of gardening the 1-metre broad boundary will be (2L + 2B + 4) x 10 = 20L + 20B + 40. We know that L + B = 170. So, we can write this expression as 20L + 20B + 40 = 20(L + B) + 40 = 20 x 170 + 40 = 3440. Therefore, the answer is (C) 3440. The answer is C.",

Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. Then, according to the problem:\n\n- 75 employees take a winter vacation (75% of 100).\n- 40 employees take both a winter and a summer vacation.\n- 20 employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation.\n\nWe can use this information to find the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. Let's call this number \"x\". Then:\n\n- The total number of employees who take a summer vacation is the same as the number of employees who take a winter or a summer vacation. This is equal to the number of employees who take a winter vacation (75) plus the number of employees who take both a winter and a summer vacation (40), minus the number of employees who take neither vacation (20). So, the total number of employees who take a summer vacation is 75 + 40 - 20 = 95.\n- The number of employees who take both a winter and a summer vacation (40) is equal to the number of employees who take a winter vacation (75) times the percentage of those who take both vacations. So, we can write:\n\n40 = 75 \u00d7 0.4\n\nSolving for the percentage of employees who take both vacations, we get:\n\n0.4 = 40/75 = 0.5333... = 53.33...%\n\n- The number of employees who take only a winter vacation is equal to the number of employees who take a winter vacation minus the number of employees who take both vacations. So, we can write:\n\n75 - 40 = 35\n\n- The number of employees who take only a summer vacation is equal to the total number of employees who take a summer vacation minus the number of employees who take both vacations. So, we can write:\n\nx = 95 - 40 = 55\n\nTherefore, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is:\n\nx/100 = 55/100 = 0.55 = 55%\n\nSo, the answer is not one of the answer choices.

This means that the number of files infected by a virus is 50% of 250, or 125.

Therefore, the group now has 64 + 32 = 96 boys and 40 + 32 = 72 girls. The total number of members in the group is 96 + 72 = 168. Therefore, the answer is (E) 168. The answer is E.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the speed of the space shuttle. The height it travels in 40 seconds is 700m, so its speed is 700/40 = 17.5 m/s. \n\nNext, we need to find the distance it travels during the 5 seconds it takes to pass a point. Its speed during this time is the same, so the distance it travels is 17.5 x 5 = 87.5 m. \n\nFinally, we can find the length of the space shuttle by adding the distance it travels during the 5 seconds to the length of time it takes to travel 700m at 17.5 m/s. \n\nThe time it takes to travel 700m at 17.5 m/s is 700/17.5 = 40 seconds. \n\nSo the total length of the space shuttle is 87.5 + 40 = 127.5 m. \n\nTherefore, the answer is not one of the given choices.

Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the amount of zinc and copper in 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y. \n\nFor alloy X: \n- The ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. \n- So, the amount of zinc in 40 grams of alloy X is (2/5) x 40 = 16 grams. \n- And the amount of copper in 40 grams of alloy X is (3/5) x 40 = 24 grams. \n\nFor alloy Y: \n- The ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which does not simplify. \n- So, we need to find a common multiple of 7 and 11, which is 77. \n- This means that for every 7 grams of alloy Y, there are 11 grams of copper. \n- So, the amount of zinc in 60 grams of alloy Y is (7/18) x 60 = 23.33 grams (rounded to two decimal places). \n- And the amount of copper in 60 grams of alloy Y is (11/18) x 60 = 36.67 grams (rounded to two decimal places). \n\nNow, we can find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z: \n- Total amount of zinc = 16 grams + 23.33 grams = 39.33 grams \n- Total amount of copper = 24 grams + 36.67 grams = 60.67 grams \n\nFinally, we can simplify the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z: \n- Divide both amounts by the smaller value (which is 39.33 grams): \n    - Zinc: 39.33 grams \u00f7 39.33 grams = 1 \n    - Copper: 60.67 grams \u00f7 39.33 grams \u2248 1.54 \n- Round the ratio to the nearest whole number: \n    - Zinc: 1 \n    - Copper: 2 \n- So, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 1:2. \n\nTherefore, the answer is None of the above.",

We know that the area of the rectangular piece is 150 sq m. So, we can set up the equation: x(4x + 1) = 150 Simplifying this equation, we get: 4x^2 + x - 150 = 0 We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula: x = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a where a = 4, b = 1, and c = -150. x = (-1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 2400)) / 8 x = (-1 \u00b1 49) / 8 We can ignore the negative value of x. So, x = 6.

Let's also assume that the speed of the elevator is 's' steps/minute. \n\nAccording to the problem, if you walk 20 steps and stop, you reach the bottom in 10 minutes. This means that the elevator covers (n-20) steps in 10 minutes. So, the speed of the elevator can be calculated as:\n\ns = (n-20)/10\n\nSimilarly, if you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach the ground in 20 minutes.

Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the volume of the coin made of alloy. Volume of the coin = \u03c0r^2h = \u03c0(7.5)^2(2) = 352.5\u03c0 mm^3 Since the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, the volume of each metal is half of the total volume of the coin. So, the volume of aluminum in the coin = 176.25\u03c0 mm^3 The density of aluminum is 2.7 g/cm^3. Since the coin is 2 mm thick, we can assume that its density is also 2.7 g/cm^3. So, the mass of aluminum in the coin = (176.25\u03c0 x 2.7) / 1000 = 1.50675 grams The mass of silver in the coin = 30 - 1.50675 = 28.49325 grams Now, we need to find the weight of a pure aluminum coin measuring 1 x 30 mm. The volume of this coin = \u03c0r^2h = \u03c0(15)^2(1) = 225\u03c0 mm^3 The density of aluminum is 2.7 g/cm^3. Since the coin is 1 mm thick, we can assume that its density is also 2.7 g/cm^3. So, the mass of the pure aluminum coin = (225\u03c0 x 2.7) / 1000 = 1.91625 grams Therefore, the weight of the pure aluminum coin = 1.91625 x 10 = 19.1625 grams (since 1 kg = 1000 grams) Now, we need to find the weight of the pure aluminum coin if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum. Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of the pure aluminum coin would be half the weight of the coin made of alloy. So, the weight of the pure aluminum coin = 30 / 2 = 15 grams Therefore, the weight of the pure aluminum coin measuring 1 x 30 mm is (D) 48 grams. The answer is D.",
