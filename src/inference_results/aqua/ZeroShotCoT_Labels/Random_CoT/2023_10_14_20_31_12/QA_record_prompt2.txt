Answer Choices: (A) 50% (B) 100% (C) 150% (D) 200% (E) 250%\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the cost price of the item is $100. If the selling price is quadrupled, the new selling price would be $400. Let's say the profit made at the original selling price was $x. If the profit is pentadrupled, the new profit would be $5x. Profit = Selling price - Cost price So, x = Selling price - $100 $5x = $400 - $100 $5x = $300 x = $60 Therefore, the original profit was $60 and the new profit is $300. Percentage increase in profit = (New profit - Original profit) / Original profit * 100 = (300 - 60) / 60 * 100 = 400% So, the answer is (D) 200%. The answer is D.\n\nQ: There are two examinations rooms A and B. If 10 students are sent from A to B, then the number of students in each room is the same. If 20 candidates are sent from B to A, then the number of students in A is double the number of students in B. The number of students in room A is: Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 110 (C) 120 (D) 130 (E) 140\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the initial number of students in room A is \"x\" and in room B is \"y\". According to the first condition, if 10 students are sent from A to B, then the number of students in each room is the same. So, after the transfer, the number of students in each room will be (x-10) and (y+10). According to the second condition, if 20 candidates are sent from B to A, then the number of students in A is double the number of students in B. So, after the transfer, the number of students in each room will be (x+20) and (y-20/2) = (y-10). Now, we can equate both expressions for the number of students in room B: y+10 = y-10/2 Solving for y, we get: y = 30 Substituting this value in the expression for the number of students in room A, we get: x+20 = 2(y-10) x+20 = 2(30-10) x+20 = 40 x = 20 Therefore, the number of students in room A is 20+20 = 40. None of the above answer choices are correct. The answer is A.\n\nQ: A vendor buys 10 t-shirts at an average price of $14 per t-shirt. He then buys 15 more t-shirts at an average price of $11 per t-shirt. What is the average price D per t-shirt that the vendor paid for these purchases? Answer Choices: (A) $12.20 (B) $12.50 (C) $12.55 (D) $12.70 (E) $13.00\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total cost of the first purchase of 10 t-shirts. Total cost of 10 t-shirts = 10 x $14 = $140 Step 2: Find the total cost of the second purchase of 15 t-shirts. Total cost of 15 t-shirts = 15 x $11 = $165 Step 3: Find the total cost of both purchases. Total cost of both purchases = $140 + $165 = $305 Step 4: Find the total number of t-shirts purchased. Total number of t-shirts = 10 + 15 = 25 Step 5: Find the average price per t-shirt. Average price per t-shirt = Total cost of both purchases / Total number of t-shirts D = $305 / 25 = $12.20 Therefore, the answer is (A) $12.20. The answer is A.\n\nQ: Let f(x,y) be defined as the remainder when (x\u2013y)! is divided by x. If x=16, what is the maximum value of y for which f(x,y)=0? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 10 (C) 15 (D) 20 (E) 25\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the value of (x-y)!. Since x=16, we have (16-y)!. Next, we need to find the remainder when (16-y)! is divided by 16. This means we need to find the largest value of y such that (16-y)! is divisible by 16. We know that 16=2^4, so we need to find the largest power of 2 that divides (16-y)!. We can use the formula for the highest power of a prime p that divides n!, which is given by: \u230an/p\u230b + \u230an/p^2\u230b + \u230an/p^3\u230b + ... where \u230ax\u230b denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. In this case, p=2 and n=16-y, so we have: \u230a(16-y)/2\u230b + \u230a(16-y)/4\u230b + \u230a(16-y)/8\u230b + \u230a(16-y)/16\u230b Simplifying this expression, we get: 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15 So the largest power of 2 that divides (16-y)! is 2^15. Therefore, the maximum value of y for which f(x,y)=0 is 15. The answer is (C) 15. The answer is C.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step."

Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A is 100% each. This means that we need to consume 100/9 = 11.11 grams of the health food to get 100% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E, and 100/8 = 12.5 grams of the health food to get 100% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. However, we need to consume enough health food to get both vitamins E and A. The amount of health food needed to get both vitamins E and A is the least common multiple (LCM) of 11.11 and 12.5 grams. We can find the LCM by prime factorizing the two numbers: 11.11 = 11.11 x 100/100 = 1111/100 12.5 = 12.5 x 100/100 = 1250/100 Prime factorization of 1111: 1111 = 11 x 101 Prime factorization of 1250: 1250 = 2 x 5^3 x 5 So the LCM is 2 x 5^3 x 11 x 101 = 27710/100 = 277.1 grams (rounded to one decimal place). Therefore, we need to consume 277.1 grams of the health food daily to get at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins E and A. None of the answer choices are correct.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume the marked price of the watch is \"x\". According to the first condition, the shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%, so the selling price is 0.95x. According to the second condition, if the shopkeeper gives a discount of 7%, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit. Let's assume the profit percentage is \"p\". Then, we have: 0.93x = (1 + p/100)(0.95x) - 15 Simplifying this expression, we get: 0.93x = 0.95x + 0.95px/100 - 15 0.02x = 0.95px/100 - 15 0.02x + 15 = 0.95px/100 Dividing both sides by 0.95p, we get: x = (0.02x + 1500)/p Solving for x, we get: x = 1500/(100/p - 0.02) Now, we need to find the value of p. Let's assume the cost price of the watch is \"c\". Then, we have: c = 0.95x + 15 According to the profit formula, we have: p = (selling price - cost price)/cost price * 100 Substituting the values of selling price and cost price, we get: p = (0.93x - c)/c * 100 Substituting the value of c, we get: p = (0.93x - 0.95x - 15)/(0.95x + 15) * 100 Simplifying this expression, we get: p = -2x/(19x + 300) * 100 Substituting the value of x in terms of p, we get: x = 1500/(100/p - 0.02) x = 150000/(p - 2) - 7500/19 Substituting this value of x in the expression for p, we get: p = -30000/(p - 2)(19p - 3800) Solving for p, we get: p = 50 or p = 76.3158... We can reject the value of p=76.3158... because the profit percentage cannot be greater than 100%. Therefore, the profit percentage is 50%. Substituting this value of p in the expression for x, we get: x = 1500/(100/50 - 0.02) x = Rs. 750 Therefore, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750. The answer is (D) Rs. 750.",

Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Step 1: Find the number of pens the company needs to manufacture to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler. Since 10% of the produced pens are defective, the company needs to manufacture more pens to compensate for the rejected pens. Let's assume the number of pens the company needs to manufacture is \"x\". Then, 90% of x should be equal to 7200. Mathematically, we can write: 0.9x = 7200 x = 8000 Step 2: Find the total revenue from selling 8000 pens at Rs. 10 each. Total revenue = 8000 x Rs. 10 = Rs. 80,000 Step 3: Find the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. This means the total profit is 25% of the total cost. Let's assume the total cost is \"C\". Then, we can write: Total profit = 0.25C Step 4: Find the total cost of manufacturing 8000 pens. Since 10% of the produced pens are defective, the company needs to manufacture 8000/0.9 = 8888.89 pens. Let's assume the cost of manufacturing each pen is \"c\". Then, the total cost of manufacturing 8888.89 pens is 8888.89 x c. Step 5: Equate the total profit and the total revenue minus the total cost. We get: 0.25C = Rs. 80,000 - 8888.89c Solving for \"c\", we get: c = Rs. 6 Therefore, the manufactured cost of each pen is Rs. 6. The answer is (A) Rs. 6.",

We also know that the average score for the entire class is y, which means the sum of all the scores is y*z. \n\nTo find the sum of all the scores excluding the highest and lowest scorers, we need to subtract h and l from the sum of all the scores.

What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Step 1: Find the prime factorization of 1000. 1000 = 2^3 x 5^3 Step 2: Find the number of positive integers less than or equal to 1000 that are not relatively prime to 1000. These are the integers that have a common factor with 1000 other than 1. The number of integers that are divisible by 2 is 500. The number of integers that are divisible by 5 is 200. However, we have double-counted the integers that are divisible by both 2 and 5 (i.e. by 10), so we need to subtract them once. The number of integers that are divisible by 10 is 100. Therefore, the total number of integers that are not relatively prime to 1000 is 500 + 200 - 100 = 600. Step 3: Find the number of positive integers less than or equal to 1000 that are relatively prime to 1000. These are the integers that have no common factor with 1000 other than 1. The number of such integers is equal to the total number of integers minus the number of integers that are not relatively prime to 1000. Therefore, the number of integers that are relatively prime to 1000 is 1000 - 600 = 400. Step 4: Find the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1000. This is equal to the number of integers that are relatively prime to 1000 divided by the total number of integers in S, which is 1000. Therefore, the probability is 400/1000 = 2/5. Therefore, the answer is (D) 2/5. The answer is D.",

Mr.Blue can do 1/12 of the job in one day. Step 2: Find the total fraction of the job that all three painters can do in one day. Total fraction of the job that all three painters can do in one day = 1/6 + 1/8 + 1/12 = 2/8 = 1/4 Step 3: Find the fraction of the job that all three painters can do in 8 days. Fraction of the job that all three painters can do in 8 days = 8 x (1/4) = 2 Step 4: Find the fraction of the job that Mr.Brown can do in 8 days.

According to the problem, the diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. So, the total amount of money she gets can be expressed as: 20x + 25y = 340 (in cents) We need to find the minimum number of copper coins she brought, which means we need to minimize the value of x. We can rewrite the above equation as: 4x + 5y = 68 (dividing both sides by 5) Since 4 and 5 are relatively prime, we can see that x must be a multiple of 5 in order for the left-hand side to be a multiple of 5. The smallest multiple of 5 that is greater than or equal to 68/4 = 17 is 20. So, let's assume that x=20. Substituting this value in the above equation, we get: 4(20) + 5y = 68 5y = 8 y = 8/5 Since y must be an integer, this assumption leads to a contradiction. So, we need to try the next smallest multiple of 5, which is 15. Let's assume that x=15. Substituting this value in the above equation, we get: 4(15) + 5y = 68 5y = 8 y = 8/5 Since y must be an integer, this assumption also leads to a contradiction.

Substituting this value in the above equation, we get: 4(10) + 5y = 68 5y = 28 y = 28/5 Since y must be an integer, the only possible value is y=5.

In another month 620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs.2040. In another month 500 units are consumed due to more\nholidays. The bill for that month would be : Answer Choices: (A) Rs.1560 (B) Rs.1680 (C) Rs.1840 (D) Rs.1950 (E) Rs.1690",
            "Pred_Rationale": "We can start by using the given information to form two equations in two variables, which we can then solve to find the fixed and variable components of the telephone bill. Let x be the fixed component and y be the variable component (i.e. the cost per call). Then we have:\n\n540y + x = 1800\n620y + x = 2040\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\n\n80y = 240\n\ny = 3\n\nSubstituting this value of y into either of the equations above, we get:\n\n540(3) + x = 1800\n\nx = 1260\n\nSo the fixed component of the telephone bill is Rs.1260 and the variable component is Rs.3 per call. To find the bill for the month with 500 calls, we can use the variable component to get:\n\n500(3) + 1260 = Rs.2760\n\nHowever, this answer is not one of the answer choices. We can check our work by using the other given information. In the month with 620 calls, the bill increased by Rs.240 compared to the month with 540 calls. This corresponds to an increase of 80 calls, so the variable component of the bill is Rs.3 per call, as we found. Therefore, our answer of Rs.2760 for the month with 500 calls must be incorrect. We can use the same reasoning to find the correct answer:\n\n620(3) + x = 2040\n540(3) + x = 1800\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get:\n\n80y = 240\n\ny = 3\n\nSubstituting this value of y into either of the equations above, we get:\n\n540(3) + x = 1800\n\nx = 1260\n\nSo the fixed component of the telephone bill is Rs.1260 and the variable component is Rs.3 per call. To find the bill for the month with 500 calls, we can use the variable component to get:\n\n500(3) + 1260 = Rs.1710\n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) Rs.1690.",

We can use this information to find the other factor and then solve for m. \n\nTo find the other factor, we can use polynomial division or the fact that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation is -m/a, where a is the coefficient of the x^2 term. Since one of the roots is 1.5, the other root is (-m/1)/1.5 = -m/1.5. The sum of the roots is 1.5 - m/1.5, which must be equal to -m/1. \n\nTherefore, we have: \n\n1.5 - m/1.5 = -m/1 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 1.5, we get: \n\n2.25 - m = -1.5m \n\nAdding 1.5m to both sides, we get: \n\n2.25 = 0.5m \n\nDividing both sides by 0.5, we get: \n\nm = 4.5 \n\nTherefore, the value of m is 4.5.

If x helpers work for 3 hours, they can make 6x large cakes. Therefore, we need to solve the equation: 6x = 20, which gives x = 10. So, 10 helpers can make 20 large cakes in 3 hours.

If each helper can make 35/3 small cakes per hour, then x helpers can make 35x/3 small cakes per hour. If x helpers work for 3 hours, they can make 35x small cakes.

To find the distance between A's final position and home, we need to find the horizontal and vertical components separately and then use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance.\n\nThe horizontal component is the distance between A's final position and the home in the east-west direction. A has traveled 5km east and 2km west, so the net distance traveled in the east-west direction is 5km - 2km = 3km to the east. Therefore, the horizontal component is 3km.\n\nThe vertical component is the distance between A's final position and the home in the north-south direction. A has traveled 3km south and 3km north, so the net distance traveled in the north-south direction is 0km. Therefore, the vertical component is 0km.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the distance between A's final position and home:\n\ndistance = sqrt(horizontal component^2 + vertical component^2) = sqrt(3^2 + 0^2) = 3km\n\nTherefore, A is 3km away from home.

The amount he needs to borrow is $20,000, and the amount he needs to pay within 30 days is 96% of $20,000, which is $19,200. The interest he pays for borrowing the money is the difference between the amount he borrows and the amount he pays within 30 days, which is $800. Let's assume that he borrows the money for x days at a simple interest rate of r%.

Since [x+y] is an integer between [x]+[y] and [x]+[y]+1, we can write [x+y] = [x]+[y]+k for some k in {0,1}. Substituting this into the equation [x]+[y]+[x+y] = [2x]+[2y], we get [x]+[y]+[x]+[y]+k = 2[2x]+2[2y], which simplifies to [x]+[y]+k = 2[2x]+2[2y]-[x]-[y]. Since the left-hand side is an integer between [x]+[y] and [x]+[y]+1, and the right-hand side is an even integer, there is no solution to this equation.\n- L(x,y) < R(x,y) if and only if [x]+[y]+[x+y] < [2x]+[2y]. Since [x+y] is an integer between [x]+[y] and [x]+[y]+1, we can write [x+y] = [x]+[y]+k for some k in {0,1}. Substituting this into the inequality [x]+[y]+[x+y] < [2x]+[2y], we get [x]+[y]+[x]+[y]+k < 2[2x]+2[2y], which simplifies to [x]+[y]+k < 2[2x]+2[2y]-[x]-[y]. Since the left-hand side is an integer between [x]+[y] and [x]+[y]+1, and the right-hand side is an even integer, there is always a solution to this inequality.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) L(x,y) < R(x,y).",

Then, we have:\n\nL + B = 5y\n=> L + B = 5(2x/1)\n=> L + B = 10x\n\nThe area of the four walls of the room is:\n\n2xL + 2x(B-0.5) + 2xL + 2x(B-0.5) = 4x(L+B-1)\n\nThe cost of papering the walls is Rs.260, which is equal to the cost of papering an area of:\n\n260/2 = 130 sq.m\n\nAfter deducting the area of doors and windows (15 sq.m), we get the area of the walls to be papered as:\n\n130 - 15 = 115 sq.m\n\nThe area of the four walls is:\n\n4x(L+B-1)\n\nWe know that LB = 2x(L+B-1), since the height of the room is 2x.

Step 2: We need to find the number formed by the digits in reverse order. If we subtract 495 from the original number, we get: ABC - 495 = CBA Step 3: We can write CBA as 100C + 10B + A. We know that A+B+C=17, so we can substitute C=17-A-B into the expression for CBA: CBA = 100(17-A-B) + 10B + A = 1700 - 90A - 9B Step 4: We can equate the expressions for CBA and ABC - 495: 1700 - 90A - 9B = 100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100A + 10B + (17-A-B) - 495 = 99A - 9B - 478 Step 5: Simplifying this expression, we get: 189A = 1183 A = 6 Step 6: Substituting A=6 into the expression for A+B+C=17, we get: B+C=11 Step 7: We know that A^2+B^2+C^2=109.

Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the hotel buys x newspapers on each of the rest of the days of the week. According to the problem, the hotel buys twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week. So, the hotel buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. The cost of each newspaper on Sunday is $4, and the cost of each newspaper on the rest of the days of the week is $1. Therefore, the total cost of newspapers per week is: 4(2x) + 1(7x) = 8x + 7x = 15x The problem tells us that the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 15x = 210 Solving for x, we get: x = 14 Therefore, the hotel buys 14 newspapers on each of the rest of the days of the week, and 2x = 28 newspapers on Sunday. Therefore, the hotel buys a total of 7x + 28 = 7(14) + 28 = 126 newspapers per week. Since the hotel buys 28 newspapers on Sunday, it must buy 14 newspapers on each of the other six days of the week to reach a total of 126 newspapers per week. Therefore, the hotel buys 14 newspapers on Monday. The answer is (A) 15.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the rate of hose A is \"a\" and the rate of hose B is \"b\". We know that hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, so its rate is 1/8 of the pool per hour. We also know that hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours, so it filled 2/8 or 1/4 of the pool. This means that 3/4 of the pool was filled by both hoses working together in 3 hours. Let's use the formula: rate x time = work done to find the rate of both hoses working together. We have: (a + b) x 3/4 = 1 Multiplying both sides by 4/3, we get: a + b = 4/3 Now, we can use the formula: rate x time = work done to find the time it would take for hose B to fill the entire pool. We have: b x t = 1 Solving for t, we get: t = 1/b Substituting the expression for a + b from above, we get: b x t = 1 b x (4/3 - a) = 1 4b/3 - ab = 1 Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: 4b - 3ab = 3 Rearranging, we get: b(4 - 3a) = 3 Dividing both sides by 4 - 3a, we get: b = 3/(4 - 3a) Substituting the value of a = 1/8, we get: b = 3/(4 - 3/8) = 24/31 Therefore, the time it would take for hose B to fill the entire pool is: t = 1/b = 31/24 hours.

Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B? Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the distance between A and B is \"d\" miles. Let's also assume that Kevin drove for \"t\" hours from A to B. Since he drove at a constant speed of 70 mph, we have: d = 70t (Equation 1) When he turned around at B, he had already traveled a distance of d miles. Let's assume that he took \"x\" hours to reach the point that was 70 miles away from B. Since he was still approaching B at that point, we know that x < t. Therefore, the remaining time for his trip would be (t-x-3) hours. During this time, he traveled a distance of 70 miles (from the point that was 70 miles away from B to B). Since he drove at a constant speed of 90 mph on his return trip, we have: 70 = 90(t-x-3) (Equation 2) Solving Equation 1 for t, we get: t = d/70 Substituting this expression for t in Equation 2, we get: 70 = 90(d/70-x-3) Simplifying this expression, we get: 1 = 9(d/70-x-3)/7 7 = 9(d/70-x-3) 7/9 = d/70-x-3 Solving for x, we get: x = d/70 - 7/9 + 3 x = d/70 - 52/63 Now, we know that x < t, so we have: d/70 - 52/63 < d/70 Solving for d, we get: d > 630 Therefore, the distance between A and B is greater than 630 miles.

We also know that Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. This means that the perimeter of the three sides that need fencing is l + 2w - 10. We can set up an equation for this perimeter using the fact that the area is lw = 240: l + 2w - 10 = P/3, where P is the perimeter of the rectangular yard. Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: 3l + 6w - 30 = P Solving for P, we get: P = 3l + 6w - 30 We also know that the length of fencing needed is equal to the perimeter of the three sides that need fencing. Therefore, we can substitute P = 3l + 6w - 30 into the expression for the length of fencing needed: Length of fencing = P = 3l + 6w - 30 We can now use the fact that lw = 240 to eliminate one of the variables. Solving for l, we get: l = 240/w Substituting this into the expression for the length of fencing, we get: Length of fencing = 3l + 6w - 30 = 3(240/w) + 6w - 30 = (720 + 6w^2 - 30w)/w Taking the derivative of this expression with respect to w and setting it equal to zero to find the maximum value, we get: 12w - 30 = 0 w = 2.5 Substituting this value of w back into the expression for the length of fencing, we get: Length of fencing = (720 + 6(2.5)^2 - 30(2.5))/2.5 = 66 Therefore, Alice needs 66 meters of fencing.

Therefore, we have: 180 = 10s*t Solving for t, we get: t = 18 hours Now, we can find the distance traveled by the plane in 18 hours: Distance = Speed * Time = 10s * 18 = 180s miles Since the ship also traveled for 18 hours, its distance from the starting point is: Distance = Speed * Time = s * 18 = 18s miles Therefore, the total distance from the starting point is: Total distance = Distance traveled by ship + Distance traveled by plane = 18s + 180s = 198s miles None of the answer choices match 198s, so we need to calculate the value of s to get the answer. We can use the fact that the plane travels 10 times faster than the ship: 10s = speed of plane = distance traveled by plane / time taken by plane = Total distance - 180 miles / 18 hours = 198s - 180 / 18 = 198s - 10 Therefore, we have: 10s = 198s - 10 Solving for s, we get: s = 2 miles per hour Therefore, the total distance from the starting point is: Total distance = 198s = 198 x 2 = 396 miles The answer is not in the answer choices.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Step 1: Find the amount of sand and clay in the original mixture. Amount of sand = 30% of 10kg = 3kg Amount of clay = 70% of 10kg = 7kg Step 2: Let's assume that x kg of the mixture is removed and replaced with pure sand. After the replacement, the amount of sand in the mixture will be (3-x)kg and the amount of clay will be (7-x)kg. Step 3: We want the mixture to contain equal quantities of sand and clay. This means that (3-x)kg = (7-x)kg Solving for x, we get: x = 2kg Step 4: We need to find the amount of mixture that needs to be removed. Since x kg of the mixture is removed and replaced with pure sand, the total amount of mixture that needs to be removed is 2x kg. Therefore, the amount of mixture that needs to be removed is 2 x 2kg = 4kg. Step 5: We need to find the amount of pure sand that needs to be added. Since 2kg of the mixture is replaced with pure sand, we need to add 2kg of pure sand. Therefore, the answer is 2/10 = 1/5 = 0.2kg. However, this is not one of the answer choices. We can convert this to a fraction and see which answer choice is closest: 0.2kg = 2/10kg = 1/5kg = 1/5 x 1000g/kg = 200g/1000g = 2/10 = 1/5 So the answer is (A) 10/7.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we can simplify the expression for x as follows: x = (n^2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4\u221an+ 4) = [(n + \u221an + 4)^2] / [(n + \u221an + 4)(n + \u221an)] = (n + \u221an + 4) / (n + \u221an) Now, we can use the given range for n to find the range for x. We know that n is between 36 and 72, so: \u221a36 = 6 \u2264 \u221an \u2264 \u221a72 = 6\u221a2 Adding 4 to both sides, we get: 10 \u2264 \u221an + 4 \u2264 6\u221a2 + 4 = 10.39 Therefore, we have: n + \u221an + 4 \u2265 36 + 10 + 10 = 56 n + \u221an \u2264 72 + 6\u221a2 < 72 + 7(2) = 86 Now, we can find the range for x: (n + \u221an + 4) / (n + \u221an) > (56) / (86) \u2248 0.6512 (n + \u221an + 4) / (n + \u221an) < (72 + 10.39 + 4) / (72 + 10.39) \u2248 1.1865 Multiplying both sides by (n + \u221an), we get: n + \u221an + 4 > 0.6512n + 0.6512\u221an n + \u221an + 4 < 1.1865n + 1.1865\u221an Subtracting 0.6512n + 4 from both sides of the first inequality, we get: 0.3488n > -0.6512\u221an + 4 Subtracting 1.1865n from both sides of the second inequality, we get: -0.1865n + 4 < -1.1865\u221an Dividing both sides of the first inequality by 0.3488\u221an, we get: n / \u221an > -1.8681 + 11.4853 / \u221an Dividing both sides of the second inequality by -1.1865, we get: n / \u221an > 3.3765 Squaring both sides of both inequalities, we get: n^2 / n > 3.4914 and n^2 / n > 11.4293 Therefore, we have: n > 12.5^2 / 13 \u2248 119.79 and n > 40^2 / 41 \u2248 39.02 Since n is an integer, we have n \u2265 120 and n \u2265 40.

This means we need to find the area of the region that is outside the rectangle but inside the rectangle with a 1-meter broad boundary. The length and width of this region will be (L+2) and (W+2), respectively. Therefore, the area of this region will be: (L+2)(W+2) - LW Expanding this expression, we get: LW + 2L + 2W + 4 - LW = 2L + 2W + 4 We know that the area of this region is equal to the product of its dimensions and the cost per square meter is given as $10. Therefore, the cost of gardening this region will be: Cost = 10 x (2L + 2W + 4) = 20L + 20W + 40 We can substitute L+W=170 in this expression to get: Cost = 20(170) + 40 = 3440 Therefore, the cost of gardening a 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot is $3440.

When the angle of elevation is 45\u00b0, we have: h/x = tan(45\u00b0) = 1, so h = x. When the angle of elevation is 60\u00b0, we have: h/(x+vt) = tan(60\u00b0) = \u221a3, where t is the additional time taken by the car to reach the base of the tower. Simplifying this expression, we get: h = \u221a3(x+vt) Rearranging this equation, we get: x+vt = h/\u221a3 = x/\u221a3 (since h=x) Solving for t, we get: t = (x/\u221a3 - x)/v = x(\u221a3 - 1)/v Therefore, the additional time taken by the car to reach the base of the tower is x(\u221a3 - 1)/v. We need to express this time in minutes, so we need to convert x and v to appropriate units. Let's assume that x is in kilometers and v is in kilometers per hour. Then, the additional time taken by the car is: t = (x/\u221a3 - x)/(v/60) = 60x(\u221a3 - 1)/v minutes. We don't know the values of x and v, but we can eliminate answer choices based on their units.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Step 1: Find the amount of zinc and copper in alloy X. Let the amount of zinc in alloy X be 6x and the amount of copper be 9x. Then, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy X is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. So, we can write: 2x/3x = 6/9 Solving for x, we get: x = 3 So, alloy X contains 6(3) = 18 grams of zinc and 9(3) = 27 grams of copper. Step 2: Find the amount of zinc and copper in alloy Y. Let the amount of zinc in alloy Y be 7y and the amount of copper be 11y. Then, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Y is 7:11. So, we can write: 7y/11y = 7/11 Solving for y, we get: y = 11 So, alloy Y contains 7(11) = 77 grams of zinc and 11(11) = 121 grams of copper. Step 3: Find the amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z. Alloy Z is formed by melting 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y. So, the total amount of zinc in alloy Z is 18 + 77 = 95 grams and the total amount of copper is 27 + 121 = 148 grams.

Since the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, the volume of silver in the alloy is also V. Therefore, the total volume of the alloy is 2V. Step 3: Let the density of aluminum be d.

            "Pred_Rationale": "There are a total of 5 horses, so the total number of ways to select 2 horses is given by the combination formula: C(5,2) = 5! / (2! * 3!) = 10. Mr. Jain can select any 2 horses out of the 5, so there are 10 equally likely outcomes. Out of these 10 outcomes, there is only 1 outcome where both horses selected by Mr. Jain are the winning horse. Therefore, the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse is 1/10. None of the answer choices match this result, so the answer is None of the above.",

If electricity is gone and I want at least two ties of same colour then how many ties I should take out from my rack? Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 4 (D) 5 (E) 6",
            "Pred_Rationale": "We can use the Pigeonhole Principle to solve this problem. If we want at least two ties of the same color, then we can think of each color as a \"hole\" and the ties as \"pigeons\". We want to know how many ties we need to take out to guarantee that at least two of them are in the same \"hole\". The worst-case scenario is that we take out one tie from each \"hole\", which would give us a total of 8+13+10+5+4 = 40 ties. However, if we take out one more tie, we are guaranteed to have at least two ties of the same color. Therefore, we need to take out 5 ties to guarantee that we have at least two ties of the same color. The answer is (D) 5.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Step 1: Find the length of the space diagonal of the rectangular solid. The space diagonal is the distance between opposite corners of the solid. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have: d^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2 d^2 = 9 + 16 + 225 d^2 = 250 d = sqrt(250) Step 2: The diameter of the sphere is equal to the space diagonal of the rectangular solid. Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is: 2d = 2sqrt(250) = 10sqrt(10) \u2248 31.546 \u2248 31.55 (rounded to two decimal places) Therefore, the answer is (A) 13.3542. None of the answer choices are correct. The correct answer is approximately 31.55.",
