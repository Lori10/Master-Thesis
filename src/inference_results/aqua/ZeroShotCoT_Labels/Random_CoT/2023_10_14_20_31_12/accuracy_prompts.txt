Answer Choices: (A) 25 (B) 66 (C) 288 (D) 29 (E) 17\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 9.6 kg to grams: 9.6 kg = 9.6 x 1000 g = 9600 g Now we can set up the proportion: 28 g / 9600 g = x / 100 Solving for x: x = (28 x 100) / 9600 x = 0.29 So the answer is approximately 29%. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 29. The answer is D.\n\nQ: By weight, liquid X makes up 0.5 percent of solution P and 1.5 percent of solution Q. If 200 grams of solution P are mixed with 800 grams of solution Q, then liquid X accounts for what percent of the weight of the resulting solution? Answer Choices: (A) 1.3% (B) 1.2% (C) 1.1% (D) 1.0% (E) 0.9%\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much liquid X is in 200 grams of solution P and 800 grams of solution Q. Liquid X in 200 grams of solution P = 0.5% of 200 grams = 1 gram Liquid X in 800 grams of solution Q = 1.5% of 800 grams = 12 grams Total liquid X in the resulting solution = 1 gram + 12 grams = 13 grams Now, we need to find out what percent of the weight of the resulting solution is 13 grams. Total weight of resulting solution = 200 grams + 800 grams = 1000 grams Percent of liquid X in the resulting solution = (13 grams / 1000 grams) x 100% = 1.3% Therefore, the answer is (A) 1.3%. The answer is A.\n\nQ: The largest natural number which exactly divides the product of any four consecutive natural numbers is: Answer Choices: (A) 6 (B) 12 (C) 24 (D) 120 (E) 160\n\nA: Let's think step by step. We can start by assuming four consecutive natural numbers as n, n+1, n+2, and n+3. The product of these four numbers would be: n x (n+1) x (n+2) x (n+3) = n(n+3) x (n+1)(n+2) = (n^2 + 3n) x (n^2 + 3n + 2) = n^4 + 6n^3 + 11n^2 + 6n Now, we need to find the largest natural number that exactly divides this expression. We can see that 2 and 3 both divide the expression. To check if any larger number divides the expression, we can try to factorize it. n^4 + 6n^3 + 11n^2 + 6n = n(n^3 + 6n^2 + 11n + 6) = n(n+1)(n^2 + 5n + 6) = n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3) So, the largest natural number that exactly divides the product of any four consecutive natural numbers is the product of the four consecutive numbers divided by their LCM. LCM of (n, n+1, n+2, n+3) = (n+3) if n is not divisible by 3, otherwise LCM = 3(n+3). Therefore, the largest natural number that exactly divides the product of any four consecutive natural numbers is 3 x (n+3) if n is divisible by 3, otherwise it is (n+3). Looking at the answer choices, we can see that (C) 24 is the correct answer. The answer is C.\n\nQ: If a man can cover 12 metres in one second, how many kilometres can he cover in 3 hours 45 minutes? Answer Choices: (A) 288 (B) 162 (C) 878 (D) 168 (E) 122\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert 3 hours 45 minutes into seconds. 3 hours = 3 x 60 x 60 = 10,800 seconds 45 minutes = 45 x 60 = 2,700 seconds Total time = 10,800 + 2,700 = 13,500 seconds Now, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time The man's speed is 12 metres per second. So, distance covered in 13,500 seconds = 12 x 13,500 = 162,000 metres We need to convert this to kilometres: 1 kilometre = 1000 metres So, distance covered in 3 hours 45 minutes = 162,000/1000 = 162 kilometres Therefore, the answer is (B) 162. The answer is B.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",

Answer Choices: (A) 50% (B) 100% (C) 150% (D) 200% (E) 250%\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the cost price of the item is $100. If the selling price is quadrupled, the new selling price would be $400. Let's say the profit made at the original selling price was $x. If the profit is pentadrupled, the new profit would be $5x. Profit = Selling price - Cost price So, x = Selling price - $100 $5x = $400 - $100 $5x = $300 x = $60 Therefore, the original profit was $60 and the new profit is $300. Percentage increase in profit = (New profit - Original profit) / Original profit * 100 = (300 - 60) / 60 * 100 = 400% So, the answer is (D) 200%. The answer is D.\n\nQ: There are two examinations rooms A and B. If 10 students are sent from A to B, then the number of students in each room is the same. If 20 candidates are sent from B to A, then the number of students in A is double the number of students in B. The number of students in room A is: Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 110 (C) 120 (D) 130 (E) 140\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the initial number of students in room A is \"x\" and in room B is \"y\". According to the first condition, if 10 students are sent from A to B, then the number of students in each room is the same. So, after the transfer, the number of students in each room will be (x-10) and (y+10). According to the second condition, if 20 candidates are sent from B to A, then the number of students in A is double the number of students in B. So, after the transfer, the number of students in each room will be (x+20) and (y-20/2) = (y-10). Now, we can equate both expressions for the number of students in room B: y+10 = y-10/2 Solving for y, we get: y = 30 Substituting this value in the expression for the number of students in room A, we get: x+20 = 2(y-10) x+20 = 2(30-10) x+20 = 40 x = 20 Therefore, the number of students in room A is 20+20 = 40. None of the above answer choices are correct. The answer is A.\n\nQ: A vendor buys 10 t-shirts at an average price of $14 per t-shirt. He then buys 15 more t-shirts at an average price of $11 per t-shirt. What is the average price D per t-shirt that the vendor paid for these purchases? Answer Choices: (A) $12.20 (B) $12.50 (C) $12.55 (D) $12.70 (E) $13.00\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total cost of the first purchase of 10 t-shirts. Total cost of 10 t-shirts = 10 x $14 = $140 Step 2: Find the total cost of the second purchase of 15 t-shirts. Total cost of 15 t-shirts = 15 x $11 = $165 Step 3: Find the total cost of both purchases. Total cost of both purchases = $140 + $165 = $305 Step 4: Find the total number of t-shirts purchased. Total number of t-shirts = 10 + 15 = 25 Step 5: Find the average price per t-shirt. Average price per t-shirt = Total cost of both purchases / Total number of t-shirts D = $305 / 25 = $12.20 Therefore, the answer is (A) $12.20. The answer is A.\n\nQ: Let f(x,y) be defined as the remainder when (x\u2013y)! is divided by x. If x=16, what is the maximum value of y for which f(x,y)=0? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (B) 10 (C) 15 (D) 20 (E) 25\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the value of (x-y)!. Since x=16, we have (16-y)!. Next, we need to find the remainder when (16-y)! is divided by 16. This means we need to find the largest value of y such that (16-y)! is divisible by 16. We know that 16=2^4, so we need to find the largest power of 2 that divides (16-y)!. We can use the formula for the highest power of a prime p that divides n!, which is given by: \u230an/p\u230b + \u230an/p^2\u230b + \u230an/p^3\u230b + ... where \u230ax\u230b denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. In this case, p=2 and n=16-y, so we have: \u230a(16-y)/2\u230b + \u230a(16-y)/4\u230b + \u230a(16-y)/8\u230b + \u230a(16-y)/16\u230b Simplifying this expression, we get: 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15 So the largest power of 2 that divides (16-y)! is 2^15. Therefore, the maximum value of y for which f(x,y)=0 is 15. The answer is (C) 15. The answer is C.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
