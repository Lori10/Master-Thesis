Answer Choices: (A) s.59 (B) s.58 (C) s.09 (D) s.50 (E) s.66\n\nA: Let's think step by step. The shopkeeper sold 200 meters of cloth for Rs. 12000, which means he sold each meter for Rs. 60 (12000/200). Now, we know that he sold each meter at a loss of Rs. 6. So, his cost price for each meter would be Rs. 66 (60+6). Therefore, the correct answer is (E) Rs. 66. The answer is E.\n\nQ: Carmelo and LeBron participate in a seven-person footrace on the basketball court during All-Star Weekend. If all seven contestants finish (including Charles Barkley) and there are no ties, how many different arrangements of finishes are there in which Carmelo defeats LeBron? Answer Choices: (A)  5040 (B)  2520 (C)  720 (D)  120 (E)  42\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to choose the positions for Carmelo and LeBron. There are 2 options for the first place, and once that is decided, there is only 1 option for the second place. Next, we need to arrange the remaining 5 people in the remaining 5 positions. There are 5 options for the third place, 4 options for the fourth place, 3 options for the fifth place, 2 options for the sixth place, and 1 option for the seventh place. Therefore, the total number of arrangements in which Carmelo defeats LeBron is 2 x 1 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 240. None of the answer choices match our result, so the answer is None of the above. The answer is B.\n\nQ: If a:b = 4:1, then find (a - 3b)/(2a - b)? Answer Choices: (A) 6/7 (B) 1/7 (C) 5/7 (D) 3/2 (E) 4/7\n\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that a:b = 4:1, which means that a = 4b. Substituting this value of a in the expression (a - 3b)/(2a - b), we get: (4b - 3b)/(2(4b) - b) = b/(8b - b) = b/7b = 1/7 Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 1/7. The answer is B.\n\nQ: Linda bought 3 notebooks at $1.20 each; a box of pencils at $1.50 and a box of pens at $1.70. How much did Linda spend? Answer Choices: (A) $6.80 (B) $2.80 (C) $4.80 (D) $7.80 (E) $8.80\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Linda bought 3 notebooks at $1.20 each, so she spent 3 x $1.20 = $3.60 on notebooks. She also bought a box of pencils at $1.50 and a box of pens at $1.70, so she spent $1.50 + $1.70 = $3.20 on stationery. Therefore, Linda spent a total of $3.60 + $3.20 = $6.80. The correct answer is (A) $6.80. The answer is A.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step."

            "Pred_Rationale": "The company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each, so the total revenue from the sale of pens is 7200 x Rs. 10 = Rs. 72,000. The company estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%, which means that the cost of manufacturing all the pens is 75% of the revenue. \n\nLet's find out how many pens the company needs to manufacture to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler. Since 10% of the produced pens are always defective, the company needs to produce 7200/0.9 = 8000 pens to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler.\n\nNow, let's find out the cost of manufacturing each pen. The cost of manufacturing all the pens is 75% of the revenue, which is Rs. 72,000 x 0.75 = Rs. 54,000. The cost of manufacturing each pen is Rs. 54,000/8000 = Rs. 6.75. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) None of these. None of the answer choices match our result.

Similarly, Mr. Black can paint 1/8 of a house in a day, and Mr. Blue can paint 1/12 of a house in a day.\n\nAfter 8 days, Mr. Brown has completed 8 x 1/6 = 4/3 of the work, while Mr. Black has completed 8 x 1/8 = 1 of the work. Together, they have completed 4/3 + 1 = 7/3 of the work.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much work is left to be done. Since they were contracted to paint 3 houses, and we know that Mr. Brown and Mr. Black together have completed 7/3 of the work, the amount of work left to be done is 3 - 7/3 = 2/3 of the work.\n\nMr. Black works for 6 more days, during which he completes 6 x 1/8 = 3/4 of the remaining work. The amount of work left to be done is now 2/3 - 3/4 = 5/12 of the work.\n\nFinally, we can use the fact that Mr. Blue can paint 1/12 of a house in a day to find out how many days he will take to complete the remaining work. Let's call the number of days he needs to complete the work \"d\". Then, we have:\n\nd x 1/12 = 5/12\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nd = 5\n\nTherefore, it will take Mr. Blue 5 more days to complete the contract.

However, since the pm must speak before the mp and the mp must speak before the mla, we only have 3 options for the positions of the pm, mp, and mla speakers.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We know that one of the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 is 1.5. This means that (x - 1.5) is a factor of the quadratic equation. We can use this information to find the other factor by dividing x^2 + mx + 22 by (x - 1.5) using long division or synthetic division. The result is x + (m + 1.5). Since this is a quadratic equation, the sum of the roots is equal to the negative of the coefficient of x divided by the coefficient of x^2. Therefore, the sum of the roots is -m/1 = -m. We know that one of the roots is 1.5, so the other root is - (m + 1.5). Therefore, the sum of the roots is 1.5 - (m + 1.5) = -m. Solving for m, we get m = -3.

            "Pred_Rationale": "At 9:00 am, the dog has eaten 1/3 of the original food, which means that 2/3 of the original food is left in the bowl. At 10:00 am, the dog has eaten another 1/3 of the remaining food, which means that 2/3 x 2/3 = 4/9 of the original food is left in the bowl.

To find the percentage of the original food that is left in the bowl, we need to divide 16/81 by the original amount of food and multiply by 100. However, we don't know the original amount of food, so we can't calculate the exact percentage.

            "Pred_Rationale": "According to the given information, x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days. Therefore, the rate of work of each man is 1/x units per day. Similarly, y men working y hours per day can do y units of work in y days. Therefore, the rate of work of each man is 1/y units per day. Now, we can use the formula: Work = Rate x Time. \n\nFor x men working x hours per day, the time taken to complete x units of work is x days. Therefore, the total number of man-hours required is x * x = x^2 man-hours. \n\nFor y men working y hours per day, the time taken to complete y units of work is y days. Therefore, the total number of man-hours required is y * y = y^2 man-hours. \n\nSince the amount of work done is the same in both cases, we can equate the two expressions for man-hours: \n\nx^2 = y^2 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx = y * sqrt(y) \n\nNow, we can substitute this value of x in the expression for the amount of work done by x men: \n\nx units of work = x men * x hours per day * x days \n\n= (y * sqrt(y)) men * (y * sqrt(y)) hours per day * y days \n\n= y^3 units of work \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) y^3/x^2 units.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the original side of the square piece of cloth was x feet. When 4 feet is trimmed from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become (x-4) feet and x feet. The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. Therefore, the area of the rectangular piece is 2 x 70 = 140 square feet. We can write an equation for the area of the rectangular piece as follows:\n\n(x-4) * x = 140\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx^2 - 4x - 140 = 0\n\nWe can factor this equation as:\n\n(x-14) * (x+10) = 0\n\nTherefore, x = 14 or x = -10.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the number of trousers purchased be x. Then, the amount spent on trousers is 70x. We know that the total amount spent is Rs. 810, so the amount spent on shirts is 810 - 70x. We also know that each shirt costs Rs. 30, so the number of shirts purchased is (810 - 70x)/30. We want to find the ratio of trousers to shirts, which is x/[(810 - 70x)/30]. Simplifying this expression, we get: x/[(810 - 70x)/30] = 30x/(810 - 70x) We want to maximize the number of trousers purchased, so we need to maximize the expression 30x/(810 - 70x). To do this, we take the derivative of the expression with respect to x and set it equal to zero: d/dx [30x/(810 - 70x)] = 0 2100/(810 - 70x)^2 = 0 810 - 70x = sqrt(2100) x = (810 - sqrt(2100))/70 We can verify that this value of x maximizes the expression by taking the second derivative and verifying that it is negative. Plugging in this value of x, we get: x = 9.02 (approx.) Therefore, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is 9. The number of shirts purchased is (810 - 70x)/30 = 7.3 (approx.).

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet are l and b respectively. When folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48cm. This means that the length of each part is (48/2) - b = 24 - b, and the breadth of each part is l. Therefore, the area of each part is (24 - b)l. When folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66cm. This means that the length of each part is (66/2) - l = 33 - l, and the breadth of each part is b. Therefore, the area of each part is (33 - l)b. Since both parts are equal, we can equate their areas: (24 - b)l = (33 - l)b. Expanding this equation, we get: 24l - bl = 33b - lb. Simplifying this equation, we get: 25b = 9l. We also know that the perimeter of the rectangular sheet is 2(l + b). Substituting the value of b from the previous equation, we get: 2(l + (9/25)l) = 48. Simplifying this equation, we get: (34/25)l = 24. Therefore, l = (25/34) x 24 = 18. The breadth of the rectangular sheet is b = (9/25)l = 6.48. Therefore, the area of the rectangular sheet is l x b = 18 x 6.48 = 116.64 cm^2. Rounding off to the nearest integer, we get 117. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above.

Let's assume that the distance between City A and City B is d. Train M travels at a rate of d/4, while Train N travels at a rate of d/3.5. \n\nWhen the two trains meet, they will have traveled a total distance of d.

Therefore, the interest he pays on the loan should be less than $800. \n\nLet's calculate the highest simple interest rate he can afford to pay. \n\nSimple interest = Principal x Rate x Time \n\nLet's assume he borrows P dollars at an interest rate of r% per year for t years. \n\nThen, the amount he owes after t years is: \n\nP + P*r*t \n\nIf he pays back the loan within 30 days, then t = 30/365 years. \n\nHe owes $19,200, so: \n\nP + P*r*t = $19,200 \n\nP(1 + r*t) = $19,200 \n\nP = $19,200 / (1 + r*t) \n\nSubstituting t = 30/365, we get: \n\nP = $19,200 / (1 + 0.01*r*30/365) \n\nP = $19,200 / (1 + 0.0082r) \n\nNow, let's assume he borrows P dollars at an interest rate of r% per year and pays it back within 30 days. \n\nThe interest he pays is: \n\nI = P*r*t \n\nSubstituting t = 30/365, we get: \n\nI = P*r*30/365 \n\nI = P*0.082*r \n\nSince he can afford to pay at most $800 in interest, we have: \n\nP*0.082*r <= $800 \n\nSubstituting P = $19,200 / (1 + 0.0082r), we get: \n\n($19,200 / (1 + 0.0082r)) * 0.082 * r <= $800 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\nr^2 - 121.95r + 24,000 <= 0 \n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get: \n\nr <= (121.95 + sqrt(121.95^2 - 4*1*24,000)) / 2 \n\nr <= (121.95 + 247.67) / 2 \n\nr <= 184.81 \n\nTherefore, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 184.81%. \n\nHowever, this answer is not among the answer choices.

Let the area of the doors and windows be A. Then, the area of the walls is:\n\n20x - A = (5x)(2x) = 10x^2\n\nWe know that the area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m, which is 1500 sq.cm.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that hose B takes x hours to fill the pool alone. \n\nIn the first 2 hours, hose A filled 2/8 = 1/4 of the pool. This means that 3/4 of the pool still needs to be filled. \n\nWorking together, hoses A and B can fill 3/4 of the pool in 3 hours. This means that their combined rate is 3/4 \u00f7 3 = 1/4 of the pool per hour. \n\nLet's use the formula: \n\nrate \u00d7 time = work \n\nFor hose A, we know that the rate is 1/8 (since it can fill the pool in 8 hours) and the time is 2 hours. So, the work done by hose A in the first 2 hours is: \n\n1/8 \u00d7 2 = 1/4 \n\nFor hoses A and B working together, we know that the rate is 1/4 and the time is 3 hours. So, the work done by hoses A and B together in the next 3 hours is: \n\n1/4 \u00d7 3 = 3/4 \n\nAdding the work done by hose A and hoses A and B together, we get: \n\n1/4 + 3/4 = 1 \n\nThis means that the entire pool has been filled. \n\nNow, we can use the formula again to find the rate of hose B: \n\nrate \u00d7 time = work \n\nrate \u00d7 x = 1 \n\nrate = 1/x \n\nSubstituting the value of rate and work, we get: \n\n1/x \u00d7 5 = 1 \n\nx = 5 \n\nTherefore, hose B takes 5 hours to fill the entire pool alone.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the number of friends who planned to go on the picnic be x. Then, they planned to spend Rs. 96, so each person's share would be Rs. 96/x. However, 4 of them did not turn up, so only (x-4) people attended the picnic. They had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each, so their new share was Rs. 96/(x-4) + Rs. 4. We know that the new share was greater than the original share, so we can write an equation: \n\nRs. 96/x < Rs. 96/(x-4) + Rs. 4 \n\nMultiplying both sides by x(x-4), we get: \n\n96(x-4) < 96x + 4x(x-4) \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n384 < 16x \n\nx > 24 \n\nSince x is the number of friends who planned to go on the picnic, it must be an integer. Therefore, the smallest possible value of x is 25. \n\nIf 25 friends planned to go on the picnic, then each person's share would be Rs. 3.84. However, only 21 friends attended the picnic, so they had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each, making their new share Rs. 7.84. The total amount they spent on eatables was Rs. 21 x Rs. 7.84 = Rs. 164.64, which is greater than Rs. 96.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We know that the retailer sold the appliance for 40% above cost, which means that the selling price was 100% + 40% = 140% of the cost price. Let's say the cost price was x. Then, the selling price would be 1.4x. We also know that the gross profit was $20.00, which means that the selling price was $20.00 + the cost price. Therefore, we can write the equation: 1.4x = $20.00 + x. Solving for x, we get x = $40.00. Substituting this value of x in the expression 1.4x, we get: 1.4 x $40.00 = $56.00.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Out of 5000 voters, 20% are not eligible to vote, which means 80% are eligible to vote. \n\nNumber of eligible voters = 80% of 5000 = 4000 \n\nLet's assume that the winning candidate got x votes. \n\nAs per the question, the winning candidate won by 15% of the votes. \n\nThis means that the losing candidate got (100% - 15%) = 85% of the votes. \n\nSo, the losing candidate got 85% of the total eligible votes, which is 0.85 * 4000 = 3400 votes. \n\nNow, we know that the winning candidate got x votes and the losing candidate got 3400 votes. \n\nAlso, we know that the total number of votes cast is 4000 (since 20% were not eligible to vote). \n\nSo, x + 3400 = 4000 \n\nSolving for x, we get x = 600 \n\nTherefore, the winning candidate got 600 votes. \n\nThe correct answer is (D) 2300. \n\nExplanation: \n\nIf the winning candidate got 600 votes, then the losing candidate got 3400 votes. \n\nSo, the total number of votes cast is 600 + 3400 = 4000. \n\nNow, we need to find the percentage of votes that the winning candidate got. \n\nPercentage of votes that the winning candidate got = (Votes for winning candidate / Total votes cast) * 100 \n\n= (600 / 4000) * 100 \n\n= 15% \n\nTherefore, the winning candidate got 15% of the votes. \n\nThe correct answer is (D) 2300.",

We can see that the frog is making a net progress of 1m each day. Therefore, it will take the frog 30 days to reach the top of the well (since it needs to make a net progress of 30m). However, we need to subtract the last day when the frog jumps 3m up, since it will already be out of the well.

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's start by using a Venn diagram to represent the information given in the problem. \n\nWe know that all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. Let's represent this with a rectangle that contains two overlapping circles. \n\nLet's also use the following variables: \n\n- Let x be the number of files infected only by a virus. \n- Let y be the number of files infected only by a worm. \n- Let z be the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. \n\nUsing the information given in the problem, we can fill in some of the values in the Venn diagram: \n\n- The total number of files is 250, so the sum of all the regions in the Venn diagram must be 250. \n- We know that y = 2.5z, so we can represent y in terms of z. \n- We know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so x + z = 0.5(250). \n\nUsing the equation x + z = 0.5(250), we can solve for x: \n\nx + z = 125 \n\nx + 0.4x = 125 (since z = 0.4x, using y = 2.5z) \n\n1.4x = 125 \n\nx = 89.3 (rounded to one decimal place) \n\nSince x represents the number of files infected only by a virus, the number of files not infected by a virus is 250 - x = 160. \n\nTo find the number of files not infected by a worm, we need to subtract the number of files infected only by a worm (y) and the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm (z) from the total number of files: \n\nNumber of files not infected by a worm = 250 - y - z \n\nUsing y = 2.5z, we can represent this in terms of z: \n\nNumber of files not infected by a worm = 250 - 3.5z \n\nTo find z, we can use the fact that the sum of all the regions in the Venn diagram is 250: \n\nx + y + z = 250 \n\n89.3 + y + z = 250 \n\ny + z = 160.7 \n\nUsing y = 2.5z, we can represent this in terms of z: \n\n2.5z + z = 160.7 \n\n3.5z = 160.7 \n\nz = 45.9 (rounded to one decimal place) \n\nNow we can find the number of files not infected by a worm: \n\nNumber of files not infected by a worm = 250 - 3.5z \n\nNumber of files not infected by a worm = 250 - 3.5(45.9) \n\nNumber of files not infected by a worm = 250 - 160.7 \n\nNumber of files not infected by a worm = 89.3 \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 100.",

Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The volume of the coin is given by the formula for the volume of a cylinder: V = \u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius (half the diameter) and h is the height (thickness) of the coin. Substituting the given values, we get: V = \u03c0(7.5 mm)^2(2 mm) = 352.5 mm^3.\n\nLet x be the volume of aluminum in the coin. Since the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, the volume of silver in the coin is also x. Therefore, the total volume of the alloy is 2x.\n\nLet y be the weight of aluminum in the coin. Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of silver in the coin is 2y. Therefore, the total weight of the alloy is y + 2y = 3y.\n\nWe know that the weight of the coin is 30 grams, so we can set up the equation: 3y = 30 g, which gives us y = 10 g.\n\nNow, we need to find the weight of a pure aluminum coin with the same volume as the alloy coin. The volume of the pure aluminum coin is given by the same formula as before: V = \u03c0r^2h, where r = 15/2 = 7.5 mm and h = 1 mm. Substituting these values, we get: V = \u03c0(7.5 mm)^2(1 mm) = 176.625 mm^3.\n\nSince the volume of the pure aluminum coin is half that of the alloy coin, we have x = 1/2(352.5 mm^3) = 176.25 mm^3.\n\nThe weight of the pure aluminum coin is given by the formula: weight = density x volume, where the density of aluminum is 2.7 g/cm^3. Converting the volume to cm^3, we get: 176.25 mm^3 = 0.17625 cm^3. Therefore, the weight of the pure aluminum coin is: weight = 2.7 g/cm^3 x 0.17625 cm^3 = 0.475 g.\n\nFinally, we need to convert the weight of the pure aluminum coin from grams to milligrams, since the answer choices are in milligrams. 0.475 g = 475 mg.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) 475 mg.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The diameter of the sphere is equal to the diagonal of the rectangular solid. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the diagonal of the rectangular solid: \n\nd^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2 \nd^2 = 9 + 16 + 225 \nd^2 = 250 \nd = sqrt(250) \n\nSimplifying the radical, we get: \n\nd = sqrt(25 x 10) \nd = 5 sqrt(10) \n\nTherefore, the diameter of the sphere is 2d = 10 sqrt(10). Rounding to four decimal places, we get 18.3451. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 18.3451. The answer is C.",
