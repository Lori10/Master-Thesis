If A and B start working on the project together and A quits 15 days before the project is completed, in how many days total will the project be completed? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 21 (C) 24 (D) 27 (E) 30\n\nA: Let's think step by step. A's rate is 1/20 of the project per day. B's rate is 1/30 of the project per day. The combined rate is 1/12 of the project per day. In the last 15 days, B can do 1/2 of the project. Thus A and B must complete 1/2 of the project, which takes 6 days. The total number of days is 6 + 15 = 21. The answer is B. The answer is B.\n\nQ: A jar full of whisky contains 40% alcohol. A part of this whisky is replaced by another containg 19% alcohol and now the percentage of alcohol was found to be 22%. What quantity of whisky is replaced ? Answer Choices: (A) 1/3 (B) 2/3 (C) 2/5 (D) 3/5 (E) 4/5\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Let us assume the total original amount of whiskey = 10 ml ---> 4 ml alcohol and 6 ml non-alcohol. Let x ml be the amount removed ---> total alcohol left = 4-0.4x New quantity of whiskey added = x ml out of which 0.19 is the alcohol. Thus, the final quantity of alcohol = 4-0.4x+0.19x ----> (4-0.21x)/ 10 = 0.26 ---> x = 20/3 ml. Per the question, you need to find the x ml removed as a ratio of the initial volume ---> (20/3)/10 = 3/5. Hence, D is the correct answer. The answer is D.\n\nQ: Shawn invested one half of his savings in a bond that paid simple interest for 2 years (20% per anum) and received $600 as interest. He invested the remaining in a bond that paid compound interest, interest being compounded annually, for the same 2 years at the same rate of interest and received $655 as interest. What was the value of his total savings before investing in these two bonds? Answer Choices: (A) 3000 (B) 5000 (C) 6000 (D) 8000 (E) 9000\n\nA: Let's think step by step. So, we know that Shawn received 20% of the amount he invested in a year. We also know that in one year Shawn received $300, thud 0.2x = $300 --> x = $1,500. Since, he invested equal sums in his 2 bonds, then his total savings before investing was 2*$1,500 = $3,000. Answer: A The answer is A.\n\nQ: If the range of the set of numbers {150, 90, 125, 110, 170, 155, x, 100, 140} is 90, which of the following could be x? Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 95 (C) 110 (D) 125 (E) 140\n\nA: Let's think step by step. The range of the other 8 numbers is 170-90 = 80, so x must be either the smallest number or the largest number in the set. Then x = 170-90 = 80 or x = 90+90 = 180 The answer is A. The answer is A.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step."

To get 100% of vitamin E, we need to eat 100/9 grams of the health food. Similarly, to get 100% of vitamin A, we need to eat 100/8 grams of the health food. Since we need to get both vitamins, we need to take the maximum of these two amounts, which is 100/8 grams.

We can use substitution to solve for y in terms of x:\n\n- y = (3.40 - 0.20x) / 0.25\n- y = 13.6 - 0.8x\n\nSubstituting this expression for y into the second equation, we get:\n\n- x + (13.6 - 0.8x) = the total number of coins brought up\n- 0.2x + 13.6 = the total number of coins brought up\n\nWe want to minimize x, so we want to maximize the total number of coins brought up. The maximum value of the total number of coins brought up occurs when x is as large as possible, which is when x = 17 (since the diver can't bring a fraction of a coin). Substituting x = 17 into the equation above, we get:\n\n- 0.2(17) + 13.6 = 17.4\n\nSo the maximum number of coins brought up is 17 copper coins and 0 brass coins, which is a total of 17 coins. To get the minimum number of copper coins, we need to decrease x by 1 and increase y by 1 (since the total number of coins brought up must stay the same).

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can simplify the expression 727+728+729 as 3*728. Now, we can express three consecutive integers as (n-1), n, and (n+1). Their product is (n-1)*n*(n+1) = n^3 - n. We know that n^3 - n = 3*728. We can guess that n is close to 9, since 9^3 = 729. We can try n=9 and check if it works. 9^3 - 9 = 720, which is not equal to 3*728. We can try n=10. 10^3 - 10 = 990, which is not equal to 3*728. We can try n=8. 8^3 - 8 = 504, which is not equal to 3*728. We can try n=11. 11^3 - 11 = 1330, which is greater than 3*728. Therefore, n must be less than 11. We can try n=7. 7^3 - 7 = 336, which is not equal to 3*728. We can try n=12. 12^3 - 12 = 1728, which is greater than 3*728. Therefore, n must be less than 12. We can try n=6. 6^3 - 6 = 210, which is not equal to 3*728. We can try n=13. 13^3 - 13 = 2196, which is greater than 3*728. Therefore, n must be less than 13. We can try n=5. 5^3 - 5 = 120, which is not equal to 3*728. We can try n=14. 14^3 - 14 = 2744, which is greater than 3*728. Therefore, n must be less than 14. We can try n=4. 4^3 - 4 = 60, which is not equal to 3*728. We can try n=15. 15^3 - 15 = 3375, which is greater than 3*728. Therefore, n must be less than 15. We can try n=3. 3^3 - 3 = 24, which is not equal to 3*728. We can try n=16. 16^3 - 16 = 4080, which is greater than 3*728. Therefore, n must be less than 16. We can try n=2. 2^3 - 2 = 6, which is not equal to 3*728. We can try n=17. 17^3 - 17 = 4912, which is greater than 3*728. Therefore, n must be less than 17. We can try n=1. 1^3 - 1 = 0, which is not equal to 3*728. Therefore, there is no integer solution for n. The answer is None of the above.",

Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the worker worked for 15 days and earned a total of $90x for the entire fortnight. Then, we know that he earned a total of $87*7 + $92*7 = $1610 for the entire fortnight.

            "Pred_Rationale": "The average speed of the plane is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. Let's assume that each side of the square is of length 'd' km. Then, the total distance traveled by the plane is 4d km. \n\nThe time taken to travel each side of the square can be calculated using the formula: \n\ntime = distance / speed \n\nSo, the time taken to travel each side of the square is: \n\n- For the first side: time = d / 200 \n- For the second side: time = d / 400 \n- For the third side: time = d / 600 \n- For the fourth side: time = d / 800 \n\nThe total time taken to travel around the square is the sum of the time taken to travel each side: \n\ntotal time = d/200 + d/400 + d/600 + d/800 \n\nSimplifying this expression, we get: \n\ntotal time = (31d) / (4800) \n\nNow, we can calculate the average speed of the plane: \n\naverage speed = total distance / total time \n\naverage speed = 4d / [(31d) / (4800)] \n\nSimplifying this expression, we get: \n\naverage speed = (19200 / 31) km/hr \n\nRounding off to the nearest integer, we get: \n\naverage speed = 562 km/hr \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 562.",

Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that Alex and Jacob worked for x hours each. Then, Alex can make x/7 toys in x hours, and Jacob can make x/9 toys in x hours. \n\nWe know that they made a total of 35 toys, so we can set up an equation: \n\nx/7 + x/9 = 35 \n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides by the least common multiple of 7 and 9, which is 63: \n\n9x + 7x = 2205 \n\n16x = 2205 \n\nx = 137.8125 \n\nSince we know that both of them worked for almost similar number of hours, we can assume that they both worked for 138 hours. \n\nNow, we can find out how many toys Jacob made: \n\nJacob can make x/9 toys in x hours, so he can make 138/9 = 15.33 toys in 138 hours. \n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, we get that Jacob made 15 toys. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A.",

Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\n70x + 30y = 810\n\nTo find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased, we need to find the maximum value of x that satisfies the above equation. We can do this by solving for y in terms of x:\n\ny = (810 - 70x)/30\n\nTo maximize the number of trousers, we need to round down to the nearest integer value of x that satisfies the above equation.

So, we can simplify the above equation as: \n\n2Sx - 2S = D \n\n2S(x-1) = D \n\nx-1 = D/2S \n\nx = D/2S + 1 \n\nNow, we can substitute the values of D and S in the above equation to get the value of x. \n\nLet's assume that the distance between City A and City B is 400 km. \n\nSpeed of the two trains = Distance/Time = 400/(4-7.5) = -160 km/h (Note that the negative sign indicates that the two trains are moving towards each other) \n\nx = 400/(2*(-160)) + 1 = 1.875 hours = 1 hour 52.5 minutes \n\nSo, the two trains will cross each other at 5 am + 1 hour 52.5 minutes = 6:52.5 am \n\nRounding off to the nearest minute, we get 6:53 am. \n\nTherefore, the answer is None of the above.",

She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.) Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20",
            "Pred_Rationale": "If Amy uses a single letter to represent each type of book, she would need at least 10 letters. If she uses pairs of two different letters, she would have 10 choices for the first letter and 9 choices for the second letter (since order doesn't matter), giving her a total of 10*9/2 = 45 possible pairs. Since she needs to represent 10 types of books, the smallest number of letters she needs is the smallest number such that 45 is greater than or equal to the number of combinations of that many letters taken two at a time. This number is 9, since there are 9*8/2 = 36 combinations of 9 letters taken two at a time, but only 8*7/2 = 28 combinations of 8 letters taken two at a time. Therefore, Amy needs at least 2*9 = 18 letters to represent all 10 types of books with pairs of letters. Since 18 is greater than 10, she can use a combination of single letters and pairs of letters to represent the books. The smallest number of letters she needs is therefore the smallest number such that 10 is greater than or equal to the number of combinations of that many letters taken two at a time.

If he borrows money to pay this amount, he needs to pay back the borrowed amount plus the interest within 30 days. Let the borrowed amount be P and the interest rate be r. Then, P + Pr = $19,200. Solving for P, we get P = $19,200 / (1 + r). If he doesn't pay within 30 days, he needs to pay the full amount of $20,000. Let n be the number of days he takes to pay after 30 days. Then, the interest he needs to pay is (n/365) * r * $20,000. He can afford to borrow money if the interest he needs to pay is less than the discount he gets. Therefore, (n/365) * r * $20,000 < $800.

Therefore, it is possible to find x and y such that L(x,y) = R(x,y) or L(x,y) < R(x,y).

Multiplying both sides by 2 and rearranging, we get k^2 - 101k + 102 = 0. Factoring, we get (k-1)(k-100) = 0. Since k must be positive, we have k = 100. Therefore, the answer is E. The answer is E.",

Let's call the number of files infected only by a virus \"V\", the number of files infected only by a worm \"W\", and the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm \"B\". \n\nWe know that W = 2.5B, so we can represent this on the diagram by putting 2.5 times as many dots in the W circle as in the overlap region. \n\nWe also know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so we can represent this on the diagram by putting half as many dots in the V circle as in the non-infected region outside the rectangle. \n\nNow we can use the information given in the problem to set up some equations. \n\nFirst, we know that the total number of files is 250: \n\nV + W + B + (non-infected) = 250 \n\nWe also know that W = 2.5B: \n\nW = 2.5B \n\nAnd we know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus: \n\nV = (non-infected)/2 \n\nWe can use these equations to solve for the number of files that were not infected by a worm: \n\n(non-infected) = 250 - V - W - B \n\n(non-infected) = 250 - (non-infected)/2 - 2.5B - B \n\nSimplifying: \n\n(non-infected)/2 = 250 - 3.5B - V \n\n(non-infected)/2 = 250 - 3.5B - (non-infected)/2 \n\n(non-infected)/2 = 500 - 3.5B \n\n(non-infected) = 1000 - 7B \n\nNow we just need to find a value of B that makes (non-infected) equal to one of the answer choices. \n\nLet's try B = 10: \n\n(non-infected) = 1000 - 7(10) = 930 \n\nThis is not one of the answer choices. \n\nLet's try B = 20: \n\n(non-infected) = 1000 - 7(20) = 860 \n\nThis is not one of the answer choices. \n\nLet's try B = 30: \n\n(non-infected) = 1000 - 7(30) = 790 \n\nThis is not one of the answer choices. \n\nLet's try B = 40: \n\n(non-infected) = 1000 - 7(40) = 720 \n\nThis is not one of the answer choices. \n\nLet's try B = 50: \n\n(non-infected) = 1000 - 7(50) = 650 \n\nThis is one of the answer choices, so the answer is (D) 100.",

Therefore, in 40 grams of alloy X, there are 16 grams of zinc and 24 grams of copper.\n\nSimilarly, let's find the amount of zinc and copper in 60 grams of alloy Y. The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Y is 7:11, which does not simplify. So, out of every 18 parts of the alloy, 7 parts are zinc and 11 parts are copper.

So, our speed for this part of the journey is (S-10)/20 steps/minute. \n\nSince we are assuming that the speed of the elevator is constant, we can equate the two speeds: \n\n(S-20)/10 = (S-10)/20 \n\nSolving this equation, we get S = 60. \n\nNow, we can use either of the two conditions to find the speed of the elevator: \n\nFrom the first condition, we know that (60-20)/E + 20/E = 10 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get E = 2 steps/minute \n\nTherefore, the speed of the elevator is 2 steps/minute. \n\nThe answer is B.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can set up a proportion to solve the problem. Let x be the height of the tree. Then we have:\n\nheight of pole / length of pole shadow = height of tree / length of tree shadow\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n14 / 10 = x / 15\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 14 * 3 / 2 = 21\n\nTherefore, the height of the tree is 21 meters.

            "Question": "Q: A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The volume of the coin is the volume of a cylinder with height 2 mm and radius 7.5 mm. Thus, the volume of the coin is pi*(7.5)^2*2 = 352.5*pi mm^3. Let the volume of aluminum in the coin be V. Then the volume of silver in the coin is also V. Let the density of aluminum be d. Then the density of silver is 2d. The weight of the aluminum in the coin is V*d and the weight of the silver in the coin is V*2d. The total weight of the coin is 30 grams. Thus, we have V*d + V*2d = 30. Also, we have V + V = 352.5*pi, since the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver. Thus, V = 176.25*pi. Substituting this into the first equation, we get d = 30/(3*176.25*pi) = 0.0054 grams/mm^3. The volume of the new coin is pi*(15/2)^2*1 = 176.25*pi mm^3. The weight of the new coin is V*d = 176.25*pi*0.0054*2 = 3.8 grams. The answer is None of the above.",
