        "prompt": "You are an expert at arithmetic reasoning and are willing to solve algebraic word problems. Select the correct answer from the given options. If none of the options are correct, generate 'None of the above'. To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\n\nQ: Three friends-whose walking rates are 1 ft./sec., 3ft./sec.,and 6ft./sec. start together walking in the same direction around a circular track that is 420 feet in circumference.After how many minutes are the three of them together again? Answer Choices: (A) 5 mins (B) 10 mins (C) 15 mins (D) 3 mins (E) 7 mins\n\nA: Let's think step by step. The time they take will be what the 1st friend takes to complete one circumference as he is the slowest and that is the point all 3 of them will be together at the end of 7 mins. E The answer is E.\n\nQ: The average of 20 numbers is zero. Of them, at the most, how many may be greater than zero? Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 10 (D) 19 (E) None of the above\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Average of 20 numbers = 0. \u2234 Sum of 20 numbers = (0 \u00d7 20) = 0. It is quite possible that 19 of these numbers may be positive and if their sum is a, then 20th number is (\u2013a). Answer D The answer is D.\n\nQ: If k is an integer and 0.0010101 x 10^k is greater than 100, what is the least possible value of k? Answer Choices: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 4 (D) 5 (E) 6\n\nA: Let's think step by step. 0.0010101 * 10^k > 100 We need to move the decimal point to the right 5 places to get 101.01 This is equivalent to multiplying by 10^5. The answer is D. The answer is D.\n\nQ: Number of ways in which the letters of word PARDENS can be arranged with vowels in alphabetical order, is Answer Choices: (A) 360 (B) 240 (C) 2520 (D) 480 (E) None of these\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Solution Order of vowels of fixed \u00e2\u02c6\u00b4 required number of ways are 7!/2!. Answer C The answer is C.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
