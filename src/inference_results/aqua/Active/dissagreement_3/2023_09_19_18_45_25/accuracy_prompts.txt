        "prompt": "You are an expert at arithmetic reasoning and are willing to solve algebraic word problems. Select the correct answer from the given options. If none of the options are correct, generate 'None of the above'. To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\n\nQ: Starting with 0, a mathematician labels every non-negative integer as one of five types: alpha, beta, gamma, delta, or epsilon, in that repeating order as the integers increase. For instance, the integer 8 is labeled delta. What is the label on an integer that is the sum of an alpha raised to the seventh power and a gamma raised to the seventh power? Answer Choices: (A) alpha (B) beta (C) gamma (D) delta (E) epsilon\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nLet the alpha be 5k and let the gamma be 5j+2.\n(5k)^7 + (5j+2)^7 which has the form 5k+3, which is a gamma.\nThe answer is C. The answer is C.\n\nQ: A carpenter worked alone for 1 day on a job that would take him 5 more days to finish. He and another carpenter completed the job in 4 more days. How many days would it have taken the second carpenter to do the complete job working alone? Answer Choices: (A) 4 2/3 (B) 7 (C) 9 (D) 14 (E) 24\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nA carpenter worked only 1 day on something that takes him 5 MORE days.\nMeans;\nCarpenter finishes his work in 6 days.\nLet his buddy finish the same task in x days.\nRespective rates per day:\n1/6 AND 1/x\nTo complete 1 work:\nFirst guy worked for 5 days @ rate=1/6 per day.\nSecond one worked for 4 days @ rate=1/x per day\nExpression:\nDays*Rate=Work\n5*1/6+4*1/x=1\n5x+24=6x\nx=24 days.\nAns:E The answer is E.\n\nQ: A train 700 m long is running at a speed of 78 km/hr. If it crosses a tunnel in 1 min, then the length of the tunnel is? Answer Choices: (A) 298 m (B) 468 m (C) 600 m (D) 667 m (E) 781 m\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nSpeed = 78 * 5/18 = 65/3 m/sec.\nTime = 1 min = 60 sec.\nLet the length of the train be x meters.\nThen, (700 + x)/60 = 65/3\nx = 600 m.\nAnswer: C The answer is C.\n\nQ: A numberais squared and then multiplied by negative 3. The result of this operation T is equal to three times the sum of three timesaand two. What is one possible value ofa? Answer Choices: (A) -3 (B) -2 (C) 1 (D) 2 (E) 3\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nT=-3*a^2=3(3a+2)\na= -2 or -1\na=-2=B The answer is B.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
