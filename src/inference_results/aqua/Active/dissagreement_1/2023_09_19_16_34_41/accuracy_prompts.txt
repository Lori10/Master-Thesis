        "prompt": "You are an expert at arithmetic reasoning and are willing to solve algebraic word problems. Select the correct answer from the given options. If none of the options are correct, generate 'None of the above'. To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\n\nQ: There are two examinations rooms A and B. If 10 students are sent from A to B, then the number of students in each room is the same. If 20 candidates are sent from B to A, then the number of students in A is double the number of students in B. The number of students in room A is: Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 110 (C) 120 (D) 130 (E) 140\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nLet the number of students in rooms A and B be x and y respectively.\nThen, x - 10 = y + 10 x - y = 20 .... (i)\nand x + 20 = 2(y - 20) x - 2y = -60 .... (ii)\nSolving (i) and (ii) we get: x = 100 , y = 80.\nThe required answer A = 100. The answer is A.\n\nQ: A bullet train 140 m long is running at 60 kmph. In how much time will it pass a platform 260 m long? Answer Choices: (A) 34 Seconds (B) 22 Seconds (C) 41 Seconds (D) 24 Seconds (E) 29 Seconds\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nD\n24 Seconds\nDistance travelled = 140 + 260m = 400m\nSpeed = 60 * 5/8 = 50/3m\nTime = 400 * 3/50 = 24 Seconds The answer is D.\n\nQ: The probability that a man will be alive for 10more yrs is 1/4 & the probability that his wife will alive for 10 more yrs is 1/3. The probability that none of them will be alive for 10 more yrs, is Answer Choices: (A) 1/2 (B) 1 (C) 2/3 (D) 3/5 (E) 3/8\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nSol. Required probability = Pg.) x P(B) = (1\u2014 D x(1 \u2014I) =: x 1=1/2\nAns.(A) The answer is A.\n\nQ: On a Monday in a certain restaurant, 30 percent of the 180 customers ordered the daily special. On Tuesday, only 10 percent of the 120 customers ordered the special. For the two days combined, what percent of the customers ordered the daily special? Answer Choices: (A) 15% (B) 16% (C) 18% (D) 22% (E) 30%\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\n30% of 180= 54\n10% of 120=12\nTotal =66\npercent for 2 days combined =66/300=0.22. so it should be less than 0.22 so it is 22%\nAnswer:D The answer is D.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
