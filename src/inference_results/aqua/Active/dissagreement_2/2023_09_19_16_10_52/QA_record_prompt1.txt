            "Pred_Rationale": "We can use the formula for average speed, which is:\n\naverage speed = total distance / total time\n\nSince the plane flies along the four sides of a square, each side has the same length, let's call it \"d\". The total distance around the square is then 4d.\n\nTo find the total time, we need to find the time it takes to fly each side. We can use the formula:\n\ntime = distance / speed\n\nFor the first side, the distance is d and the speed is 200 km/hr, so the time is d/200.\n\nFor the second side, the distance is d and the speed is 400 km/hr, so the time is d/400.\n\nFor the third side, the distance is d and the speed is 600 km/hr, so the time is d/600.\n\nFor the fourth side, the distance is d and the speed is 800 km/hr, so the time is d/800.\n\nThe total time is then:\n\ntotal time = d/200 + d/400 + d/600 + d/800\n\nWe can simplify this expression by finding a common denominator:\n\ntotal time = (12d + 6d + 4d + 3d) / (2400d)\ntotal time = 25d / 2400d\ntotal time = 1/96 hr\n\nNow we can find the average speed:\n\naverage speed = total distance / total time\naverage speed = 4d / (1/96)\naverage speed = 384 km/hr\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's start by breaking down the given information:\n- M = abc is a three-digit number\n- N = cba\n- M > N\n- M - N + 396c = 990\n\nWe can rewrite M and N as:\nM = 100a + 10b + c\nN = 100c + 10b + a\n\nSubstituting these values in the equation M - N + 396c = 990, we get:\n100a + 10b + c - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990\n99a - 99c + 406c = 990\n99(a - c) = 990 - 406c\na - c = (990 - 406c)/99\n\nSince a and c are digits, a - c can only take integer values between -9 and 9. We can use this information to find the possible values of c:\n- If a - c = 9, then (990 - 406c)/99 = 9, which gives c = 2.4. But c has to be a digit, so this is not possible.\n- If a - c = 8, then (990 - 406c)/99 = 8, which gives c = 1. This is a valid solution.\n- If a - c = 7, then (990 - 406c)/99 = 7, which gives c = 3. This is a valid solution.\n- If a - c = 6, then (990 - 406c)/99 = 6, which gives c = 5. This is a valid solution.\n- If a - c = 5, then (990 - 406c)/99 = 5, which gives c = 7. This is not a valid solution, since c has to be a digit.\n- If a - c = 4, then (990 - 406c)/99 = 4, which gives c = 9. This is not a valid solution, since c has to be a digit.\n- If a - c = 3, then (990 - 406c)/99 = 3, which gives c = 2.

This is greater than 300.\n- For c = 3, we get a = 7, b = 1, and M = 731. This is greater than 300.\n- For c = 5, we get a = 5, b = 9, and M = 599.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume the length of the yard is L and the width is W.\nFrom the given information, we know that:\n- The area of the yard is 240 square meters, so LW = 240.\n- Alice wants to fence three sides of the yard, which means she needs to fence two lengths and one width. The length of the unfenced side is 10 meters, so the total length of the three sides that need fencing is 2L + W - 10.\nWe can use these two equations to solve for L and W:\nLW = 240\n2L + W - 10 = perimeter\nWe can simplify the second equation by using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:\n2L + 2W = perimeter + 10\n2(L + W) = perimeter + 10\nL + W = (perimeter + 10)/2\nNow we can substitute LW = 240 into the simplified equation:\nL + W = (perimeter + 10)/2\nLW = 240\nL = 240/W\n240/W + W = (perimeter + 10)/2\nMultiplying both sides by 2W, we get:\n480 + W^2 = perimeterW + 10W\nRearranging and simplifying, we get a quadratic equation:\nW^2 - (perimeter - 10)W + 480 = 0\nWe can solve for W using the quadratic formula:\nW = [perimeter - 10 \u00b1 sqrt((perimeter - 10)^2 - 4(480))]/2\nWe know that W is a positive integer, so we can use this fact to eliminate one of the solutions:\nW = [perimeter - 10 + sqrt((perimeter - 10)^2 - 4(480))]/2\nW = [perimeter - 10 + sqrt(perimeter^2 - 20perimeter + 100 - 1920)]/2\nW = [perimeter - 10 + sqrt(perimeter^2 - 20perimeter - 1820)]/2\nNow we can try each answer choice for the value of perimeter until we find one that gives a positive integer value for W. We can start with answer choice A:\nW = [58 - 10 + sqrt(58^2 - 20(58) - 1820)]/2\nW = [48 + sqrt(3364)]/2\nW = [48 + 58]/2\nW = 53\nThis is a positive integer value for W, so we have found the correct value of perimeter. Now we just need to calculate the total length of fencing needed:\n2L + W - 10 = 2(240/W) + 53 - 10 = 480/W + 43\nPerimeter = 2L + 2W = 2(240/W) + 2(53) = 480/W + 106\nTotal length of fencing = 480/W + 43 + 106 - 10 = 480/W + 139\nPlugging in W = 53, we get:\nTotal length of fencing = 480/53 + 139 \u2248 62.02\nSo the answer is B.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can use the formula for compound interest: \n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nwhere A is the final amount, P is the principal (initial amount), r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n\nIn this case, P = $5,000, r = 12%, n = 2 (compounded every six months), and t = 1 year. \n\nFirst, we need to find the amount of each compounding period:\n\nA = $5,000(1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1) = $5,000(1.06)^2 = $5,637.20\n\nSo after one year, the bond has accrued $5,637.20 - $5,000 = $637.20 in interest.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the amount of interest accrued at maturity, which means we need to subtract the initial investment of $5,000:\n\n$637.20 - $5,000 = -$4,362.80\n\nThis doesn't make sense - it means Jerry lost money on the bond! \n\nWe can check our work by using a different formula for compound interest:\n\nA = P(1 + r)^t\n\nwhere t is the total number of years. \n\nUsing this formula, we get:\n\nA = $5,000(1 + 0.12)^1 = $5,600\n\nSo after one year, the bond has accrued $5,600 - $5,000 = $600 in interest.\n\nTherefore, the answer is E. $200.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "We are given that the perimeter of the rectangular plot is 340 meters. Let's assume that the length of the rectangular plot is L and the breadth is B. \n\nPerimeter of the rectangular plot = 2(L + B) = 340 \n\nL + B = 170 \n\nWe need to find the cost of gardening 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot. \n\nThe length of the rectangular plot with the boundary will be (L + 2) and the breadth will be (B + 2). \n\nThe area of the rectangular plot with the boundary = (L + 2) \u00d7 (B + 2) \n\n= LB + 2L + 2B + 4 \n\nWe know that L + B = 170 \n\nLB = L(170 - L) \n\n= 170L - L^2 \n\nArea of the rectangular plot with the boundary = 170L - L^2 + 2L + 2B + 4 \n\n= 170L - L^2 + 2(170 - L) + 4 \n\n= -L^2 + 172L + 4 \n\n= -1(L^2 - 172L - 4) \n\n= -1(L^2 - 2 \u00d7 (86)L + 86^2 - 86^2 - 4) \n\n= -1[(L - 86)^2 - 7396 - 4] \n\n= -1[(L - 86)^2 - 7400] \n\n= -1(L - 86)^2 + 7400 \n\nTherefore, the area of the rectangular plot with the boundary is (-1(L - 86)^2 + 7400) square meters. \n\nThe cost of gardening 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot at the rate of 10 per square meter = 10 \u00d7 (-1(L - 86)^2 + 7400) \n\n= -10(L - 86)^2 + 74000 \n\nSince we do not know the value of L, we cannot determine the exact cost of gardening. \n\nThe answer is (D) Cannot be determined.",

The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5(\u221a3 + 1)  (B) 6(\u221a3 + \u221a2)  (C) 7(\u221a3 \u2013 1)  (D) 8(\u221a3 \u2013 2)  (E) None of these",

This means that the car travels a distance of x + d in 10 minutes at a uniform speed.\n\nWe can use the formula:\n\ndistance = speed \u00d7 time\n\nto get:\n\nx + d = speed \u00d7 10\n\nWe can also use the formula for the tangent of the difference of two angles to get:\n\ntan(\u03b82 - \u03b81) = (h/(x + d)) - (h/x) = hxd/(x(x + d)(h^2 + x^2 + 2xdh))\n\nWe know that tan(\u03b82 - \u03b81) = tan(60\u00b0 - 45\u00b0) = \u221a3 - 1.\n\nSubstituting the given values and simplifying, we get:\n\n(\u221a3 - 1) = hxd/(x(x + d)(h^2 + x^2 + 2xdh))\n\nSolving for d, we get:\n\nd = h(\u221a3 - 1)/(2\u221a3 + 1)\n\nWe are asked to find the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower, which is the time it takes for the car to travel a distance of x + d at a uniform speed. We know that:\n\nx + d = speed \u00d7 time\n\nSubstituting the value of d, we get:\n\nx + h(\u221a3 - 1)/(2\u221a3 + 1) = speed \u00d7 time\n\nWe need to eliminate speed to get the answer in terms of h and x. We can use the fact that the average speed of the car during the entire journey is:\n\naverage speed = total distance / total time\n\nThe total distance is x + d + x = 2x + h(\u221a3 - 1)/(2\u221a3 + 1), and the total time is 10 minutes + the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower.\n\nThe average speed is the uniform speed at which the car is traveling. We can equate the two expressions for average speed to get:\n\nspeed = (2x + h(\u221a3 - 1)/(2\u221a3 + 1)) / (10 + time)\n\nSubstituting this value of speed in the equation for x + d, we get:\n\nx + h(\u221a3 - 1)/(2\u221a3 + 1) = (2x + h(\u221a3 - 1)/(2\u221a3 + 1)) / (10 + time) \u00d7 time\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\ntime^2 + (20 + h(\u221a3 - 1)/(2\u221a3 + 1)) \u00d7 time - 2x(2\u221a3 + 1) = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\ntime = (-20 - h(\u221a3 - 1)/(2\u221a3 + 1) \u00b1 \u221a(400 + h^2(\u221a3 - 1)^2/(2\u221a3 + 1)^2 + 8x(2\u221a3 + 1))) / 2\n\nWe can simplify this expression using the fact that h/x = tan(\u03b81) = tan(45\u00b0) = 1:\n\ntime = (-20 - h(\u221a3 - 1)/(2\u221a3 + 1) \u00b1 \u221a(400 + h^2(\u221a3 - 1)^2/(2\u221a3 + 1)^2 + 8hx(2\u221a3 + 1))) / 2\n\nNone of the given answer choices match this expression, so the answer is None of these.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's find the amount of zinc and copper in alloy X and Y separately.\n\nIn alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which can be simplified to 2:3. So, for every 2 parts of zinc, there are 3 parts of copper. Therefore, the amount of zinc and copper in 40 grams of alloy X are:\n\nZinc = (2/5) * 40 = 16 grams\nCopper = (3/5) * 40 = 24 grams\n\nIn alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which cannot be simplified. So, for every 7 parts of zinc, there are 11 parts of copper. Therefore, the amount of zinc and copper in 60 grams of alloy Y are:\n\nZinc = (7/18) * 60 = 23.33 grams (approx.)\nCopper = (11/18) * 60 = 36.67 grams (approx.)\n\nNow, let's find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z:\n\nTotal Zinc = 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams (approx.)\nTotal Copper = 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams (approx.)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:\n\n39.33:60.67, which can be simplified to 59:91.\n\nThe answer is D.",
