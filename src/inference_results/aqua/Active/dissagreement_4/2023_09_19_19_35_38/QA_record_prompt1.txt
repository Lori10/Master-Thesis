For which of the following values of x and y is it impossible that p = q? Answer Choices: (A) x = 2 and y = 6 (B) x = 3 and y = 6 (C) x = 7 and y = 9 (D) x = 10 and y = 7 (E) x = 10 and y = 4\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nI approached this in a different way, although may be longer but it's certainly more intuitive\nIt is impossible that p = q if one of them is necessarily even while the other is necessarily odd\nfor two consecutive integers the sum is necessarily odd\nfor six consecutive integers the sum is necessarily odd (sum of 3two consecutive integers which are all odd)\nThus A is incorrect.\nThe sum of 3 consecutive integers can be even or odd (an odd integer from the first 2 + an additional integer which can be even or odd). Thus B is incorrect. You can do a similar approach for C and D (it follows that the sum of a specified odd number of consecutive integers can be odd or even).\nLeaving us with E to be the only not-wrong answer. To confirm, you can easily deduce that the sum of 4 consecutive integers (sum of 2 odd integers) is necessarily even while the sum of 10 consecutive integers (sum of 5 odd integers) is necessarily odd. Thus E is the right answer. The answer is E.\n\nQ: courtyard 3.78 meters long 5.95 meters wide is to be paved exactly with square tiles, all of the same size. what is the largest size of the tile which could be used for the purpose?

We can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nFor the first side, the time taken is d/200. For the second side, the time taken is d/400. For the third side, the time taken is d/600. For the fourth side, the time taken is d/800.

Let's assume that the difference in their working hours is d.\nSo, we can represent their working hours as (17/2 - d) and (17/2 + d).\nWe can set up an equation using the above information as follows:\n7(17/2 - d)x + 9(17/2 + d)y = Total number of hours worked\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n7(17 - 2d)x + 9(17 + 2d)y = 2 * Total number of hours worked\nSubstituting x + y = 35, we get:\n7(17 - 2d)x + 9(17 + 2d)(35 - x) = 2 * Total number of hours worked\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n16x - 7d = 17 * 35\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = (17 * 35 + 7d)/16\nSince x is an integer, 7d must be a multiple of 16 less than 17 * 35.\nThe only value of d that satisfies this condition is d = 7.\nSubstituting d = 7 in the above equation, we get:\nx = 15\nSo, Alex made 15 toys and Jacob made 20 toys.\nAnswer: None of the above (as none of the answer choices match the correct answer of 20)",

Therefore, we can set up the inequality:\n(Total % of students who took physics or math) * x / 100 > 501\nSubstituting the values we have:\n(20% + 28% - y%) * x / 100 > 501\n48% - y% > 501 / x\nSince y% cannot be negative, we can assume the minimum value of y% to be 0. Therefore, we have:\n48% > 501 / x\nx > 501 / 0.48\nx > 1043.75\nThe least possible value of x that satisfies this inequality is 1044.\nTherefore, the answer is (E) none of these, since none of the answer choices include 1044.",

At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day? Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the number of yellow golf balls be y. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, the number of white golf balls sold is also y. Therefore, the total number of golf balls sold is 2y. \n\nSince the store sold 80% of its inventory, it had 20% remaining at the end of the day. This means that 0.2(600) = 120 golf balls remained. \n\nSince the store sold all of its white golf balls, the number of white golf balls remaining is 0. Therefore, the number of yellow golf balls remaining is 120. \n\nTherefore, the store had y + 120 = 600 - 2y yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day. \n\nSolving for y, we get y = 240. \n\nTherefore, the store had 240 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day. \n\nAnswer: C",

            "Question": "Q: Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need? Answer Choices: (A) 58 (B) 62 (C) 66 (D) 70 (E) 74",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume the length of the yard is L and the width is W. We know that the area of the yard is 240 square meters, so we have:\n\nL \u00d7 W = 240\n\nWe also know that Alice wants to fence three sides of the yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. Since the unfenced side is the width of the yard, we have:\n\nL + 2W = perimeter of the fenced area\n\nBut we know that one side is unfenced, so we need to subtract 10 meters from the perimeter:\n\nL + 2W - 10 = perimeter of the fenced area\n\nNow we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle to get:\n\n2L + 2W - 10 = perimeter of the fenced area\n\nWe can simplify this to:\n\n2(L + W) - 10 = perimeter of the fenced area\n\nBut we know that the perimeter of the fenced area is the length of fencing that Alice needs, so we have:\n\n2(L + W) - 10 = length of fencing\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables:\n\nL \u00d7 W = 240\n2(L + W) - 10 = length of fencing\n\nWe can use substitution to solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve the first equation for L:\n\nL = 240 \u00f7 W\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for L into the second equation:\n\n2(240 \u00f7 W + W) - 10 = length of fencing\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n480 \u00f7 W + 2W - 10 = length of fencing\n\nMultiplying both sides by W, we get:\n\n480 + 2W\u00b2 - 10W = length of fencing \u00d7 W\n\nNow we have an equation with only one variable, W. We can solve for W using the quadratic formula:\n\nW = [10 \u00b1 sqrt(100 + 1920 \u00f7 length of fencing)] \u00f7 4\n\nSince W is the width of the yard, it must be less than 10 meters. Therefore, we can eliminate the positive root of the quadratic equation:\n\nW = [10 - sqrt(100 + 1920 \u00f7 length of fencing)] \u00f7 4\n\nNow we can use this expression for W to solve for the length of fencing:\n\nlength of fencing = 2(L + W) - 10\nlength of fencing = 2(240 \u00f7 W + W) - 10\nlength of fencing = 480 \u00f7 W + 2W - 10\nlength of fencing = 480 \u00f7 [10 - sqrt(100 + 1920 \u00f7 length of fencing)] + 2[10 - sqrt(100 + 1920 \u00f7 length of fencing)] - 10\n\nThis equation is a bit messy, but we can solve it using algebraic manipulation. First, we can simplify the expression inside the square root:\n\n100 + 1920 \u00f7 length of fencing = 100(length of fencing \u00f7 19 + 19)\n\nNow we can substitute this expression into the equation for length of fencing:\n\nlength of fencing = 480 \u00f7 [10 - sqrt(100(length of fencing \u00f7 19 + 19))] + 2[10 - sqrt(100(length of fencing \u00f7 19 + 19))] - 10\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nlength of fencing = 480 \u00f7 [10 - 10sqrt(length of fencing \u00f7 19 + 1)] + 20 - 2sqrt(length of fencing \u00f7 19 + 1)\n\nNow we can solve for length of fencing using trial and error. We can start by plugging in answer choice A:\n\nlength of fencing = 58\n\nPlugging this value into the equation, we get:\n\n58 = 480 \u00f7 [10 - 10sqrt(58 \u00f7 19 + 1)] + 20 - 2sqrt(58 \u00f7 19 + 1)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n58 = 480 \u00f7 3.8 + 20 - 2.2\n\n58 = 125.3\n\nThis is clearly not true, so we can eliminate answer choice A. We can continue this process with the remaining answer choices until we find the correct value for length of fencing.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a graphing calculator to graph the equation:\n\nlength of fencing = 480 \u00f7 [10 - 10sqrt(length of fencing \u00f7 19 + 1)] + 20 - 2sqrt(length of fencing \u00f7 19 + 1)\n\nThen we can find the x-intercept of the graph, which will give us the correct value for length of fencing.",

If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 28 (C) 30 (D) 53 (E) 59",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's first find out how many times the number of water lilies will double to cover the lake starting from one lily. Since the number of lilies doubles every two days, after 60 days, the number of lilies will have doubled 30 times (since 60/2 = 30). \n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where there are 64 lilies to start with. We want to find out how many days it will take for the lake to be fully covered with lilies. Since the number of lilies doubles every two days, we can set up the equation:\n\n64 x 2^n = total number of lilies on the lake\n\nwhere n is the number of times the number of lilies doubles. We know that when the lake is fully covered, the total number of lilies will be some power of 2 (since the number of lilies doubles each time). Let's call this power of 2 \"x\". Then we have:\n\n2^x = total number of lilies on the lake\n\nSince we know that the total number of lilies on the lake is equal to 64 x 2^n, we can set these two equations equal to each other:\n\n2^x = 64 x 2^n\n\nWe can simplify this equation by writing 64 as 2^6:\n\n2^x = 2^6 x 2^n\n\nUsing the rule that when you multiply powers with the same base, you add the exponents, we get:\n\n2^x = 2^(6+n)\n\nSince the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:\n\nx = 6 + n\n\nWe know that when the lake is fully covered, the total number of lilies will be a power of 2. We found earlier that the number of times the number of lilies doubles to cover the lake starting from one lily is 30. Therefore, the total number of lilies on the lake when it is fully covered is:\n\n2^30 = 1,073,741,824\n\nWe can use this number to solve for x:\n\n2^x = 1,073,741,824\n\nTaking the logarithm of both sides (with base 2), we get:\n\nx = log2(1,073,741,824)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that x is approximately 30. Therefore, the number of times the number of lilies doubles starting from 64 lilies is:\n\nn = 30 - 6 = 24\n\nSince the number of lilies doubles every two days, the number of days it will take for the lake to be fully covered starting from 64 lilies is:\n\n2 x 24 = 48\n\nTherefore, the lake will be fully covered with lilies in 48 days.\n\nAnswer: None of the above (since the closest answer choice is C, but it is not correct).",

The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 10% (C) 12.5% (D) 16.7% (E) 25%",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the cost of repairing the current tire is $x. \n\nSo, the cost of repairing the tire for 4 years would be $4x. \n\nThe cost of purchasing a new tire is $180. \n\nSince the tire lasts for 4 years, the average cost per year of the new tire would be $180/4 = $45. \n\nIf the customer chooses to repair the current tire, the cost per year would be ($4x + $40)/5 = ($4x/5) + $8. \n\nTo find the percentage difference between the two costs, we can use the formula: \n\n[(New cost - Old cost)/Old cost] x 100 \n\nSubstituting the values, we get: \n\n[(45 - ((4x/5) + 8))/((4x/5) + 8)] x 100 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n[(37 - 4x/5)/((4x/5) + 8)] x 100 \n\n[(185 - 4x)/((4x + 40)/5)] x 100 \n\n[(185 - 4x) x 5/(4x + 40)] x 100 \n\n(925 - 20x)/(4x + 40) x 100 \n\nNow, we can substitute some values of x to find the percentage difference. \n\nLet's assume x = 20. \n\nSubstituting, we get: \n\n(925 - 20(20))/(4(20) + 40) x 100 \n\n(925 - 400)/120 x 100 \n\n525/120 x 100 \n\n4.375 x 100 = 437.5% \n\nTherefore, the answer is not among the answer choices.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume Joe's age to be x, his sister's age to be y, and his father's age to be z.\nFrom the first statement, we have:\nx + y + z = 100\nFrom the second statement, we know that when Joe is as old as his father, his sister will be twice as old as now. Let's assume that this age is a years away from now. So, we have:\ny + a = 2(x + a)\ny + a = 2x + 2a\ny - 2x = a\nFrom the third statement, we know that when Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Let's assume that this age is b years away from now. So, we have:\nz + b = 2(y + b)\nz + b = 2y + 2b\nz - 2y = b\nNow, we have three equations with three variables.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can solve this problem using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nsum = (number of terms) \u00d7 (average of terms)\n\nSince we are dealing with consecutive integers, the average of terms is simply the middle term. Let's call the number of terms k and the middle term m. Then we have:\n\nsum = k \u00d7 m = 51\nm = -50 + (k + 1)/2\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first, we get:\n\nk \u00d7 (-50 + (k + 1)/2) = 51\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nk^2 - 99k + 102 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nk = (99 \u00b1 sqrt(99^2 - 4\u00d7102))/2\nk = (99 \u00b1 sqrt(9603))/2\n\nSince k must be a positive integer, we take the positive root:\n\nk = (99 + sqrt(9603))/2 \u2248 82.02\n\nTherefore, the answer is k = 82.
