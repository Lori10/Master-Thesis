If none of the options are correct, generate 'None of the above'. To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\n\nQ: Two trains are running at 40 km/h and 20 km/h respectively in the same direction. Fast train completely passes a man sitting in the slower train in 5 seconds. What is the length of the fast train? Answer Choices: (A) 23 m (B) 23 2\u20449 m (C) 27 m (D) 27 7\u20449 m (E) None of these\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nRelative speed = (40 \u2013 20) km/h\n= (20 \u00d7 5\u204418) m/sec = (50\u20449) m/sec\nLength of faster train\n= (50\u20449 \u00d7 5) m = 250\u20449m = 277\u20449 m\nAnswer D The answer is D.\n\nQ: If p is the sum of x consecutive positive integers. q is the sum of y consecutive positive integers. For which of the following values of x and y is it impossible that p = q? Answer Choices: (A) x = 2 and y = 6 (B) x = 3 and y = 6 (C) x = 7 and y = 9 (D) x = 10 and y = 7 (E) x = 10 and y = 4\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nI approached this in a different way, although may be longer but it's certainly more intuitive\nIt is impossible that p = q if one of them is necessarily even while the other is necessarily odd\nfor two consecutive integers the sum is necessarily odd\nfor six consecutive integers the sum is necessarily odd (sum of 3two consecutive integers which are all odd)\nThus A is incorrect.\nThe sum of 3 consecutive integers can be even or odd (an odd integer from the first 2 + an additional integer which can be even or odd). Thus B is incorrect. You can do a similar approach for C and D (it follows that the sum of a specified odd number of consecutive integers can be odd or even).\nLeaving us with E to be the only not-wrong answer. To confirm, you can easily deduce that the sum of 4 consecutive integers (sum of 2 odd integers) is necessarily even while the sum of 10 consecutive integers (sum of 5 odd integers) is necessarily odd. Thus E is the right answer. The answer is E.\n\nQ: courtyard 3.78 meters long 5.95 meters wide is to be paved exactly with square tiles, all of the same size. what is the largest size of the tile which could be used for the purpose? Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 77 (C) 877 (D) 99 (E) 88\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\n3.78 meters =378 cm = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7\n5.25 meters=525 cm = 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7\nHence common factors are 3 and 7\nHence LCM = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\nHence largest size of square tiles that can be paved exactly with square tiles is 77 cm.\nAnswer:B The answer is B.\n\nQ: By selling 300 apples a seller gains the selling price of 60 apples. The gain percent of the seller is Answer Choices: (A) 22 (B) 88 (C) 25 (D) 27 (E) 19\n\nA: Let's think step by step.\nExplanation:\nWe know that SP \u2212 CP = Profit\n\u21d2300SP - 300CP = 60SP\n\u21d2240SP = 300CP\n\u21d2 SPCP=300240SPCP=300240 = 5454\nLet SP = 5, and CP = 4\nSo profit percentage = 14\u00d7100=25%\nAnswer: C The answer is C.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
