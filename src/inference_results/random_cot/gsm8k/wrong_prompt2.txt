{'prompt': "Q: John writes 20 pages a day.  How long will it take him to write 3 books that are 400 pages each?\nA: Let's think step by step.\n'He wants to write 3*400=<<3*400=1200>>1200 pages\nSo it will take him 1200/20=<<1200/20=60>>60 days The answer is 60.\n\nQ: Mr. Sanchez found out that 40% of his Grade 5  students got a final grade below B. How many of his students got a final grade of B and above if he has 60 students in Grade 5?\nA: Let's think step by step.\n'Since 40% of his students got below B, 100% - 40% = 60% of Mr. Sanchez's students got B and above.\nThus, 60 x 60/100 = <<60*60/100=36>>36 students got B and above in their final grade. The answer is 36.\n\nQ: Noah is a painter. He paints pictures and sells them at the park. He charges $60 for a large painting and $30 for a small painting. Last month he sold eight large paintings and four small paintings. If he sold twice as much this month, how much is his sales for this month?\nA: Let's think step by step.\n'Noah earned $60/large painting x 8 large paintings = $<<60*8=480>>480 for the large paintings.\nHe also earned $30/small painting x 4 small paintings = $<<30*4=120>>120 for the small paintings.\nHis total sales last month were $480 + $120 = $<<480+120=600>>600.\nSo, his sales this month are $600 x 2 = $<<600*2=1200>>1200. The answer is 1200.\n\n"}
