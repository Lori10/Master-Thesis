        "prompt": "Q: Sam and Jeff had a skipping competition at recess. The competition was split into four rounds. Sam completed 1 more skip than Jeff in the first round. Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam in the second round. Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam in the third round. Jeff got tired and only completed half the number of skips as Sam in the last round. If Sam skipped 16 times in each round, what is the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nIn round one, Jeff completed 16 - 1 = <<16-1=15>>15.\nIn round two, Jeff completed 16 - 3 = <<16-3=13>>13.\nIn round three, Jeff completed 16 + 4 = <<16+4=20>>20.\nIn round four, Jeff completed 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8.\nJeff completed 15 + 13 + 20 + 8 = <<15+13+20+8=56>>56 skips in total.\nJeff skipped an average of 56 / 4 = <<56/4=14>>14 skips per round. The answer is 14.\n\nQ: Joy can read 8 pages of a book in 20 minutes. How many hours will it take her to read 120 pages?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nIn one hour, there are 3 sets of 20 minutes.\nSo, Joy can read 8 x 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 pages in an hour.\nIt will take her 120/24 = <<120/24=5>>5 hours to read 120 pages. The answer is 5.\n\nQ: Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nMaila read 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 pages today.\nSo she was able to read a total of 12 + 24 = <<12+24=36>>36 pages since yesterday.\nThere are 120 - 36 = <<120-36=84>>84 pages left to be read.\nSince she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, then she should read 84/2 = <<84/2=42>>42 pages. The answer is 42.\n\nQ: John writes 20 pages a day.  How long will it take him to write 3 books that are 400 pages each?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nHe wants to write 3*400=<<3*400=1200>>1200 pages\nSo it will take him 1200/20=<<1200/20=60>>60 days The answer is 60.\n\nQ: Mr. Sanchez found out that 40% of his Grade 5  students got a final grade below B. How many of his students got a final grade of B and above if he has 60 students in Grade 5?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nSince 40% of his students got below B, 100% - 40% = 60% of Mr. Sanchez's students got B and above.\nThus, 60 x 60/100 = <<60*60/100=36>>36 students got B and above in their final grade. The answer is 36.\n\n",

        "prompt": "Q: Noah is a painter. He paints pictures and sells them at the park. He charges $60 for a large painting and $30 for a small painting. Last month he sold eight large paintings and four small paintings. If he sold twice as much this month, how much is his sales for this month?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nNoah earned $60/large painting x 8 large paintings = $<<60*8=480>>480 for the large paintings.\nHe also earned $30/small painting x 4 small paintings = $<<30*4=120>>120 for the small paintings.\nHis total sales last month were $480 + $120 = $<<480+120=600>>600.\nSo, his sales this month are $600 x 2 = $<<600*2=1200>>1200. The answer is 1200.\n\nQ: There are 5 houses on a street, and each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes in the garden. If there are a total of 20 gnomes on the street, how many gnomes does the fifth house have?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nIn the first four houses, there are a total of 4 houses * 3 gnomes = <<4*3=12>>12 gnomes.\nTherefore, the fifth house had 20 total gnomes \u2013 12 gnomes = <<20-12=8>>8 gnomes. The answer is 8.\n\nQ: In a truck, there are 26 pink hard hats, 15 green hard hats, and 24 yellow hard hats.  If Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats, and John takes away 6 pink hard hats and twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats that he removed, then calculate the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck.\nA: Let's think step by step.\nIf there were 26 pink hard hats and Carl took away 4 pink hard hats, the number of pink hard hats that remained is 26-4 = <<26-4=22>>22\nJohn also took away 6 pink hard hats, leaving 22-6 = <<22-6=16>>16 pink hard hats in the truck.\nIf John also took twice as many green hard hats as pink hard hats, he took 2*6 = <<6*2=12>>12 green hard hats.\nThe total number of green hard hats that remained in the truck is 15-12 = <<15-12=3>>3\nIn the truck, after some are taken, there were 3 green hard hats + 16 pink hard hats = <<3+16=19>>19 hard hats in the truck.\nAltogether, 19 green and pink hard hats + 24 yellow hards hats = <<19+24=43>>43 hard hats remained in the truck The answer is 43.\n\nQ: John writes 20 pages a day.  How long will it take him to write 3 books that are 400 pages each?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nHe wants to write 3*400=<<3*400=1200>>1200 pages\nSo it will take him 1200/20=<<1200/20=60>>60 days The answer is 60.\n\nQ: Jasper will serve charcuterie at his dinner party. He buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10, a pound of cream cheese that cost half the price of the cheddar cheese, and a pack of cold cuts that cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese.
