        "prompt": "You are an expert at arithmetic reasoning and are willing to solve grade school math problems. Follow the format of the examples below:\nQ: Ken created a care package to send to his brother, who was away at boarding school.  Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.  Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple.  Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans.  And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again.  What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds?\nA:\n Let's think step by step.\nTo the initial 2 pounds of jelly beans, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple, bringing the weight to 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 pounds.\nNext, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans, bringing the weight to 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 pounds.\nAnd finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again, to a final weight of 8*2=<<8*2=16>>16 pounds. The answer is 16.\n\n\n\nQ: Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?\nA:\n Let's think step by step.\nLet S be the amount Alexis paid for the shoes.\nShe spent S + 30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 = S + <<+30+46+38+11+18=143>>143.\nShe used all but $16 of her budget, so S + 143 = 200 - 16 = 184.\nThus, Alexis paid S = 184 - 143 = $<<184-143=41>>41 for the shoes. The answer is 41.\n\n\n\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
