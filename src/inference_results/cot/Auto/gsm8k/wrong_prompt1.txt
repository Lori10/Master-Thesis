{'prompt': 'You are an expert at arithmetic reasoning and are willing to solve grade school math problems. To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\nQ: Ben has 8 apples more than Phillip does. Tom has three eighths as many apples at Ben has. If Phillip has 40 apples, how many apples does Tom have?\nA: Let\'s think step by step.\nBen has 40+8 = <<40+8=48>>48 apples.\nThere are 48/8 = <<48/8=6>>6 apples in every eighth.\nTom has 6*3 = <<6*3=18>>18 apples. The answer is 18.\n\nQ: There have been 15 "Where\'s Waldo?" books published. Each book has 30 puzzles to find Waldo. The average person takes 3 minutes to find Waldo in a puzzle. How long would it take to find every Waldo?\nA: Let\'s think step by step.\nThere have been 450 puzzles because 15 x 30 = <<450=450>>450\nIt would take 1,350 minutes to find all the Waldo\'s because 450 x 3 = <<450*3=1350>>1,350 The answer is 1350.\n\nQ: Darla needs to pay $4/watt of electricity for 300 watts of electricity, plus a $150 late fee. How much does she pay in total?\nA: Let\'s think step by step.\nFirst find the total cost of the electricity: $4/watt * 300 watts = $<<4*300=1200>>1200\nThen add the late fee: $1200 + $150 = $<<1200+150=1350>>1350 The answer is 1350.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let\'s think step by step.'}
