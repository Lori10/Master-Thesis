If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500",

So, the total number of tagged deer in the forest before the 500 were caught in 2002 is 300.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values we know:\n\n(20 / 500) = (300 + x) / (5000 + x)\n\nwhere x is the total number of untagged deer in the forest.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n20(5000 + x) = 500(300 + x)\n100000 + 20x = 15000 + 500x\n480x = 85000\nx \u2248 177.08\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a deer, we round up to 178. Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is:\n\n300 + 178 + 5000 = 5488\n\nAnswer: None of the above (closest option is D, but the exact answer is not given)",

What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 81 (C) 90 (D) 99 (E) 110",
            "Pred_Rationale": "We can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to solve this problem. \n\nLet A be the set of students who attended the prom night, and B be the set of students who took part in the debating session. Then, the number of students who attended at least one of these events is given by:\n\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\n\nWe know that |A| \u2265 45% of 200 = 90, and |B| \u2265 35% of 200 = 70. Therefore, \n\n|A \u222a B| \u2265 90 + 70 - 200 = -40\n\nThis doesn't make sense, since the number of students who attended at least one event cannot be negative. So, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. \n\nThe mistake is that we assumed that there are no students who attended both events. However, this is not necessarily true. In fact, the number of students who attended both events could be as high as the minimum of |A| and |B|. \n\nLet k be the number of students who attended both events. Then, we have:\n\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - k\n\nSince |A| \u2265 90 and |B| \u2265 70, we have:\n\n|A \u222a B| \u2265 90 + 70 - k = 160 - k\n\nWe want to find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session. This is the same as finding the minimum number of students who attended at least one event. Therefore, we want to minimize |A \u222a B|. \n\nSince |A \u222a B| \u2265 160 - k, we want to minimize k. The minimum value of k is 0 (if no students attended both events), and the maximum value of k is the minimum of |A| and |B|. Therefore, the maximum value of |A \u222a B| is:\n\n|A \u222a B| \u2264 90 + 70 - 0 = 160\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is:\n\n200 - 160 = 40\n\nAnswer: None of the above (since none of the answer choices are equal to 40).",

If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 28 (C) 30 (D) 53 (E) 59",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's first find out how many times the number of water lilies needs to double to go from 1 to 64. \n\n64 = 2^n where n is the number of times the lilies double. \n\nTaking the log base 2 of both sides: \n\nlog2(64) = log2(2^n) \n\n6 = n \n\nSo the number of times the lilies double is 6. \n\nNow we need to find out how many days it takes for the lilies to double 6 times. \n\nSince the lilies double every 2 days, we can use the formula: \n\nt = 2^n * t0 \n\nwhere t is the time it takes for the lilies to double n times, and t0 is the initial time it takes for the lilies to double. \n\nPlugging in the values: \n\nt = 2^6 * 2 = 128 days \n\nSo it takes 128 days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies if initially there were 64 water lilies on it. \n\nAnswer: None of the above (since none of the answer choices match 128 days).",

Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the bag initially had Q white marbles. \n\nIn the first 20 draws, let's say k marbles were painted black and put back in the bag.

So, the bag now has Q + k + 19 marbles, out of which k + 1 are black. \n\nWe are given that the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can solve this problem using Fibonacci series. Let F(n) be the number of ways to reach the nth step. To reach the nth step, the boy can either take one step from the (n-1)th step or two steps from the (n-2)th step. Therefore, F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2). We know that F(1) = 1 and F(2) = 2 (the boy can either take two steps from the first step or take one step twice). Using these initial values, we can calculate F(3) = 3, F(4) = 5, F(5) = 8, and so on. \n\nTo find the number of ways to reach the 10th step, we need to calculate F(10). Using the above formula and the initial values, we get:\n\nF(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 2 + 1 = 3\nF(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 3 + 2 = 5\nF(5) = F(4) + F(3) = 5 + 3 = 8\nF(6) = F(5) + F(4) = 8 + 5 = 13\nF(7) = F(6) + F(5) = 13 + 8 = 21\nF(8) = F(7) + F(6) = 21 + 13 = 34\nF(9) = F(8) + F(7) = 34 + 21 = 55\nF(10) = F(9) + F(8) = 55 + 34 = 89\n\nTherefore, there are 89 ways for the boy to reach the top of the stairs.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the speed of the elevator is x steps/minute and the total number of steps in the staircase is y.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can write:\n\n(y - 20)/x + 10 = time taken to reach the bottom\n\nFrom the second statement, we can write:\n\n(y - 10)/x + 20 = time taken to reach the ground\n\nSimplifying both equations, we get:\n\ny/x = 30 - 2t ...(1)\n\ny/x = 50 - 3t ...(2)\n\nwhere t is the time taken to cover 10 steps.\n\nEquating both equations, we get:\n\n30 - 2t = 50 - 3t\n\nt = 20\n\nSubstituting t in equation (1), we get:\n\ny/x = 10\n\nTherefore, the speed of the elevator is x/y = 1/10 steps/minute.\n\nAnswer: A The answer is A.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can solve this problem using the concept of similar triangles. Let the height of the tree be x meters. Then, we have:\n\nheight of pole / length of pole shadow = height of tree / length of tree shadow\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n14 / 10 = x / 15\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx = 14 * 3 / 2 = 21\n\nTherefore, the height of the tree is 21 meters.

            "Question": "Q: A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The volume of the coin is \u03c0r^2h = \u03c0(7.5)^2(2) = 352.5\u03c0 mm^3. Let the volume of aluminum in the coin be V. Since the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, the volume of silver in the coin is also V. Let the density of aluminum be d. Then the weight of the aluminum in the coin is Vd. Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of the silver in the coin is 2Vd. The total weight of the coin is 30 grams, so we have:\n\nVd + 2Vd = 30\n3Vd = 30\nVd = 10\n\nThe weight of the aluminum in the coin is 10 grams. The volume of the pure aluminum coin is \u03c0r^2h = \u03c0(15)^2(1) = 225\u03c0 mm^3. Since the density of aluminum is d, the weight of the pure aluminum coin is:\n\n225\u03c0d = 10\n\nd = 10/(225\u03c0) \u2248 0.014\n\nThe weight of the pure aluminum coin is then:\n\n225\u03c0d = 225\u03c0(0.014) \u2248 9.9\n\nAnswer: None of the above (the closest option is A, but it is not the correct answer)",
