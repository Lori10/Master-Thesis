Let the distance between A and B be D and the distance between the point of intersection and A be x. The speed of train M is D/4 (since it covers D distance in 4 hours). The time taken by train M to travel from A to the point of intersection is x/(D/4) = 4x/D.\n\nNow, let's find the time taken by train N to travel from B to the point of intersection. The speed of train N is D/(3.5) (since it covers D distance in 3.5 hours). The time taken by train N to travel from B to the point of intersection is (D-x)/(D/(3.5)) = 3.5(D-x)/D.\n\nSince the two trains meet at the point of intersection, the time taken by both the trains to reach the point of intersection should be the same.

She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books?

            "Pred_Rationale": "If we use a single letter to represent each type of book, we would need at least 10 letters. If we use pairs of two different letters, we can form 10 pairs in 10C2 = 45 ways. Since the order of letters in a pair does not matter, we can divide by 2 to get 45/2 = 22.5 pairs, which rounds up to 23 pairs. Therefore, we need 46 letters to create the codes for all 10 types of books. The smallest number of letters we can use is 4, which can represent 4^2 = 16 different combinations.

In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 28 (C) 30 (D) 53 (E) 59",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's first find out how many times the number of water lilies will double from 1 to cover the lake and from 64 to cover the lake. \n\nFor the first case, we know that the number of water lilies doubles every two days. Let's say it doubles n times to cover the lake. Then we have:\n\n2^n = number of water lilies to cover the lake\n2^0 = 1 (initial number of water lilies)\n2^n = 2^(n-1) * 2 (number of water lilies after 2 days)\n2^n = 2^(n-2) * 2 * 2 (number of water lilies after 4 days)\n...\n2^n = 2^0 * 2 * 2 * ... * 2 (number of water lilies after 2n days)\n\nSo we have:\n\n2^n = 2^(n-1) * 2 = 2^(n-2) * 2 * 2 = ... = 2^0 * 2 * 2 * ... * 2\n2^n = 2^(n-1 + n-2 + ... + 0)\n2^n = 2^(n*(n+1)/2)\n\nWe know that 2^n is the number of water lilies to cover the lake, which is 2^k, where k is the number of days it takes to cover the lake. So we have:\n\n2^k = 2^(n*(n+1)/2)\nk = n*(n+1)/2\n\nWe know that it takes 60 days to cover the lake with water lilies, so we have:\n\n60 = n*(n+1)/2\nn^2 + n - 120 = 0\n(n+12)(n-10) = 0\n\nSince n has to be positive, we have n = 10.\n\nSo it takes 10 times for the number of water lilies to double to cover the lake.\n\nFor the second case, we know that there are 64 water lilies initially and the number of water lilies doubles every two days. Let's say it doubles m times to cover the lake. Then we have:\n\n2^m = number of water lilies to cover the lake\n2^6 = 64 (initial number of water lilies)\n2^m = 2^(m-1) * 2 (number of water lilies after 2 days)\n2^m = 2^(m-2) * 2 * 2 (number of water lilies after 4 days)\n...\n2^m = 2^6 * 2 * 2 * ... * 2 (number of water lilies after 2m days)\n\nSo we have:\n\n2^m = 2^(m-1) * 2 = 2^(m-2) * 2 * 2 = ... = 2^6 * 2 * 2 * ... * 2\n2^m = 2^(m-6)\nm = 6\n\nSo it takes 6 times for the number of water lilies to double from 64 to cover the lake.\n\nNow we need to find out how many days it takes for the number of water lilies to double from 64 to cover the lake. We know that it takes 2 days for the number of water lilies to double, so we have:\n\nnumber of days = 2 * 6 = 12\n\nSo it takes 12 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies if initially there were 64 water lilies on it.

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's first find the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. Let that number be x. \n\nThen, the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times x, which is 2.5x. \n\nWe know that all 250 files are either infected by a virus or a worm or both. So, we can write: \n\nNumber of files infected by a virus only + Number of files infected by a worm only + Number of files infected by both = 250 \n\nWe also know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. So, the number of files infected by a virus is 0.5 times the total number of files, which is 0.5(250) = 125. \n\nUsing this information, we can write: \n\nNumber of files infected by a virus only + Number of files infected by both = 125 \n\nWe can now use these two equations to solve for x: \n\nNumber of files infected by a virus only + Number of files infected by a worm only + x = 250 \n\nNumber of files infected by a virus only + x = 125 \n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get: \n\nNumber of files infected by a worm only = 125 - x \n\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get: \n\nNumber of files infected by a virus only + 125 - x + x = 250 \n\nNumber of files infected by a virus only = 125 \n\nSo, we now know that 125 files are infected by a virus only, and x files are infected by both a virus and a worm. \n\nTo find the number of files not infected by a worm, we need to subtract the number of files infected by a worm from the total number of files: \n\nNumber of files not infected by a worm = 250 - (125 + x + 2.5x) \n\nNumber of files not infected by a worm = 250 - (125 + 3.5x) \n\nWe know that all the files are either infected by a virus or a worm or both, so the number of files not infected by a worm is the same as the number of files infected by a virus only: \n\nNumber of files not infected by a worm = Number of files infected by a virus only = 125 \n\nTherefore, the answer is D) 100.",
