            "Question": "Q: At Daifu university, 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. If 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, what percentage of all Daifu students are members of the swim team? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 30% (C) 40% (D) 50% (E) 60%",
            "Pred_Rationale": " Let's say there are 100 students in Daifu university. Then, 24% of them are members of both a chess club and a swim team. That means, 24 students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. Let's say there are x students in the swim team. Then, 20% of them are not members of the chess club. That means, 0.2x students are not members of the chess club. Therefore, the number of students who are members of both a chess club and a swim team is x - 0.2x = 0.8x. We know that 0.8x = 24. Therefore, x = 30. So, there are 30 students in the swim team. Since there are 100 students in Daifu university, the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team is 30%. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }30\\%}$.<|im_end|>",

            "Pred_Rationale": " First, we have 6 books. We can choose any of them to be the first book. So, we have 6 choices. After we choose the first book, we have 5 books left. We can choose any of them to be the second book. So, we have 5 choices. After we choose the second book, we have 4 books left. We can choose any of them to be the third book. So, we have 4 choices. After we choose the third book, we have 3 books left. We can choose any of them to be the fourth book. So, we have 3 choices. After we choose the fourth book, we have 2 books left. We can choose any of them to be the fifth book. So, we have 2 choices. After we choose the fifth book, we have 1 book left. We can choose it to be the sixth book. So, we have 1 choice.

However, we are given the radius, not the diameter. Therefore, we need to use the formula C=2\u03c0r, where r is the radius. In this case, the radius is 5cm. Therefore, the circumference is 2\u03c0*5=10\u03c0cm. Therefore, the answer is (A) 10\u03c0cm. \n\nQ: You are an expert at arithmetic reasoning and are willing to solve algebraic word problems.

In this case, the radius is 3cm and the height is 6cm. Therefore, the base area is \u03c0r^2=\u03c0*3^2=9\u03c0. Therefore, the volume is 9\u03c0*6=54\u03c0cm^3.

            "Pred_Rationale": " First, we know that all 20 marbles were white. Then, we know that 1 out of 20 marbles were black. Therefore, 5% of the marbles are black.

Answer Choices: (A) 90720 (B) 72576 (C) 60480 (D) 50400 (E) 40320\nA: We can use complementary counting to solve this problem. First, we can find the total number of ways to arrange the letters in the word \"MATHCOUNTS\". There are 10 letters, so there are $10!$ ways to arrange them. However, we must divide by $2!$ for the two T's, $2!$ for the two O's, and $2!$ for the two U's. Therefore, there are $\\frac{10!}{2!2!2!}$ ways to arrange the letters in the word \"MATHCOUNTS\". Now, we must find the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word \"MATHCOUNTS\" such that at least two vowels are next to each other. We can use complementary counting to find this. We can find the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word \"MATHCOUNTS\" such that at least two vowels are next to each other. We can use casework to find this. If there are two vowels next to each other, there are $9$ ways to choose the two vowels and $8!$ ways to arrange the other letters. Therefore, there are $9 \\cdot 8!$ ways to arrange the letters in the word \"MATHCOUNTS\" such that two vowels are next to each other. If there are three vowels next to each other, there are $8$ ways to choose the three vowels and $7!$ ways to arrange the other letters. Therefore, there are $8 \\cdot 7!$ ways to arrange the letters in the word \"MATHCOUNTS\" such that three vowels are next to each other. If there are four vowels next to each other, there are $7$ ways to choose the four vowels and $6!$ ways to arrange the other letters. Therefore, there are $7 \\cdot 6!$ ways to arrange the letters in the word \"MATHCOUNTS\" such that four vowels are next to each other. Therefore, there are $9 \\cdot 8! + 8 \\cdot 7! + 7 \\cdot 6!$ ways to arrange the letters in the word \"MATHCOUNTS\" such that at least two vowels are next to each other. Therefore, there are $\\frac{10!}{2!2!2!} - (9 \\cdot 8! + 8 \\cdot 7! + 7 \\cdot ",

            "Pred_Rationale": " The population of the city increases by 5% annually. This means that the population of the city will be 105% of the current population after one year. After two years, the population of the city will be 105% of the population after one year. Therefore, the population of the city in two years time will be 105% of 105% of the current population. We can write this as follows: 78000 x 1.05 x 1.05 = 85995. Therefore, the answer is (B) 85995.\n\nQ: You are an expert at arithmetic reasoning and are willing to solve algebraic word problems.

If 2 cups of flour are needed to make 12 cookies, then we can write the proportion as follows: 2 cups / 12 cookies = x cups / 36 cookies. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and simplify: 2 x 36 = 12 x. Therefore, x = 6 cups.

            "Pred_Rationale": " Let the number be $abc$. We know that $a+b+c=17$ and $a^2+b^2+c^2=109$. We also know that $100a+10b+c-495=100c+10b+a$. Simplifying, we get $99a-99c=495$, or $a-c=5$. We can now substitute $c=a-5$ into the first two equations to get $2a+b=17$ and $2a^2+2b^2+10a-10b=109$. We can simplify the first equation to get $b=17-2a$, and substitute that into the second equation to get $2a^2+2(17-2a)^2+10a-10(17-2a)=109$. Simplifying, we get $-6a^2+68a-135=0$, which factors to $(-2a+9)(3a-15)=0$. Since $a$ must be less than $9$ and greater than $0$, we get $a=3$. Substituting that back into $a-c=5$, we get $c=-2$.

Simplifying, we get $2y^4+4y^2-32y+18=0$. We can factor this as $(y-2)(y^3+2y^2+8y-9)=0$. By the Rational Root Theorem, we can see that $y=2$ is a root of the cubic, so we can factor it as $(y-2)(y^2+4y-9)=0$.
