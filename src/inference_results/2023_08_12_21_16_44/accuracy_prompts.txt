To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\nQ: Frank invites his friends over to play video games. He bakes a pan of brownies before he arrives. He cuts 6 even columns and 3 even rows into the pan of brownies. If there are 6 people, including Frank, in total, how many brownies can they each eat?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThere are 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 brownies in total.\nEach person can eat 18 / 6 = <<18/6=3>>3 brownies. The answer is 3.\n\nQ: McKenna has 34 stuffed animals. Kenley has twice as many as McKenna.  Tenly has 5 more than Kenley . How many stuffed animals do the three girls have in all?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nKenley has 2 * 34 stuffed animals = <<2*34=68>>68 stuffed animals.\nTenly has 68 stuffed animals + 5 = <<68+5=73>>73 stuffed animals.\nThe three girls total had 34 + 68 + 73 = <<34+68+73=175>>175 stuffed animals The answer is 175.\n\nQ: The bus driver drives an average of 2 hours each day, 5 days a week. From Monday to Wednesday he drove at an average speed of 12 kilometers per hour, and from Thursday to Friday at an average speed of 9 kilometers per hour. How many kilometers did the driver travel during these 5 days?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nFrom Monday to Wednesday, there are 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 hours of work.\nDuring this time the driver drove 6 * 12 = <<6*12=72>>72 kilometers.\nOn Thursday and Friday, there are 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours of work in total.\nDuring this time the driver drove 4 * 9 = <<4*9=36>>36 kilometers.\nSo in total, the driver traveled 72 + 36 = <<72+36=108>>108 kilometers during these five days. The answer is 108.\n\nQ: Of the 100 soccer balls that Nova went to inflate, 40 percent had holes in them and could not inflate, while 20% of the remaining balls were overinflated and exploded. How many balls were inflated successfully and could be used?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nIf 40% of the balls had holes in them and could not inflate, their number was 40/100*100= <<40/100*100=40>>40\nThe remaining balls that Nova could inflate were 100-40 = <<100-40=60>>60\nWhile inflating, 20% of the good soccer balls were overinflated and exploded up, a total of 20/100*60 = <<20/100*60=12>>12\nThe number of soccer balls that inflated successfully and could be used is 60-12 = <<60-12=48>>48 The answer is 48.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",

To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\nQ: Stefan goes to a restaurant to eat dinner with his family. They order an appetizer that costs $10 and 4 entrees that are $20 each. If they tip 20% of the total for the waiter, what is the total amount of money that they spend at the restaurant?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe total cost of the entrees is 4 * $20 = $<<4*20=80>>80.\nThe total cost of the dinner is $80 + $10 = $<<80+10=90>>90.\nThe tip is $90 * 0.20 = $<<90*0.20=18>>18\nThe total cost with tip is $90 + $18 = $<<90+18=108>>108 The answer is 108.\n\nQ: In a jar that has 50 ants, the number of ants in the jar doubles each hour. How many ants will be in the jar after 5 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nAfter first hour, 50 * 2 = <<50*2=100>>100 ants.\nAfter the second hour, 100 * 2 = <<100*2=200>>200 ants.\nAfter the third hour, 200 * 2 = <<200*2=400>>400 ants.\nAfter the fourth hour, 400 * 2 = <<400*2=800>>800 ants.\nAfter the fifth hour, 800 * 2 = <<800*2=1600>>1600 ants. The answer is 1600.\n\nQ: Jane, Kyla, and Anthony have summer jobs in a resort. Their task is to fold guests' towels. Jane can fold 3 towels in 5 minutes. Kyla can fold 5 towels in 10 minutes, and Anthony can fold 7 towels in 20 minutes. If they all fold towels together, how many towels can they fold in one hour?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThere are 1 x 60 minutes = <<1*60=60>>60 minutes in 1 hour.\nThere are 60/5 = <<60/5=12>>12 sets of 5 minutes in 1 hour.\nSo, Jane can fold 3 x 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 towels in an hour.\nThere are 60/10 = <<60/10=6>>6 sets of 10 minutes in 1 hour.\nSo, Kyla can fold 5 x 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 towels in an hour.\nThere are 60/20 = <<60/20=3>>3 sets of 20 minutes in 1 hour.\nSo, Anthony can fold 7 x 3 = <<7*3=21>>21 towels in an hour.\nTherefore, the 3 of them can fold a total of 36 + 30 + 21 = <<36+30+21=87>>87 towels in 1 hour. The answer is 87.\n\nQ: 10 boxes each contain 50 bottles of water.  Each bottle has a capacity of 12 liters and is filled up to 3/4 of its capacity.  How many liters of water altogether are contained within the bottles in the boxes?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nSince each water bottle has a capacity of 12 liters, when filled up to 3/4 of capacity, each carries 3/4*12 = <<3/4*12=9>>9 liters of water.\nIf there are 50 bottles of water in each box, the number of liters the water bottles in a box are carrying is 50*9 = <<50*9=450>>450 liters.\nIn 10 boxes containing bottled water, the total number of liters in the water bottles is 450*10 =<<450*10=4500>>4500 liters. The answer is 4500.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
