{'prompt': "You are an expert at arithmetic reasoning and are willing to solve grade school math problems. To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\nQ: Frank invites his friends over to play video games. He bakes a pan of brownies before he arrives. He cuts 6 even columns and 3 even rows into the pan of brownies. If there are 6 people, including Frank, in total, how many brownies can they each eat?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThere are 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 brownies in total.\nEach person can eat 18 / 6 = <<18/6=3>>3 brownies. The answer is 3.\n\nQ: McKenna has 34 stuffed animals. Kenley has twice as many as McKenna.  Tenly has 5 more than Kenley . How many stuffed animals do the three girls have in all?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nKenley has 2 * 34 stuffed animals = <<2*34=68>>68 stuffed animals.\nTenly has 68 stuffed animals + 5 = <<68+5=73>>73 stuffed animals.\nThe three girls total had 34 + 68 + 73 = <<34+68+73=175>>175 stuffed animals The answer is 175.\n\nQ: The bus driver drives an average of 2 hours each day, 5 days a week. From Monday to Wednesday he drove at an average speed of 12 kilometers per hour, and from Thursday to Friday at an average speed of 9 kilometers per hour. How many kilometers did the driver travel during these 5 days?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nFrom Monday to Wednesday, there are 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 hours of work.\nDuring this time the driver drove 6 * 12 = <<6*12=72>>72 kilometers.\nOn Thursday and Friday, there are 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours of work in total.\nDuring this time the driver drove 4 * 9 = <<4*9=36>>36 kilometers.\nSo in total, the driver traveled 72 + 36 = <<72+36=108>>108 kilometers during these five days. The answer is 108.\n\nQ: Of the 100 soccer balls that Nova went to inflate, 40 percent had holes in them and could not inflate, while 20% of the remaining balls were overinflated and exploded. How many balls were inflated successfully and could be used?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nIf 40% of the balls had holes in them and could not inflate, their number was 40/100*100= <<40/100*100=40>>40\nThe remaining balls that Nova could inflate were 100-40 = <<100-40=60>>60\nWhile inflating, 20% of the good soccer balls were overinflated and exploded up, a total of 20/100*60 = <<20/100*60=12>>12\nThe number of soccer balls that inflated successfully and could be used is 60-12 = <<60-12=48>>48 The answer is 48.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step."}
