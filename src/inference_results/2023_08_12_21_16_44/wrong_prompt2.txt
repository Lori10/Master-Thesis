{'prompt': "You are an expert at arithmetic reasoning and are willing to solve grade school math problems. To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\nQ: Stefan goes to a restaurant to eat dinner with his family. They order an appetizer that costs $10 and 4 entrees that are $20 each. If they tip 20% of the total for the waiter, what is the total amount of money that they spend at the restaurant?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThe total cost of the entrees is 4 * $20 = $<<4*20=80>>80.\nThe total cost of the dinner is $80 + $10 = $<<80+10=90>>90.\nThe tip is $90 * 0.20 = $<<90*0.20=18>>18\nThe total cost with tip is $90 + $18 = $<<90+18=108>>108 The answer is 108.\n\nQ: In a jar that has 50 ants, the number of ants in the jar doubles each hour. How many ants will be in the jar after 5 hours?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nAfter first hour, 50 * 2 = <<50*2=100>>100 ants.\nAfter the second hour, 100 * 2 = <<100*2=200>>200 ants.\nAfter the third hour, 200 * 2 = <<200*2=400>>400 ants.\nAfter the fourth hour, 400 * 2 = <<400*2=800>>800 ants.\nAfter the fifth hour, 800 * 2 = <<800*2=1600>>1600 ants. The answer is 1600.\n\nQ: Jane, Kyla, and Anthony have summer jobs in a resort. Their task is to fold guests' towels. Jane can fold 3 towels in 5 minutes. Kyla can fold 5 towels in 10 minutes, and Anthony can fold 7 towels in 20 minutes. If they all fold towels together, how many towels can they fold in one hour?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nThere are 1 x 60 minutes = <<1*60=60>>60 minutes in 1 hour.\nThere are 60/5 = <<60/5=12>>12 sets of 5 minutes in 1 hour.\nSo, Jane can fold 3 x 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 towels in an hour.\nThere are 60/10 = <<60/10=6>>6 sets of 10 minutes in 1 hour.\nSo, Kyla can fold 5 x 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 towels in an hour.\nThere are 60/20 = <<60/20=3>>3 sets of 20 minutes in 1 hour.\nSo, Anthony can fold 7 x 3 = <<7*3=21>>21 towels in an hour.\nTherefore, the 3 of them can fold a total of 36 + 30 + 21 = <<36+30+21=87>>87 towels in 1 hour. The answer is 87.\n\nQ: 10 boxes each contain 50 bottles of water.  Each bottle has a capacity of 12 liters and is filled up to 3/4 of its capacity.  How many liters of water altogether are contained within the bottles in the boxes?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nSince each water bottle has a capacity of 12 liters, when filled up to 3/4 of capacity, each carries 3/4*12 = <<3/4*12=9>>9 liters of water.\nIf there are 50 bottles of water in each box, the number of liters the water bottles in a box are carrying is 50*9 = <<50*9=450>>450 liters.\nIn 10 boxes containing bottled water, the total number of liters in the water bottles is 450*10 =<<450*10=4500>>4500 liters. The answer is 4500.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step."}
