On Wednesday she went to another store and bought 5 times the number of cakes she did on Tuesday. How many cakes did she buy after all three days?",
            "Pred_Rationale": "\nRose bought 4 cakes on Monday, so on Tuesday she bought 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 cakes.\nOn Wednesday she bought 5 * 12 = <<5*12=60>>60 cakes.\nThe total number of cakes she bought after all three days is 4 + 12 + 60 = <<4+12+60=76>>76 cakes. The answer is 76.",
