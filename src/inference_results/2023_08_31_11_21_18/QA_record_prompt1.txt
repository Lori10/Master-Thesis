Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The problem tells us that one gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. Let's call the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E \"E\" and the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A \"A\". \n\nSo, one gram of the health food contains 0.09E of vitamin E and 0.08A of vitamin A. \n\nTo find out how many grams of the health food we need to eat daily to get at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to set up two equations: \n\n0.09E * x >= E \n\n0.08A * x >= A \n\nwhere x is the number of grams of the health food we need to eat daily. \n\nSimplifying these equations, we get: \n\nx >= E / 0.09 \n\nx >= A / 0.08 \n\nWe want to find the minimum value of x that satisfies both of these inequalities. \n\nLet's say E = 100 and A = 120 (just as an example). \n\nThen, \n\nx >= 100 / 0.09 \n\nx >= 120 / 0.08 \n\nx >= 1111.11 \n\nx >= 1500 \n\nSo, we need to eat at least 1500 grams (or 1.5 kilograms) of the health food daily to get at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins. \n\nLooking at the answer choices, the closest one is (E) 16.5, which is 16500 grams (or 16.5 kilograms).

Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Step 1: The company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. So, the total revenue from selling pens is 7200 x 10 = Rs. 72,000.\n\nStep 2: The company estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. So, the total profit is 25% of Rs. 72,000 = Rs. 18,000.\n\nStep 3: Let's assume that the cost of manufacturing each pen is Rs. x. Then, the total cost of manufacturing 7200 pens is 7200x.\n\nStep 4: We know that 10% of the produced pens are always defective and are rejected before packing. So, the company can only sell 90% of the produced pens. Therefore, the total cost of manufacturing 7200 pens is equal to 90% of the cost of manufacturing all the produced pens. Mathematically, we can write:\n\n7200x = 0.9(Cost of manufacturing all the produced pens)\n\nStep 5: Let's solve for the cost of manufacturing each pen:\n\n7200x = 0.9(x x Total number of produced pens)\n\n7200x = 0.9(x x 8000) [since 10% of the produced pens are defective, the total number of produced pens is 8000]\n\n7200x = 7200x\n\nx = Rs. 7.2\n\nTherefore, the manufactured cost of each pen is Rs. 7.2.

Then, the area of the square is s^2.\n\nNext, we know that one edge of the square is trimmed by 4 feet to form a rectangle. Let's call the length of the rectangle \"l\" and the width \"w\". We know that w = s - 4, since 4 feet is trimmed from one edge. We don't know the value of \"l\" yet.\n\nWe also know that the rectangle is cut diagonally in half to form two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. The area of a triangle is given by the formula (1/2)bh, where \"b\" is the base and \"h\" is the height. Since the two triangles are congruent, they have the same base and height.\n\nLet's call the base and height of each triangle \"b\" and \"h\", respectively. Then, we have:\n\n(1/2)bh = 70\n\nbh = 140\n\nWe also know that the length of the rectangle is equal to the hypotenuse of each triangle. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can write:\n\nl^2 = b^2 + h^2\n\nl^2 = (2bh)^2 + (bh)^2   (since we know that b*h = 140)\n\nl^2 = 5b^2h^2\n\nl = bh*sqrt(5)\n\nNow, we can use the fact that w = s - 4 and l = bh*sqrt(5) to write an equation for the area of the rectangle:\n\nlw = s^2 - 4s\n\n(bh*sqrt(5))(s-4) = s^2 - 4s\n\nbh*sqrt(5) = s + 4sqrt(5)\n\nNow, we can use the fact that b*h = 140 to write an equation for s:\n\nbh*sqrt(5) = s + 4sqrt(5)\n\n140*sqrt(5) = s + 4sqrt(5)\n\ns = 136\n\nTherefore, the original square piece of cloth had a side length of 136 feet.

We can do this by adding the number of children to the left of Neha and the number of children to the right of Radha, and then subtracting the overlap (Neha and Radha themselves).\n\nSo, the number of children to the left of Neha is 11 (since Neha is 12th from the left end), and the number of children to the right of Radha is 5 (since Radha is 6th from the right end). Subtracting the overlap (which is just Radha herself, since she is also one of the children to the left of Neha) gives us:\n\n11 + 5 - 1 = 15\n\nSo there are 15 children in the row.\n\nNext, we need to find the new positions of Neha and Radha after they are shifted. Neha is shifted 2 places to the right, so her new position is 12 + 2 = 14. Radha is shifted 2 places to the left, so her new position is 6 - 2 = 4.\n\nFinally, we need to find the number of children between Neha and Radha after they are shifted.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.\n\nLet's assume that there are a total of 100 students in the class. Let the number of passing students be 'p' and the number of failing students be 'f'. Therefore, we have:\n\np + f = 100   (since the total number of students is 100)\n\nLet the average score of passing students be 'a' and the average score of failing students be 'b'. Therefore, we have:\n\n(a * p + b * f) / (p + f) = 76   (since the overall class average is 76)\n\nAlso, we know that:\n\na = 83   (since the passing students had an average of 83)\nb = 55   (since the failing students had an average of 55)\n\nSubstituting the values of 'a' and 'b' in the second equation, we get:\n\n(83p + 55f) / 100 = 76\n\nMultiplying both sides by 100, we get:\n\n83p + 55f = 7600\n\nNow, we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for 'p' and 'f' by solving these equations simultaneously. One way to do this is to multiply the first equation by 55 and subtract it from the second equation. This gives us:\n\n83p + 55f = 7600\n-55p - 55f = -5500\n-------------------\n28p      = 2100\n\nDividing both sides by 28, we get:\n\np = 75\n\nTherefore, the number of passing students is 75.

So if the merchant pays within 30 days, they will only have to pay $19,200.\n\nLet's say the merchant borrows the full amount for n days at a simple interest rate of r%. The interest they would have to pay is:\n\n$20,000 x r x (n/365)\n\nIf the merchant pays within 30 days, they will save $800.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find out how much of the pool hose A can fill in one hour. Since it takes 8 hours for hose A to fill the entire pool, it can fill 1/8 of the pool in one hour.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much of the pool hose A can fill in the first 2 hours. Since it can fill 1/8 of the pool in one hour, it can fill 2/8 or 1/4 of the pool in 2 hours.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much of the pool the two hoses can fill in one hour. Let's call the rate of hose B \"b\". Since hose A can fill 1/8 of the pool in one hour, the two hoses together can fill 1/8 + b of the pool in one hour.\n\nWe know that the two hoses, working together, finished filling the pool in 3 hours. This means that they filled 3/5 of the pool (since they filled 1/4 of the pool in the first 2 hours). So we can set up the equation:\n\n3/5 = 2/4 + 3(1/8 + b)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n3/5 = 1/2 + 3/8 + 3b\n3/5 = 7/8 + 3b\n3b = 3/5 - 7/8\n3b = 1/40\nb = 1/120\n\nSo hose B can fill 1/120 of the pool in one hour. To find out how long it would take hose B to fill the entire pool, we can set up the equation:\n\n1 = 2/8 + t(1/8 + 1/120)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n1 = 1/4 + (15/120)t\n1 = 1/4 + (1/8)t\n3/4 = (1/8)t\nt = 6\n\nTherefore, it would take hose B 6 hours to fill the entire pool.

We know that S is a percentage of all Daifu students, so it must be less than or equal to 100%. We also know that x% is a percentage of all Daifu students who are in the swim team but not in the chess club, so it must be less than or equal to the percentage of all Daifu students who are in the swim team. In other words:\n\nx% \u2264 S\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nx% + 19.2% = S\nx% \u2264 S\n\nWe can see that the smallest S can be is 19.2%, because that's the percentage of students who are in both the chess club and the swim team. The largest S can be is 100%, because that's the maximum percentage of students who can be in the swim team. So, the answer is (B) 30%, because it's the only option between 19.2% and 100%.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can start by finding the time it takes for each person to bike 1 mile individually. \n\nFor Janice: \n- Time = Distance / Speed \n- Time = 1 mile / 10 mph \n- Time = 0.1 hour or 6 minutes \n\nFor Jennie: \n- Time = Distance / Speed \n- Time = 1 mile / 20 mph \n- Time = 0.05 hour or 3 minutes \n\nNow, to find the time it takes for them to collectively bike 1 mile, we can use the formula: \n\n- Time = Total Distance / Total Speed \n\nSince they are biking the same distance, the total distance is 1 mile.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we know that M > N, which means that abc > cba. This implies that a > c or a = c and b > a.\n\nNext, we can write M - N as (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99(a - c). Therefore, we have:\n\n99(a - c) + 396c = 990\n\nDividing both sides by 99, we get:\n\na - c + 4c = 10\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\na - 3c = 10\n\nNow, we want to find how many values of M are more than 300. Since M is a three-digit number, we know that a > 0. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation above as:\n\na = 3c + 10\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for M, we get:\n\nM = (3c + 10)bc\n\nSince M is a three-digit number, we know that b and c cannot be 0. Therefore, we can write:\n\nM = 100(3c + 1) + 10b + c\n\nM > 300 implies that 3c + 1 > 3, or c > 0. Therefore, we can write:\n\nM = 100(3c + 1) + 10b + c > 300\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n31c + 10b > 199\n\nSince b and c are integers between 1 and 9, we can list all possible values of (b, c) that satisfy this inequality:\n\n(1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (8, 9), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9)\n\nThere are 54 pairs of (b, c) that satisfy the inequality, and each pair corresponds to a unique value of M.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We know that when 2272 is divided by N, it leaves a remainder R. This means that 2272 can be written as:\n\n2272 = N * Q + R\n\nwhere Q is the quotient of the division. Similarly, we can write:\n\n875 = N * P + R\n\nwhere P is the quotient of the division.\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get:\n\n1397 = N * (Q - P)\n\nNow, we know that N is a 3-digit number, so it can be written as:\n\nN = 100a + 10b + c\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the digits of N. We want to find the sum of these digits, which is a + b + c.\n\nLet's divide 1397 by N:\n\nQ - P = 1397/N\n\nSubstituting N with its digits, we get:\n\nQ - P = 1397/(100a + 10b + c)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 100a + 10b + c, we get:\n\n(100a + 10b + c)(Q - P) = 1397\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\n100aQ + 10bQ + cQ - 100aP - 10bP - cP = 1397\n\nWe know that both 2272 and 875 leave the same remainder R when divided by N. This means that:\n\nR = 2272 - NQ = 875 - NP\n\nSubstituting NQ with 2272 - R and NP with 875 - R, we get:\n\nN = (2272 - R)/Q = (875 - R)/P\n\nMultiplying both sides by QP, we get:\n\nNQP = 2272P - RP = 875Q - RQ\n\nAdding RP and RQ to both sides, we get:\n\nNQP + RP + RQ = 2272P + 875Q\n\nSubstituting NQP with 1397, we get:\n\n1397 + RP + RQ = 2272P + 875Q\n\nSubstituting 2272P - RP with NQ and 875Q - RQ with NP, we get:\n\n1397 + NP + NQ = NQP\n\nSubstituting NQP with 2272P - RP, we get:\n\n1397 + NP + NQ = 2272P - RP\n\nSubstituting NQP with 875Q - RQ, we get:\n\n1397 + NP + NQ = 875Q - RQ\n\nNow we have two equations with three variables (N, P, and Q). We need one more equation to solve for these variables. Let's use the fact that N is a 3-digit number, which means that a is not equal to 0.\n\nFrom the equation N = 100a + 10b + c, we get:\n\na = (N - 10b - c)/100\n\nSince a is an integer, N - 10b - c must be divisible by 100. We also know that N leaves a remainder R when divided by N, which means that N - R is divisible by N. Therefore, N - 10b - c - R is divisible by N.\n\nSubstituting N with 2272 - R, we get:\n\n2272 - R - 10b - c - R = Nk\n\nwhere k is an integer. Simplifying, we get:\n\n2N - 2R - 10b - c = Nk\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nN - R - 5b - c = (N/2)k\n\nSince N is a 3-digit number, we know that N/2 is not an integer. Therefore, k must be an odd integer. Let's try k = 1, 3, 5, and 7.\n\nFor k = 1, we get:\n\nN - R - 5b - c = N/2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n2N - 2R - 10b - 2c = N\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\n10b + 2c = N - 2R\n\nSince N and R are both digits, we know that N - 2R is an even integer between 0 and 18. Let's try all possible values:\n\nN - 2R = 0 --> N = 2R, which is impossible since N is a 3-digit number.\nN - 2R = 2 --> 10b + 2c = 2 --> 5b + c = 1. The only solution is b = 0 and c = 1, which gives N = 101.\nN - 2R = 4 --> 10b + 2c = 4 --> 5b + c = 2.",

A quadrilateral is a polygon with four sides. \n\nTo form a quadrilateral using 4 of the points A, B, C, D, E, and F, we need to choose 4 points from the given 6 points. \n\nSince F is the center of the pentagon, any quadrilateral that includes F will be the same as another quadrilateral that includes F but with the points in a different order. \n\nTherefore, we can choose 4 points from A, B, C, D, and E in 5C4 ways (5 choose 4). \n\n5C4 = 5 \n\nSo, there are 5 ways to choose 4 points from A, B, C, D, and E. \n\nHowever, we need to subtract the quadrilaterals that include F. \n\nThere are 5 quadrilaterals that include F: AFBC, BFCD, CFDE, DEAF, and EABF. \n\nTherefore, the total number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed by joining 4 of the points A, B, C, D, E, and F is: \n\n5 - 5 = 0 \n\nSo, the answer is None of the above.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we know that all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. Let's represent the number of files infected only by a virus as V, the number of files infected only by a worm as W, and the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm as B. \n\nWe know that V + W + B = 250. \n\nWe also know that W = 2.5B, since the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. \n\nWe want to find the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm. Let's call this number X. \n\nWe know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so the number of files infected by a virus is 0.5(250) = 125. \n\nTherefore, the number of files infected by a worm is 250 - 125 = 125. \n\nWe can also write an equation for X: \n\nX + B = 125 \n\nWe can substitute W = 2.5B into the equation V + W + B = 250 to get: \n\nV + 3.5B = 250 \n\nWe can solve for B by subtracting V from both sides: \n\n3.5B = 250 - V \n\nWe can substitute W = 2.5B into the equation W + B = 125 to get: \n\n2.5B + B = 125 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n3.5B = 125 - X \n\n2.5B = 125 - X \n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get: \n\nB = 0.5 \n\nSubstituting B = 0.5 into the equation 3.5B = 250 - V, we get: \n\nV = 237.5 \n\nSubstituting V = 237.5 and B = 0.5 into the equation X + B = 125, we get: \n\nX = 124.5 \n\nTherefore, the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm is 124.5, which is closest to answer choice (E) 125. \n\nNote: It's important to remember that in real life, you can't have half a file, so the answer would actually be rounded up to 125.",

If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the volume of the coin made of alloy. \n\nThe volume of a cylinder (which is the shape of the coin) is given by the formula V = \u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius (half the diameter) and h is the height (thickness). \n\nIn this case, r = 7.5 mm and h = 2 mm, so the volume of the coin is:\n\nV = \u03c0(7.5 mm)^2(2 mm) = 352.7 mm^3\n\nSince the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, we can divide the volume by 2 to get the volume of each metal:\n\nV_aluminum = V_silver = 176.4 mm^3\n\nNext, we need to find the weight of the aluminum in the coin made of alloy. We know that the weight of the entire coin is 30 grams, but we don't know the proportion of aluminum and silver in the alloy. Let's call the proportion of aluminum x (out of a total of 1):\n\nWeight_aluminum = x(\u03c1_aluminum)V_aluminum\n\nwhere \u03c1_aluminum is the density of aluminum (which we don't know yet). Similarly, the weight of silver in the coin is:\n\nWeight_silver = (1-x)(\u03c1_silver)V_silver\n\nwhere \u03c1_silver is the density of silver (which is twice that of aluminum).\n\nWe also know that the total weight of the coin is 30 grams:\n\nWeight_aluminum + Weight_silver = 30 g\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the weights and volumes, we get:\n\nx(\u03c1_aluminum)V_aluminum + (1-x)(2\u03c1_aluminum)V_aluminum = 30 g\n\nSimplifying and solving for x, we get:\n\nx = 0.25\n\nSo the alloy contains 25% aluminum and 75% silver. Now we can find the density of aluminum:\n\nWeight_aluminum = 0.25(\u03c1_aluminum)(176.4 mm^3) = 0.25(\u03c1_aluminum)(0.1764 cm^3) = 0.0441\u03c1_aluminum g\n\nWeight_silver = 0.75(2\u03c1_aluminum)(176.4 mm^3) = 0.75(2\u03c1_aluminum)(0.1764 cm^3) = 0.2646\u03c1_aluminum g\n\nWeight_aluminum + Weight_silver = 30 g\n\n0.0441\u03c1_aluminum + 0.2646\u03c1_aluminum = 30 g\n\n0.3087\u03c1_aluminum = 30 g\n\n\u03c1_aluminum = 97.16 g/cm^3\n\nNow we can find the weight of a pure aluminum coin measuring 1 x 30 mm:\n\nV = \u03c0(15 mm)^2(1 mm) = 706.9 mm^3\n\nWeight = (\u03c1_aluminum)V = (97.16 g/cm^3)(0.7069 cm^3) = 68.7 g\n\nTherefore, the answer is None of the above, since none of the answer choices is close to 68.7 g.",
