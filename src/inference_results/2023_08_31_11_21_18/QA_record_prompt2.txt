Therefore,\n\n0.09x * z >= x (minimum daily requirement of vitamin E)\n0.08y * z >= y (minimum daily requirement of vitamin A)\n\nSimplifying the above equations, we get:\n\nz >= x / 0.09\nz >= y / 0.08\n\nTo obtain at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to eat the maximum of the above two values.\n\nSo, z = max(x / 0.09, y / 0.08)\n\nSubstituting the values given in the problem, we get:\n\nz = max(x / 0.09, y / 0.08) = max(x / 0.09, x / 0.1) = x / 0.09\n\nTherefore, we need to eat (x / 0.09) grams of the health food daily to obtain at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.\n\nSubstituting the value of x given in the problem, we get:\n\nWe need to eat (100 / 9) grams of the health food daily to obtain at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.\n\nSo, the answer is (E) 16.5.",

So, the number of good pens the company produces is 0.9x. We know that the company needs to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler, so we can set up an equation: \n\n0.9x = 7200 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx = 8000 \n\nSo, the company needs to manufacture 8000 pens to deliver 7200 good pens to the wholesaler. \n\nNext, we need to find out the manufacturing cost of each pen. We know that the company estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. This means that the selling price of each pen is 125% of the manufacturing cost. Let's call the manufacturing cost of each pen \"c\". \n\nThe selling price of each pen is Rs. 10, so we can set up an equation: \n\n1.25c = 10 \n\nSolving for c, we get: \n\nc = 8 \n\nTherefore, the manufacturing cost of each pen is Rs. 8. \n\nThe answer is (D) Rs. 8.",

Let's say the total number of people is x. Then: \n\nn = x - 10 \n\nSo the number of ways to choose 10 people from the remaining group is: \n\n(x - 10) choose 10 = (x - 10)! / (10! * (x - 20)!) \n\nWe don't know the value of x, but we can see that the answer choices are all integers.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step. \n\nLet's assume that there are n members in the family. \n\nWe know that the median income is $3000, which means that half of the family members earn less than $3000 and half earn more than $3000. \n\nLet's assume that k members earn less than $3000 and (n-k) members earn more than $3000. \n\nThe total income of the family is $9000, which means that the sum of the incomes of all the family members is $9000. \n\nWe can write an equation based on the information we have: \n\nk($3000) + (n-k)(>$3000) = $9000 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n3000k + (n-k)(>$3000) = 9000 \n\nExpanding the second term, we get: \n\n3000k + (n-k)(x) + (n-k)(y) + (n-k)(z) = 9000 \n\nwhere x, y, and z represent the number of family members earning more than $3000. \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n3000k + (n-k)(x+y+z) = 9000 \n\nSince we know that k = (n-k), we can substitute this into the equation: \n\n3000k + k(x+y+z) = 9000 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nk(3000+x+y+z) = 9000 \n\nWe know that k is a positive integer, so we need to find a combination of x, y, and z that makes (3000+x+y+z) a factor of 9000. \n\nThe factors of 9000 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 25, 30, 36, 40, 45, 50, 60, 72, 75, 90, 100, 120, 150, 180, 225, 300, 360, 450, 600, 900, and 1800. \n\nWe can see that the only combination of x, y, and z that makes (3000+x+y+z) a factor of 9000 is x=3, y=3, and z=3. \n\nTherefore, k(3000+3+3+3) = 9000, which means that k = 1. \n\nSo, there is only one family member earning less than $3000, which means that there are (n-k) = (n-1) family members earning more than $3000. \n\nTherefore, the total number of family members is n = k + (n-k) = 1 + (n-1) = n. \n\nSo, the answer is (A) 2.",

So the time it takes for them to meet for the first time is:\n\ntime = d / 132\n\nOnce they meet for the first time, Allen has traveled a distance of d/2 and Bob has traveled a distance of 3d/2 (since he traveled an extra 48 km).

Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's break down the problem. \n\nThe terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can get a 4% discount if they pay within 30 days, or they can pay the full amount within n days and get no discount. \n\nTo take advantage of the discount, the merchant needs to pay within 30 days. This means they need to pay $20,000 - 4% of $20,000 = $19,200. \n\nIf the merchant borrows money to pay for the boat, they will need to pay back the loan plus interest. Let's say they borrow P dollars at an interest rate of r% per year for n years. Then the amount they will need to pay back is:\n\nP + P*r*n\n\nWe want to find the highest interest rate r that the merchant can afford to pay and still make a profit from the discount. \n\nIf the merchant borrows money at an interest rate of r%, then they will need to pay back P*(1+r*n) dollars after n years. We want this amount to be less than or equal to $19,200. \n\nSo we have the inequality:\n\nP*(1+r*n) <= 19200\n\nWe know that P = $20,000, n = 30/365 (since the payment is due within 30 days), and we want to solve for r. \n\nSubstituting these values, we get:\n\n$20,000*(1+r*(30/365)) <= $19,200\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n1 + r*(30/365) <= 0.96\n\nSubtracting 1 from both sides, we get:\n\nr*(30/365) <= -0.04\n\nDividing both sides by (30/365), we get:\n\nr <= -0.04*(365/30)\n\nr <= -0.4867\n\nSince the interest rate cannot be negative, the highest interest rate the merchant can afford to pay is 0.

If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number. Answer Choices: (A) 368 (B) 377 (C) 288 (D) 997 (E) 112",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.\n\nLet the three-digit number be represented by ABC, where A, B, and C are the digits in the hundreds, tens, and ones places, respectively.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that:\n\nA + B + C = 17  (Equation 1)\nA^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109  (Equation 2)\n\nWe also know that when we subtract 495 from the number, we get a number with the same digits in reverse order. This means that:\n\nABC - 495 = CBA\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100C + 10B + A\n99A - 99C = 495\nA - C = 5  (Equation 3)\n\nNow we have three equations (Equations 1, 2, and 3) with three unknowns (A, B, and C). We can use these equations to solve for A, B, and C.\n\nFrom Equation 1, we know that A + B = 17 - C. We can substitute this into Equation 2 to get:\n\nA^2 + B^2 + (17 - A - B)^2 = 109\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2A^2 + 2B^2 - 34A - 34B + 194 = 0\nA^2 + B^2 - 17A - 17B + 97 = 0\n\nWe can use this equation along with Equation 3 to solve for A and C in terms of B:\n\nA = B + 5\nC = B - 5\n\nSubstituting these into the equation above, we get:\n\n(B + 5)^2 + B^2 - 17(B + 5) - 17B + 97 = 0\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2B^2 - 32B + 72 = 0\nB^2 - 16B + 36 = 0\n(B - 2)(B - 14) = 0\n\nTherefore, B = 2 or B = 14.\n\nIf B = 2, then A = 7 and C = -3, which is not possible since C is a digit between 0 and 9. Therefore, we must have B = 14.\n\nSubstituting B = 14 into A = B + 5 and C = B - 5, we get:\n\nA = 19\nC = 9\n\nTherefore, the three-digit number is 199.\n\nChecking our answer, we see that the sum of the digits is 1 + 9 + 9 = 19, which satisfies Equation 1. The sum of the squares of the digits is 1^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 163, which does not satisfy Equation 2. Therefore, our answer is incorrect.\n\nWe made a mistake in assuming that C = B - 5. Since C is a digit between 0 and 9, we must have C = B - 5 or C = B + 5. Let's try C = B + 5:\n\nA = B + 5\nC = B + 5\n\nSubstituting these into Equation 2, we get:\n\n(B + 5)^2 + B^2 + (B - 12)^2 = 109\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n3B^2 - 26B + 36 = 0\n(B - 4)(3B - 9) = 0\n\nTherefore, B = 4 or B = 3.\n\nIf B = 4, then A = 9 and C = 9. If B = 3, then A = 8 and C = 8. Since the sum of the digits is 17, we must have B = 4, A = 9, and C = 9.\n\nTherefore, the three-digit number is 499.\n\nChecking our answer, we see that the sum of the digits is 4 + 9 + 9 = 22, which does not satisfy Equation 1. Therefore, our answer is incorrect.\n\nWe made a mistake in assuming that the sum of the digits is 17. Let's try the other possibility:\n\nA = B + 5\nC = B - 5\n\nSubstituting these into Equation 1, we get:\n\n(B + 5) + B + (B - 5) = 17\n3B = 17\nB = 5.67\n\nSince B is not a whole number, this is not possible. Therefore, there is no solution to the problem.\n\nThe answer is None of the above.",

First, we need to find two factors of 256000 that add up to 1000. We can start by finding the prime factorization of 256000:\n\n256000 = 2^9 * 5^4\n\nWe can see that 1000 is a factor of 256000, so we can divide 256000 by 1000 to get:\n\n256000 / 1000 = 256\n\nNow we need to find two factors of 256 that add up to 2x.

We know that:\n\nx + y = 1000\n\nAnd we can rewrite this as:\n\ny = 1000 - x\n\nWe also know that:\n\nx - y = 256 / (x + y)\n\nWe can substitute y with 1000 - x to get:\n\nx - (1000 - x) = 256 / (2x)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2x^2 - 2000x + 256000 = 0\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nx^2 - 1000x + 128000 = 0\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = (1000 \u00b1 sqrt(1000^2 - 4 * 1 * 128000)) / (2 * 1)\n\nx = (1000 \u00b1 sqrt(1000000 - 512000)) / 2\n\nx = (1000 \u00b1 sqrt(488000)) / 2\n\nx = (1000 \u00b1 20sqrt(1220)) / 2\n\nx \u2248 628 or x \u2248 372\n\nSo the two numbers are approximately 628 and 372. Therefore, the answer is (B) 628, 372.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nLet's start by finding the growth rate of the water lilies. We know that the number of water lilies doubles every two days. This means that the growth rate is 100% every two days, or 50% per day.\n\nNext, let's find out how many days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies if there is only one water lily initially. We know that the growth rate is 50% per day, so after one day there will be two water lilies, after two days there will be four water lilies, after three days there will be eight water lilies, and so on. We can see that the number of water lilies doubles every two days, so after 60 days there will be 2^30 water lilies on the lake. This means that the lake will be fully covered with water lilies after 60 days.\n\nNow, let's find out how many days it will take for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies if there are initially 64 water lilies. We can use the same growth rate of 50% per day, but we need to adjust for the initial number of water lilies. After one day, there will be 64 * 1.5 = 96 water lilies. After two days, there will be 96 * 1.5 = 144 water lilies. After three days, there will be 144 * 1.5 = 216 water lilies. We can see that the number of water lilies is growing exponentially, so we can use the formula:\n\nN = N0 * (1 + r)^t\n\nwhere N is the final number of water lilies, N0 is the initial number of water lilies, r is the growth rate (in decimal form), and t is the number of days.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n2^30 = 64 * (1 + 0.5)^t\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n2^25 = 1.5^t\n\nTaking the logarithm of both sides, we get:\n\n25 log(2) = t log(1.5)\n\nSolving for t, we get:\n\nt = 25 log(2) / log(1.5) \u2248 53\n\nTherefore, it will take approximately 53 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies if there are initially 64 water lilies.

Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold? Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we know that all 20 marbles pulled out the first time were white, since the bag only contained white marbles at the beginning. Then, we know that 1 out of 20 marbles pulled out the second time was black, and this represents the percentage of black marbles in the bag. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n1/20 = number of black marbles / total number of marbles\n\nSolving for the number of black marbles, we get:\n\nnumber of black marbles = total number of marbles / 20\n\nWe also know that the total number of marbles in the bag increased from 20 to some new value Q. Therefore, we can set up another equation:\n\nQ = 20 + number of black marbles\n\nSubstituting the expression for number of black marbles from the first equation, we get:\n\nQ = 20 + (total number of marbles / 20)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 20, we get:\n\n20Q = 400 + total number of marbles\n\nBut we also know that the total number of marbles is Q, since the bag currently holds Q marbles. Therefore, we can substitute Q for the total number of marbles in the equation:\n\n20Q = 400 + Q\n\nSolving for Q, we get:\n\nQ = 400 / 19\n\nThis is approximately equal to 21.05, so the closest answer choice is A, 40.

Then, we can write the sum of these k integers as:\n\nx + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1)\n\nWe know that the least integer is -50, so we can set x = -50. Substituting this value, we get:\n\n-50 + (-49) + (-48) + ... + (x+k-1)\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nkx + (1+2+3+...+k-1)\n\nWe know that the sum of the first n natural numbers is given by the formula:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2\n\nUsing this formula, we can simplify the expression further:\n\nkx + (k-1)k/2\n\nWe are given that the sum of these k integers is 51. Substituting this value, we get:\n\nkx + (k-1)k/2 = 51\n\nSubstituting x = -50, we get:\n\n-50k + (k-1)k/2 = 51\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nk^2 - 99k - 102 = 0\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\nk = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nSubstituting the values of a, b, and c, we get:\n\nk = (99 \u00b1 sqrt(99^2 + 4*1*102)) / 2\n\nk = (99 \u00b1 sqrt(9801 + 408)) / 2\n\nk = (99 \u00b1 sqrt(10209)) / 2\n\nk = (99 \u00b1 101) / 2\n\nWe can ignore the negative value of k, since we are looking for the number of consecutive integers. Therefore, we get:\n\nk = (99 + 101) / 2\n\nk = 100\n\nTherefore, the answer is not given in the answer choices. The correct answer is None of the above.",

This means that 60% do not take both vacations. \n\nFinally, we know that 20% take neither vacation. This means that 80% take at least one vacation. \n\nTo find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, we need to subtract the percentage of employees who take both vacations from the percentage of employees who take only a summer vacation. \n\nThe percentage of employees who take only a summer vacation is 60% of the 80% who take at least one vacation, which is 48%. \n\nThe percentage of employees who take both vacations is 40% of the 75% who take a winter vacation, which is 30%. \n\nTherefore, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 48% - 30%, which is 18%. \n\nSo the answer is (B) 15%.

We can do this by multiplying the horizontal speed by the time: \n\nDistance = Horizontal speed x Time = ? x 5s \n\nWe don't know the horizontal speed yet, but we can use the fact that the shuttle's path forms a right triangle with the height it travels and the distance it travels horizontally. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for the hypotenuse (which is the length of the shuttle): \n\nLength of shuttle = sqrt((700m)^2 + Distance^2) \n\nNow we just need to solve for the distance. We know that the shuttle's average speed is the total distance it travels divided by the total time it takes: \n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time \n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the distance: \n\nDistance = Average speed x Total time \n\nWe know the total time is 40s + 5s = 45s. We also know the average speed is the hypotenuse of the right triangle divided by the time it takes to travel that distance: \n\nAverage speed = Length of shuttle / Time to travel hypotenuse \n\nTime to travel hypotenuse = sqrt((700m)^2 + Distance^2) / 17.5 m/s \n\nPutting it all together: \n\nDistance = Average speed x Total time \n\nDistance = (Length of shuttle / Time to travel hypotenuse) x (40s + 5s) \n\nDistance = (Length of shuttle / (sqrt((700m)^2 + Distance^2) / 17.5 m/s)) x 45s \n\nSimplifying: \n\nDistance = (Length of shuttle x 17.5 m/s x 45s) / sqrt((700m)^2 + Distance^2) \n\nSquaring both sides: \n\nDistance^2 = (Length of shuttle x 17.5 m/s x 45s)^2 / ((700m)^2 / Distance^2 + 1) \n\nMultiplying both sides by ((700m)^2 / Distance^2 + 1): \n\nDistance^2 x ((700m)^2 / Distance^2 + 1) = (Length of shuttle x 17.5 m/s x 45s)^2 \n\nExpanding: \n\n(700m)^2 + Distance^2 = (Length of shuttle x 17.5 m/s x 45s)^2 / Distance^2 \n\nMultiplying both sides by Distance^2: \n\n(700m)^2 x Distance^2 + Distance^4 = (Length of shuttle x 17.5 m/s x 45s)^2 \n\nSimplifying: \n\nDistance^4 - (Length of shuttle x 17.5 m/s x 45s)^2 + (700m)^2 x Distance^2 = 0 \n\nThis is a quadratic equation in Distance^2. We can solve for Distance^2 using the quadratic formula: \n\nDistance^2 = [-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a \n\nWhere a = 1, b = 0, and c = (Length of shuttle x 17.5 m/s x 45s)^2 - (700m)^2 \n\nPlugging in: \n\nDistance^2 = [-0 +/- sqrt(0^2 - 4(1)((Length of shuttle x 17.5 m/s x 45s)^2 - (700m)^2))] / 2(1) \n\nDistance^2 = [(Length of shuttle x 17.5 m/s x 45s)^2 - (700m)^2] / 2 \n\nNow we can plug in the answer choices and see which one gives us a valid distance: \n\n(A) 50 m: Distance^2 = (50m)^2 x 17.5 m/s x 45s)^2 - (700m)^2 / 2 = -1.5 x 10^9 (not valid) \n\n(B) 75 m: Distance^2 = (75m)^2 x 17.5 m/s x 45s)^2 - (700m)^2 / 2 = 1.5 x 10^9 (valid) \n\n(C) 100 m: Distance^2 = (100m)^2 x 17.5 m/s x 45s)^2 - (700m)^2 / 2 = 4.5 x 10^9 (not valid) \n\n(D) 125 m: Distance^2 = (125m)^2 x 17.5 m/s x 45s)^2 - (700m)^2 / 2 =",
