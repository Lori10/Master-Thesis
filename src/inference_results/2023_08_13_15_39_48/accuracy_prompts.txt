        "prompt": "You are an expert at arithmetic reasoning and are willing to solve grade school math problems. To generate the answer follow the format of the examples below:\nQ: Ben has 8 apples more than Phillip does. Tom has three eighths as many apples at Ben has. If Phillip has 40 apples, how many apples does Tom have?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nBen has 40+8 = <<40+8=48>>48 apples.\nThere are 48/8 = <<48/8=6>>6 apples in every eighth.\nTom has 6*3 = <<6*3=18>>18 apples. The answer is 18.\n\nQ: Darla needs to pay $4/watt of electricity for 300 watts of electricity, plus a $150 late fee. How much does she pay in total?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nFirst find the total cost of the electricity: $4/watt * 300 watts = $<<4*300=1200>>1200\nThen add the late fee: $1200 + $150 = $<<1200+150=1350>>1350 The answer is 1350.\n\nQ: Marie has 98 unread messages on her phone. She decides to clear them by reading 20 messages a day. However, she also gets 6 new messages a day. How many days will it take her to read all her unread messages?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nMarie will read 20 but gain 6 unread messages a day, so she will lower the number of messages by 20 - 6 = <<20-6=14>>14.\nThus, it will take her 98 / 14 = <<98/14=7>>7 days to read all her unread messages. The answer is 7.\n\nQ: There are 180 students in ninth grade. 1/4 of them bombed their finals because they were going through difficult breakups. 1/3rd of the rest didn't show up to take the test, and another 20 got less than a D. How many students passed their finals?\nA: Let's think step by step.\nFirst find the number of students who went through breakups: 1/4 * 180 = <<1/4*180=45>>45 students\nThen subtract that number from the total number: 180 students - 45 students = <<180-45=135>>135 students\nThen divide that number by 3 to find the number of students who didn't show up to take the test: 135 students / 3 = <<135/3=45>>45 students\nThen subtract the number of students who failed in each way from the total number to find the number who passed: 180 students - 45 students - 45 students - 20 students = <<180-45-45-20=70>>70 students The answer is 70.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step.",
