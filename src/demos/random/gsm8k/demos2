            "rationale": "Let's think step by step.\n'Since 40% of his students got below B, 100% - 40% = 60% of Mr. Sanchez's students got B and above.\nThus, 60 x 60/100 = <<60*60/100=36>>36 students got B and above in their final grade.",

Last month he sold eight large paintings and four small paintings. If he sold twice as much this month, how much is his sales for this month?\nA:",
            "rationale": "Let's think step by step.\n'Noah earned $60/large painting x 8 large paintings = $<<60*8=480>>480 for the large paintings.\nHe also earned $30/small painting x 4 small paintings = $<<30*4=120>>120 for the small paintings.\nHis total sales last month were $480 + $120 = $<<480+120=600>>600.\nSo, his sales this month are $600 x 2 = $<<600*2=1200>>1200.",
