The football management has decided to change the dimensions of field by increasing the breadth by 50% of its original value and reducing the length by 25% of its original value and fence the field again.. What will be the cost of the new fencing? Answer Choices: A)$360 B)$180 C)$425 D)$337.5 E)$415\nA:",
            "rationale": "Let's think step by step.\nLet's take x to be the breadth. Then the length of the football field is 3x.\nThe perimeter of the old football field is x + 3x + x + 3x = 8x.\nNow, for the new football field:\nThe new breadth = 1.5 times old breadth = 1.5x\nThe new length is 0.75 times old length = (.75)3x = 2.25x\nSo the new perimeter is 1.5x + 2.25x + 1.5x + 2.25x = 7.5 x.\nfor old perimeter rate is $360\nFor new perimeter = (360 * 7.5)/8\n= 337.5\nAns - D",
