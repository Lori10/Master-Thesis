If 90 are females, the other 180 â€“ 90 = 90 must be males. Similarly, the numbers in the â€œtotalsâ€ column must add up. If 40 are managers, then the other 180 â€“ 40 = 140 must be associates.\nNow, in the â€œassociateâ€ row, 135 + E = 140, which means E = 5 â€” the other 5 associates must be female.\nNow, to find B, which is what the question is asking, we need only look at the sum in the â€œfemaleâ€ column: B +5 = 90, which means B = 85. There are fifteen female managers in this company. Thus, the answer = (C).",

The single traffic lane is 12 feet wide and is equidistant from the sides of the tunnel. If vehicles must clear the top of the tunnel by at least ½ foot when they are inside the traffic lane, what should be the limit U on the height of vehicles that are allowed to use the tunnel? Answer Choices: (A) 5½ ft (B) 7½ ft (C) 8 ½ ft (D) 9½ ft (E) 10 ft",
            "rationale": "A: Let's think step by step.\nLet's label the midpoint of the circle O. Since the base of the semi-circle is 20, we know that the diameter is 20 and, accordingly, the radius is 10.\nWe also know that the traffic lane is 12 feet long and there's an equal amount of space on either side, so the traffic lane extends 6 feet on either side of O. Let's call the leftmost point on the base of the traffic lane A. So, the distance OA is 6.\nNow draw a line straight up from A to the top of the tunnel. Let's label the point at which the line intersects the circle B. The answer to the question will, therefore, be the height AB - .5 feet (we need to leave .5 feet of clearance).\nHere's the key to solving the question: if we draw a line from O to B, that line is a radius of the circle and, therefore, has length 10. We now have right triangle OAB (the right angle is at point A), with leg OA=6 and hypotenuse OB=10. We can now solve for leg AB=8 (either by applying the pythagorean theorum or by applying the 3/4/5 special right triangle ratio).\nFinally: AB=8, so the correct answer U is 8 - .5 = 7.5... choose (B)!\nFrom a strategic guessing point of view, as soon as we realize that the height of the tunnel is 10 in the middle, we should quickly eliminate (D) and (E) as too big; worse case you have a 1/3 shot at picking up the points.B",

A, B, and C are not solved (x^-n = 1/(x^n), so we're comparing integers to fractions), but choices D and E both end up valid, eliminating them from contention.\nIn the process of doing this, however, we've uncovered a major clue to our next step: A, B, and C, all compared integers to fractions, and the only integer equal to it's reciprocal is 1, which is equal to 1/1.

Divided by all possible permutations (=3!) yields 100.\nExplanation: For the first spot you have 10 possible canditates, for the 2nd 9. For the 3rd spot you need to differentiate if a senior partner has been picked for one of the first 2 spots or not. If yes, then you can pick one of the 8 remaining guys, so 10*9*8. If no senior partner has been picked yet, you need 10*9*4.\nNow you need to weight the 2 cases with the corresponding probabilities: probability of no senior partner being picked in the first 2 draws = 6/10*5/9=1/3, so you weight 10*9*4 with 1/3. For the complementary case (senior partner was picked in the first 2 draws) you just take the complementary prob (1-1/3)= 2/3 and weight 10*9*8 with it.\nNow you just need to divide the answer (600) by the number of different positions (=3!) and get W=600/6=100.B",
