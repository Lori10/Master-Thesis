Answer Choices: (A) 15% (B) 20% (C) 22.5% (D) 25% (E) 50%",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to calculate how much gasoline the car uses when it travels 8 miles on the highway. \n\nSince the car uses one gallon of gasoline every 40 miles on the highway, it will use 8/40 = 0.2 gallons of gasoline to travel 8 miles on the highway. \n\nNow, let's calculate how much gasoline the car uses when it travels 4 miles on the highway and 4 additional miles in the city. \n\nWhen the car travels 4 miles on the highway, it uses 1/40 = 0.025 gallons of gasoline. \n\nWhen the car travels 4 miles in the city, it uses 1/20 = 0.05 gallons of gasoline. \n\nTherefore, the total amount of gasoline used is 0.025 + 0.05 = 0.075 gallons. \n\nTo calculate the percentage increase in gasoline usage, we need to find the difference between the amount of gasoline used in the two scenarios and divide it by the amount of gasoline used when traveling 8 miles on the highway. \n\nThe difference is 0.075 - 0.2 = -0.125 gallons. \n\nSince we are looking for the percentage increase, we need to take the absolute value of the difference and divide it by the amount of gasoline used when traveling 8 miles on the highway: \n\n|-0.125| / 0.2 = 0.625 \n\nFinally, we need to convert this decimal to a percentage: \n\n0.625 x 100% = 62.5% \n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) 50%.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the salesman's sales be x. \n\nUnder the previous scheme, his commission would be 5% of x, which is 0.05x. \n\nUnder the new scheme, his commission on sales exceeding Rs. 4,000 would be 2.5% of (x-4000), which is 0.025(x-4000). \n\nIn addition, he has a fixed salary of Rs. 900. \n\nSo his remuneration under the new scheme would be:\n\n0.025(x-4000) + 900\n\nAnd we know that this is Rs. 600 more than his remuneration under the previous scheme, which was 0.05x. \n\nSo we can set up an equation:\n\n0.025(x-4000) + 900 = 0.05x + 600\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n0.025x - 100 + 900 = 0.05x + 600\n\n0.025x + 800 = 0.05x + 600\n\n0.025x = 200\n\nx = 8000\n\nTherefore, his sales were worth Rs. 8,000. \n\nNone of the above.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the time it takes to paint the first y houses at a rate of x houses per week.

This can be calculated as (80-y)/(1.25x) weeks.\n\nThe total time it takes to paint all the houses under this scenario is the sum of the time it takes to paint the first y houses and the time it takes to paint the remaining (80-y) houses. So, we have:\n\nC = y/x + (80-y)/(1.25x) weeks\n\nTo find the fraction of the time it would have taken if they had painted all the houses at their original rate of x houses per week, we need to divide C by the time it would have taken to paint all 80 houses at a rate of x houses per week. This can be calculated as 80/x weeks.\n\nSo, the fraction of the time it takes under this scenario is:\n\nC/(80/x) = (xy + 80x - 1.25xy)/(80x)\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nC/(80/x) = (80 - 0.25y)/80\n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) 80 - 0.25y.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the radius of the circular garden. We know that the diameter is 4 meters, so the radius is half of that, which is 2 meters.\n\nNext, we need to find the radius of the garden plus the width of the path. The width of the path is given as 25 cm, which is 0.25 meters. So, the radius of the garden plus the width of the path is 2 + 0.25 = 2.25 meters.\n\nNow, we can find the area of the path by subtracting the area of the garden from the area of the larger circle with radius 2.25 meters. The area of the garden is \u03c0r^2 = \u03c0(2)^2 = 4\u03c0 square meters. The area of the larger circle is \u03c0(2.25)^2 = 5.06\u03c0 square meters. So, the area of the path is 5.06\u03c0 - 4\u03c0 = 1.06\u03c0 square meters.\n\nFinally, we can approximate this value using 3.14 as an approximation for \u03c0. So, the area of the path is approximately 1.06 x 3.14 = 3.3244 square meters, which is closest to answer choice (A) 3.34 sq m. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 3.34 sq m.",

We can use the same formula, but with the new values:\n\nRate of one machine = 3x / (n * 6)\n\nwhere n is the number of machines needed.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the total number of positive integers less than 5000. This is simply 4999 (since we are not including 5000 itself).\n\nNext, we need to find the number of positive integers less than 5000 that are divisible by 17. We can do this by dividing 4999 by 17 (using integer division) to get 294. So there are 294 multiples of 17 less than 5000.\n\nSimilarly, we can find the number of positive integers less than 5000 that are divisible by 21. Dividing 4999 by 21 (using integer division) gives us 238. So there are 238 multiples of 21 less than 5000.\n\nHowever, we have counted some numbers twice - those that are multiples of both 17 and 21. To find the number of these, we need to find the multiples of the least common multiple of 17 and 21, which is 357. Dividing 4999 by 357 (using integer division) gives us 14. So there are 14 multiples of 357 less than 5000.\n\nTo find the number of positive integers less than 5000 that are divisible by neither 17 nor 21, we need to subtract the total number of multiples of 17 and 21 (counted twice) from the total number of positive integers less than 5000. So:\n\n4999 - (294 + 238 - 14) = 4957\n\nTherefore, there are 4957 positive integers less than 5000 that are evenly divisible by neither 17 nor 21.\n\nThe answer is (None of the above).",

So, we can write an equation as:\n\nx(x+1) = 1122\n\nExpanding the left side of the equation, we get:\n\nx^2 + x = 1122\n\nBringing all the terms to one side, we get:\n\nx^2 + x - 1122 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve this quadratic equation using factoring or the quadratic formula. However, we can also use estimation to get a rough idea of the answer.\n\nWe know that the product of two numbers is 1122, which is close to 1100. So, we can assume that the two numbers are close to the square root of 1100, which is around 33. \n\nLet's try x = 33.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We need to find the value of a+b+c, given the equation 28a+30b+31c=520.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n14a + 15b + 15.5c = 260\n\nNow, we can see that 14, 15, and 15.5 have a common factor of 0.5. So, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the decimal:\n\n28a + 30b + 31c = 520\n\nThis is the same equation we started with, but now it's easier to work with.\n\nNext, we can try to simplify the equation further by looking for common factors. We can see that 28, 30, and 31 have a common factor of 1, so we can write:\n\n28(a+b) + 31c = 520\n\nNow, we need to find values of a+b and c that satisfy this equation. We can start by trying different values of c and seeing what values of a+b work.\n\nIf we let c = 1, then we need to find values of a+b that satisfy:\n\n28(a+b) + 31 = 520\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n28(a+b) = 489\n\nDividing both sides by 28, we get:\n\na+b = 17.46\n\nThis is not a natural number, so we need to try a different value of c.\n\nIf we let c = 2, then we need to find values of a+b that satisfy:\n\n28(a+b) + 62 = 520\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n28(a+b) = 458\n\nDividing both sides by 28, we get:\n\na+b = 16.36\n\nAgain, this is not a natural number.

The problem is that 520 is not evenly divisible by 28, 30, or 31, so there are no values of a, b, and c that satisfy the equation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is None of the above.",

Let the length of the first train be a and the length of the second train be b. Then, we have:\n\na + b = (distance covered in 23 seconds)\n\nWhen the first train passes the man, it covers its own length and the distance between the man and the second train. Let the distance between the man and the second train be d. Then, we have:\n\na + d = (distance covered by the first train in 27 seconds)\n\nSimilarly, when the second train passes the man, it covers its own length and the distance between the man and the first train. So, we have:\n\nb + d = (distance covered by the second train in 17 seconds)\n\nNow, we can use these equations to solve for x and y. First, we can simplify the equation for the distance covered by the first train:\n\na + d = x * 27\n\na = x * 27 - d\n\nSimilarly, we can simplify the equation for the distance covered by the second train:\n\nb + d = y * 17\n\nb = y * 17 - d\n\nSubstituting these expressions for a and b into the equation for the sum of the lengths, we get:\n\n(x * 27 - d) + (y * 17 - d) = a + b = a + b = (distance covered in 23 seconds)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n27x + 17y = 2d + distance covered in 23 seconds\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the two trains cross each other in 23 seconds to write another equation:\n\n(distance covered in 23 seconds) = (speed of first train + speed of second train) * 23\n\nSubstituting the expressions for a and b into this equation, we get:\n\n(distance covered in 23 seconds) = (x + y) * 23\n\nSubstituting this expression into the previous equation, we get:\n\n27x + 17y = 2d + (x + y) * 23\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n4x - 6y = d\n\nNow, we have three equations:\n\na + d = x * 27\nb + d = y * 17\n4x - 6y = d\n\nWe can use these equations to solve for x and y. First, we can eliminate d by adding the first two equations:\n\na + b + 2d = x * 27 + y * 17\n\nSubstituting the expression for a + b from the equation for the sum of the lengths, we get:\n\n(x + y) * 23 + 2d = x * 27 + y * 17\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n4x - 6y = d\n\nSubstituting this expression for d, we get:\n\n(x + y) * 23 + 2(4x - 6y) = x * 27 + y * 17\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx = 3y\n\nSo, the ratio of their speeds is:\n\nx : y = 3 : 1\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) 1 : 3.",

So, the total age of the 6 remaining men is 8x-44. \n\nWhen we add the ages of the two women, the total age becomes (8x-44)+a+b. \n\nWe want to find the new average age, so we need to divide this total age by the new number of people, which is 8 (since we still have 8 people, just with 2 women instead of 2 men). \n\nSo, the new average age is [(8x-44)+a+b]/8. \n\nWe want to simplify this expression and solve for the average age of the two women, so let's start by distributing the division: \n\n[(8x-44)+a+b]/8 = (8x-44)/8 + (a+b)/8 \n\nWe know that the first term on the right side is the new average age of the 6 remaining men, which is x+2. So, we can substitute that in: \n\n(x+2) + (a+b)/8 = x+2 \n\nNow we can solve for (a+b)/8: \n\n(a+b)/8 = 0 \n\nThis means that the sum of the ages of the two women is 0, which is impossible. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) None of these.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the speed of the man in still water be x km/h and the speed of the current be y km/h. \n\nWhen the man swims downstream, his effective speed is (x+y) km/h. \n\nSimilarly, when he swims upstream, his effective speed is (x-y) km/h. \n\nWe know that he covers 45 km downstream and 25 km upstream, taking a total of 5 hours. \n\nUsing the formula distance = speed \u00d7 time, we can write two equations: \n\n45 = (x+y) \u00d7 t1 \n\n25 = (x-y) \u00d7 t2 \n\nwhere t1 and t2 are the time taken downstream and upstream respectively. \n\nWe also know that the total time taken is 5 hours, so: \n\nt1 + t2 = 5 \n\nWe have three equations and three variables (x, y, t1+t2), so we can solve for x. \n\nFrom the first equation, we get: \n\nt1 = 45/(x+y) \n\nFrom the second equation, we get: \n\nt2 = 25/(x-y) \n\nSubstituting these values in the third equation, we get: \n\n45/(x+y) + 25/(x-y) = 5 \n\nMultiplying both sides by (x+y)(x-y), we get: \n\n45(x-y) + 25(x+y) = 5(x+y)(x-y) \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n20x = 120 \n\nx = 6 \n\nTherefore, the speed of the man in still water is 6 km/h. \n\nNone of the above answer choices are correct.",

Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 10% (C) 15% (D) 20% (E) It can not be determined",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we know that the total number of flags is even, which means that both the number of blue and red flags must be even as well. Let's call the number of blue flags \"b\" and the number of red flags \"r\". Then we can write:\n\nb + r = even number\n\nNext, we know that each child picks up two flags, so the total number of children must be half the total number of flags. Let's call the total number of children \"c\". Then we can write:\n\nc = (b + r)/2\n\nWe also know that 60% of the children have blue flags, which means that the number of children with blue flags is 0.6c. Similarly, 45% of the children have red flags, which means that the number of children with red flags is 0.45c. Finally, we want to find the percentage of children with flags of both colors, which we can call \"x\". Then we can write:\n\nx% of c = number of children with both colors\n\nWe want to find x. \n\nNow, we can use the information we have to set up an equation. Since each child picks up two flags, the total number of flags picked up is 2c. We know that all the flags are used up, so we can write:\n\n2c = b + r\n\nSubstituting c = (b + r)/2, we get:\n\n2(b + r)/2 = b + r\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nb + r = 2b + 2r\n\nSubtracting b + r from both sides, we get:\n\n0 = b + r - 2b - 2r\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n-b - r = 0\n\nMultiplying both sides by -1, we get:\n\nb + r = 0\n\nBut we know that b + r is an even number, so the only way this equation can be true is if both b and r are 0. This means that there are no flags in the box, which is a contradiction. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct, and the correct answer is None of the above.",

However, we know that the standard deviation of the 1000 recorded amounts is 0.2 ounces. This means that the standard deviation of the sample of 12 listed amounts will be approximately equal to the standard deviation of the population of 1000 recorded amounts. Therefore, we can use the standard deviation of 0.2 ounces to calculate the range within which 1.5 standard deviations of the mean lie.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the range within which 1.5 standard deviations of the mean lie.\n1.5 standard deviations = 1.5 x 0.2 = 0.3 ounces\nLower limit = mean - 1.5 standard deviations = 8.06 - 0.3 = 7.76 ounces\nUpper limit = mean + 1.5 standard deviations = 8.06 + 0.3 = 8.36 ounces\n\nStep 4: Count the number of listed amounts that lie within the range.\nThere are five listed amounts that lie within the range of 7.76 to 8.36 ounces:\n7.86, 8.09, 7.83, 8.30, and 7.96\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Five.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the speed of the motor boat in still water be x kmph. \n\nWhen the boat goes upstream, its effective speed is (x - 1) kmph (since it is going against the current). \n\nWhen the boat goes downstream, its effective speed is (x + 1) kmph (since it is going with the current). \n\nWe know that the boat covers a total distance of 35 km upstream and 35 km downstream (i.e., a total distance of 70 km). \n\nWe also know that the total time taken is 12 hours. \n\nUsing the formula: \n\ntime = distance / speed \n\nWe can write two equations: \n\n35 / (x - 1) + 35 / (x + 1) = 12 \n\nMultiplying both sides by (x - 1)(x + 1), we get: \n\n35(x + 1) + 35(x - 1) = 12(x - 1)(x + 1) \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n70x = 12(x^2 - 1) \n\nSimplifying further, we get: \n\n12x^2 - 70x - 12 = 0 \n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get: \n\n6x^2 - 35x - 6 = 0 \n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get: \n\nx = (35 \u00b1 \u221a(35^2 + 4*6*6)) / (2*6) \n\nx = (35 \u00b1 \u221a1361) / 12 \n\nx \u2248 6.98 or x \u2248 -0.85 \n\nSince the speed of the boat cannot be negative, we take x \u2248 6.98. \n\nTherefore, the speed of the motor boat in still water is approximately 7 kmph. \n\nThe correct answer is (B) 7.",

Similarly, machine Q can print 1/10th of the work in 1 hour, and machine R can print 1/12th of the work in 1 hour.\n\nAll machines started printing at 9 A.M., so they worked together for 2 hours until 11 A.M.

The hare starts after the tortoise has covered 1/5 of its distance and that too leisurely. The hare and tortoise meet when the hare has covered only 1/8 of the distance. By what factor should the hare increase its speed so as to tie the race? Answer Choices: (A) 37.9 (B) 37.2 (C) 37.1 (D) 37.82 (E) 37.8",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the total distance of the race is 100 yards. \n\nThe tortoise covers 1/5 of the distance, which is 20 yards, before the hare starts. \n\nLet's say that the hare's speed is x yards per second. \n\nWhen the hare has covered 1/8 of the distance, it has covered 100/8 = 12.5 yards. \n\nAt this point, the tortoise has covered 20 + 12.5 = 32.5 yards. \n\nSince the hare and tortoise are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds. \n\nSo, the hare's relative speed is x + (1/5)x = 6/5 x yards per second. \n\nThe time taken for the hare and tortoise to meet is the distance between them divided by their relative speed. \n\nSo, (100 - 32.5) / (6/5 x) = 7.5 / x seconds. \n\nNow, we know that the hare covers 1/8 of the distance in this time. \n\nSo, 100/8 = 12.5 = (7.5 / x) * x / 8 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get x = 30 yards per second. \n\nThe hare's initial speed was 1/5 of this, which is 6 yards per second. \n\nTo tie the race, the hare needs to cover the remaining 7/8 of the distance at this speed. \n\nSo, the time taken would be (7/8 * 100) / 6 = 87.5 / 6 seconds. \n\nNow, we can calculate the time taken by the tortoise to cover the entire distance, which is 100 / (1/5) = 500 seconds. \n\nSo, the hare needs to cover the remaining distance in 500 - 87.5 / 6 = 355 / 3 seconds. \n\nThe hare's required speed is the distance divided by time, which is (7/8 * 100) / (355/3) = 105 / 8 yards per second. \n\nSo, the factor by which the hare needs to increase its speed is 105 / 8 / 6 = 35 / 16 = 2.1875. \n\nNone of the above answer choices are correct.",

So, we can write:\n\ntime taken at 144 km/h = d / 144\n\ntime taken at 100 km/h = (d / 100) + 24 minutes (4/15 hour)\n\ntime taken at required speed = (d / x) (let's assume the required speed to be 'x' km/h)\n\nNow, we know that the train should reach the destination on schedule, which means the time taken at the required speed should be equal to the scheduled time. So, we can write:\n\n(d / 144) - (1/3) = (d / x)\n\n(d / 100) + (4/15) = (d / x)\n\nWe can solve these two equations to get the value of 'x'. One way to do this is to eliminate 'd' from the equations. \n\nMultiplying the first equation by 100x and the second equation by 144x, we get:\n\n100x(d/144) - (100x/3) = d\n\n144x(d/100) + (96x/15) = d\n\nEquating the two expressions for 'd', we get:\n\n100x(d/144) - (100x/3) = 144x(d/100) + (96x/15)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nd = 720x/17\n\nSubstituting this value of 'd' in one of the earlier equations, we get:\n\n(720x/17) / 144 - (1/3) = (720x/17) / x\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx = 240 km/h\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 240.",

Simplifying this expression, we get y = x^(3/2)/(x - z) and z = x^(1/2)/(x - z).\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions for y and z into the ratio y^2 : x : z to get x^(3/2)/(x - z)^2 : x : x^(1/2)/(x - z).

If the x- and y-coordinates of A, B, and C are to be integers that are consistent with the inequalities -8 \u2264 x \u2264 2 and 4 \u2264 y \u2264 9 , then how many different triangles can be drawn that will meet these conditions? Answer Choices: (A) 54 (B) 4032 (C) 2,160 (D) 2,916 (E) 148,824",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the possible values of the coordinates of point A. Since AB is parallel to the y-axis, the x-coordinate of A must be between -8 and 2, inclusive. The y-coordinate of A must be between 4 and 9, inclusive. Therefore, there are 11 possible values for the x-coordinate and 6 possible values for the y-coordinate, giving us a total of 66 possible points A.\n\nNext, we need to find the possible values of the coordinates of point B. Since AB is parallel to the y-axis, the x-coordinate of B must be the same as the x-coordinate of A. The y-coordinate of B must be between 4 and the y-coordinate of A, inclusive. Therefore, for each possible point A, there are (yA - 4 + 1) possible points B.\n\nFinally, we need to find the possible values of the coordinates of point C. Since C is the right angle of the triangle, it must be on the circle with diameter AB. The center of this circle is the midpoint of AB, which has coordinates ((xA + xB)/2, (yA + yB)/2). The radius of the circle is half the length of AB, which is |yA - yB|/2. Therefore, the equation of the circle is:\n\n(x - (xA + xB)/2)^2 + (y - (yA + yB)/2)^2 = (yA - yB)^2/4\n\nWe need to find the integer points on this circle that satisfy the inequalities -8 \u2264 x \u2264 2 and 4 \u2264 y \u2264 9. This can be done by brute force, but it's easier to notice that the circle is symmetric with respect to the line x = (xA + xB)/2. Therefore, we only need to find the integer points on one side of the circle and multiply by 2.\n\nFor each possible pair of points A and B, we need to find the integer points on the circle that satisfy the inequalities. This can be done by plugging in the values of x and solving for y, or vice versa. Since the equation of the circle involves squares, there may be multiple solutions for each value of x. However, we only need to count the distinct solutions.\n\nOnce we have the number of possible points C for each pair of points A and B, we can sum them up to get the total number of triangles. The answer is:\n\n66 * sum((yA - 4 + 1) * count(x) * 2 for x in range(xA, xA + 1) for yA in range(4, 9 + 1) for yB in range(4, yA + 1) if (xA + xB) % 2 == 0 and (yA - yB) % 2 == 0 and (xA - 2*yA + xB + 2*yB) % 4 == 0)\n\nThis evaluates to 2,160, so the answer is (C) 2,160.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we can use the ratio of Yankees fans to Mets fans to set up an equation. Let x be the number of Yankees fans and y be the number of Mets fans. Then we have:\n\nx/y = 2/1\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx = 2y\n\nNext, we can use the ratio of Mets fans to Red Sox fans to set up another equation. Let z be the number of Red Sox fans. Then we have:\n\ny/z = 3/7\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nz = (7/3)y\n\nNow we can use the fact that there are 320 baseball fans in the town to set up a third equation:\n\nx + y + z = 320\n\nSubstituting the expressions we found for x and z in terms of y, we get:\n\n2y + y + (7/3)y = 320\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n(16/3)y = 320\n\ny = 60\n\nTherefore, there are 60 NY Mets fans in this town.

            "Question": "Q: When m is divided by 9, the remainder is 8. When m is divided by 13, the remainder is 1. If 1 < m < 200, what is the greatest possible value of m? Answer Choices: (A) 47 (B) 65 (C) 103 (D) 117 (E) 170",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we can write two equations based on the given information:\n\nm = 9a + 8 (where a is an integer)\nm = 13b + 1 (where b is an integer)\n\nWe want to find the greatest possible value of m, which means we want to maximize m. One way to do this is to find the smallest values of a and b that satisfy both equations, and then use those values to calculate m.\n\nTo do this, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. This tells us that there is a unique solution to the system of equations m = 9a + 8 and m = 13b + 1, modulo 9*13 = 117. In other words, we can find a value of m that satisfies both equations by finding a value of m that is congruent to 8 modulo 9 and congruent to 1 modulo 13, and that is between 1 and 200.\n\nTo find such a value, we can start by finding the modular inverse of 13 modulo 9. This is the smallest positive integer k such that 13k is congruent to 1 modulo 9. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find k:\n\n9 = 13*(-1) + 22\n13 = 22*0 + 13\n22 = 13*1 + 9\n13 = 9*1 + 4\n9 = 4*2 + 1\n\nSince the last remainder is 1, we know that 9 and 13 are relatively prime, and therefore there exists a modular inverse of 13 modulo 9. We can work backwards through the Euclidean algorithm to find it:\n\n1 = 9 - 4*2\n1 = 9 - (13 - 9*1)*2\n1 = 9*3 - 13*2\n\nTherefore, the modular inverse of 13 modulo 9 is -2 (or 7, if we want a positive integer).\n\nNow we can use this to find a value of m that satisfies both equations:\n\nm = 9a + 8\nm = 13b + 1\n\n13b + 1 = 9a + 8\n13b = 9a + 7\nb = 7a + 5 (mod 9)\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\nm = 13(7a + 5) + 1\nm = 91a + 68\n\nNow we want to find the largest value of m that is between 1 and 200 and congruent to 68 modulo 91. We can do this by subtracting 68 from 200 and finding the largest multiple of 91 that is less than or equal to the result:\n\n200 - 68 = 132\n132 = 91*1 + 41\n132 = 91*2 - 49\n132 = 91*3 - 140\n132 = 91*4 - 203\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of m is 91*4 + 68 = 372. However, this is greater than 200, so we need to subtract 91 from it to get a value that is between 1 and 200:\n\n372 - 91 = 281\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of m is 281, which is not one of the answer choices. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the above.",

For the first die, there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) and 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5). For the second die, the same is true. So we can use a table to count the number of outcomes where the sum is even:\n\n|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| 2 |   | X |   | X |   | X |\n| 3 |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| 4 |   | X |   | X |   | X |\n| 5 |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| 6 |   | X |   | X |   | X |\n\nEach X represents an outcome where the sum is even.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the sum of the first 50 positive even integers. We know that the first even integer is 2, the second is 4, the third is 6, and so on. So, we can write the sum as:\n\n2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 98 + 100 = 2550\n\nNext, we need to find the sum of the even integers from 302 to 400 inclusive. We can start by finding the sum of all even integers from 2 to 400, and then subtracting the sum of all even integers from 2 to 300. This will give us the sum of even integers from 302 to 400.\n\nThe sum of all even integers from 2 to 400 can be found using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nS = (n/2)(a + l)\n\nwhere S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term.\n\nIn this case, a = 2, l = 400, and n = (400 - 2)/2 + 1 = 200.

However, if an answer is incorrectly marked, the test-taker loses 0.25 points. No points are awarded or deducted if a question is not attempted. A certain group of test-takers attempted different numbers of questions, but each test-taker still received the same net score of 40. What is the maximum possible number of such test-takers? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 10 (C) 11 (D) 12 (E) 13",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the maximum possible score a test-taker can get. Since there are 100 questions and each correct answer is worth 1 point, the maximum possible score is 100.\n\nNext, we need to find the minimum possible score a test-taker can get. If a test-taker attempts all 100 questions and gets all of them wrong, they will lose 0.25 points for each incorrect answer. Therefore, the minimum possible score is 100 - (0.25 x 100) = 75.\n\nSince each test-taker received a net score of 40, we can set up an equation to find the total number of questions attempted by all test-takers:\n\n40 = (number of correct answers x 1) - (number of incorrect answers x 0.25)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n40 = number of correct answers - 0.25 x (total number of questions attempted - number of correct answers)\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\n40 = number of correct answers - 0.25 x total number of questions attempted + 0.25 x number of correct answers\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n40 = 1.25 x number of correct answers - 0.25 x total number of questions attempted\n\nWe know that the number of correct answers cannot be greater than 100, and the total number of questions attempted cannot be less than 75. Therefore, we can set up the following inequalities:\n\nnumber of correct answers \u2264 100\ntotal number of questions attempted \u2265 75\n\nWe can use these inequalities to find the maximum possible number of test-takers. We can start by assuming that all test-takers attempted the minimum number of questions required to get a net score of 40 (i.e., they got all the questions they attempted correct). In this case, each test-taker attempted 40 questions and got all of them correct, so the total number of test-takers would be:\n\ntotal number of test-takers = 100 / 40 = 2.5\n\nHowever, we know that the number of test-takers must be a whole number, so we need to round up to the nearest integer. Therefore, the minimum possible number of test-takers is 3.\n\nNext, we need to see if it is possible for more test-takers to have attempted more questions while still getting a net score of 40. We can do this by assuming that some test-takers attempted more questions and got some of them wrong, while others attempted fewer questions and got all of them correct. For example, if one test-taker attempted 50 questions and got 45 of them correct, and another test-taker attempted 30 questions and got all of them correct, their net scores would be:\n\ntest-taker 1: 45 x 1 - 5 x 0.25 = 42.25\ntest-taker 2: 30 x 1 = 30\n\nThe total number of questions attempted by these two test-takers would be 80, and their total net score would be 72.25. We can see that it is possible for more test-takers to have attempted more questions while still getting a net score of 40.\n\nTo find the maximum possible number of test-takers, we need to find the largest number of test-takers who could have attempted more questions while still getting a net score of 40. We can do this by assuming that all test-takers attempted the same number of questions, and then finding the maximum number of test-takers who could have gotten that number of questions correct while still getting a net score of 40.\n\nLet's assume that each test-taker attempted n questions. If they got all of them correct, their score would be n. If they got k of them wrong, their score would be n - 0.25k. We know that their net score is 40, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n40 = (number of correct answers x 1) - (number of incorrect answers x 0.25)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n40 = n - 0.25k\n\nWe also know that the total number of questions attempted by all test-takers is:\n\ntotal number of questions attempted = n x number of test-takers\n\nWe can use these two equations to find the maximum possible number of test-takers. We can start by assuming that each test-taker attempted the minimum number of questions required to get a net score of 40 (i.e., they got all the questions they attempted correct). In this case, we have:\n\n40 = n\ntotal number of questions attempted = 100\n\nSubstituting n = 40 into the second equation, we get:\n\ntotal number of questions attempted = 40 x number of test-takers\n\n100 = 40 x number of test-takers\n\nnumber of test-takers = 2.5\n\nAs before, we need to round",

However, we can use the fact that the sum of their current ages is 2 times the average of their ages: \n\na + b + c = 2(average age) \n\na + b + c = 2(46) \n\na + b + c = 92 \n\nSubstituting a + b = 90, we get: \n\n90 + c = 92 \n\nc = 2 \n\nNow we know that the current age of C is 2. Substituting this into b + c = 92, we get: \n\nb + 2 = 92 \n\nb = 90 \n\nTherefore, the current age of B is 90. \n\nTen years hence, the age of B will be: \n\nb + 10 = 90 + 10 = 100 \n\nNone of the above answer choices are correct.",

The net rate at which the tank is being filled or emptied is: \n\n1/20 - 1/15 = -1/60 (tank/minute) \n\nThis means that the tank is being emptied at a rate of 1/60 tank per minute. \n\nFor the next 2 minutes, pipes B and C are open. The net rate at which the tank is being filled or emptied is: \n\n1/30 - 1/15 = 1/60 (tank/minute) \n\nThis means that the tank is being filled at a rate of 1/60 tank per minute. \n\nFor the next 2 minutes, pipes A and C are open again. The net rate at which the tank is being filled or emptied is: \n\n1/20 - 1/15 = -1/60 (tank/minute) \n\nThis means that the tank is being emptied at a rate of 1/60 tank per minute. \n\nWe can see that the net rate of filling the tank is zero after every 6 minutes (2 minutes for each combination of pipes). This means that the tank is not being filled or emptied during these intervals. \n\nTherefore, we need to find how many 6-minute intervals are required to fill the tank. \n\nLet's assume that the tank has a capacity of 60 liters (this is just an assumption to make the calculations easier). \n\nThe tank will be filled in the following way: \n\n- During the first 6 minutes, the tank is emptied by 1 liter (1/60 tank per minute for 6 minutes). \n- During the next 6 minutes, the tank is filled by 2 liters (1/60 tank per minute for 6 minutes). \n- During the next 6 minutes, the tank is emptied by 1 liter (1/60 tank per minute for 6 minutes). \n- During the next 6 minutes, the tank is filled by 2 liters. \n- And so on... \n\nWe can see that the tank is filled by 1 liter every 6 minutes. \n\nTherefore, to fill a 60-liter tank, we need 60/1 = 60 six-minute intervals = 6 hours. \n\nSo, the correct answer is (E) 6 hours.",

Answer Choices: (A) 30 m/s, 40 m/s (B) 32 m/s, 48 m/s (C) 40 m/s, 44 m/s (D) 38 m/s, 42 m/s (E) None of these",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let the speed of the faster train be x m/s and the speed of the slower train be y m/s.\n\nWhen they are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is (x-y) m/s. The distance to be covered is the sum of the lengths of the two trains, which is 130+110=240 meters.\n\nTherefore, using the formula distance = speed \u00d7 time, we get:\n\n240 = (x-y) \u00d7 60   (since time is given in minutes)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n4x - 3y = 16    (equation 1)\n\nWhen they are moving in opposite directions, the relative speed is (x+y) m/s. The distance to be covered is the sum of the lengths of the two trains, which is again 240 meters.\n\nTherefore, using the same formula, we get:\n\n240 = (x+y) \u00d7 3   (since time is given in seconds)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx + y = 80    (equation 2)\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables. Solving them simultaneously, we get:\n\nx = 38 m/s and y = 42 m/s\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 38 m/s, 42 m/s.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the length of the train. Let's assume that the length of the train is 'x' meters.\n\nNow, we know that the train passes the platform in 45 seconds. So, the distance covered by the train in 45 seconds is equal to the length of the train.\n\nWe also know that the speed of the train is 54 km/hr. We need to convert this to meters per second to match the units of distance. \n\n54 km/hr = (54 * 1000) / (60 * 60) m/s = 15 m/s\n\nTherefore, the distance covered by the train in 45 seconds is 15 * 45 = 675 meters.\n\nSo, we can write the equation: \n\nx = 675\n\nNext, we need to find the length of the platform. Let's assume that the length of the platform is 'y' meters.\n\nNow, we know that the train passes a man standing on the platform in 20 seconds. So, the distance covered by the train in 20 seconds is equal to the length of the train plus the length of the platform.\n\nWe can write the equation:\n\nx + y = distance covered by the train in 20 seconds\n\nWe already know that the distance covered by the train in 20 seconds is (54 * 1000) / (60 * 60) * 20 = 600 meters.\n\nSo, we can write the equation:\n\nx + y = 600\n\nSubstituting the value of x from the first equation, we get:\n\n675 + y = 600\n\ny = 600 - 675\n\ny = -75\n\nThis is not a possible answer as the length of the platform cannot be negative. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is None of the above.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the combined rate of filling of taps A, B, and C. \n\nLet's assume the tank has a capacity of 60 units (LCM of 12, 15, and 20). \n\nTap A can fill the tank in 12 hours, so its rate of filling is 60/12 = 5 units per hour. \n\nTap B can fill the tank in 15 hours, so its rate of filling is 60/15 = 4 units per hour. \n\nTap C can fill the tank in 20 hours, so its rate of filling is 60/20 = 3 units per hour. \n\nTherefore, the combined rate of filling of taps A, B, and C is 5 + 4 + 3 = 12 units per hour. \n\nNow, we need to find how long it takes for the tank to be filled when A is open all the time and B and C are open for one hour each alternately. \n\nIn the first hour, B and C are open alternately, so their combined rate of filling is 4 + 3 = 7 units per hour. \n\nIn the second hour, B and C are open alternately again, so their combined rate of filling is 4 + 3 = 7 units per hour. \n\nIn the third hour, B and C are open alternately again, so their combined rate of filling is 4 + 3 = 7 units per hour. \n\nIn the fourth hour, B and C are open alternately again, so their combined rate of filling is 4 + 3 = 7 units per hour. \n\nIn the fifth hour, only tap A is open, so its rate of filling is 5 units per hour. \n\nTherefore, the total rate of filling in 5 hours is 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 5 = 33 units. \n\nSince the tank has a capacity of 60 units, we need to fill the remaining 27 units. \n\nAt a combined rate of 4 + 3 = 7 units per hour, it will take 27/7 = 3.86 hours to fill the remaining part of the tank. \n\nTherefore, the total time taken to fill the tank is 5 + 3.86 = 8.86 hours, which is approximately 8 hours and 52 minutes. \n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) 8 hours.",

Answer Choices: (A) 2 minute and 12 seconds. (B) two minutes. (C) 44 seconds. (D) 20 seconds. (E) 12 seconds.",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find Jerry's speed. Since Jerry is running 36% slower than Tom, his speed is 0.64 times Tom's speed. Therefore, Jerry's speed is:\n\nJerry's speed = 0.64 x 2.5 = 1.6 meters per second\n\nNext, we need to find the combined speed of Tom and Jerry. Since they are running towards each other, we add their speeds:\n\nCombined speed = Tom's speed + Jerry's speed = 2.5 + 1.6 = 4.1 meters per second\n\nNow, we can use the formula:\n\ndistance = speed x time\n\nWe know the initial distance between Tom and Jerry is 50 meters. Let's call the time it takes for them to meet W. We also know that Tom started running 20 seconds before Jerry did.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the probability that Martha correctly guesses a person's height and weight for one person. \n\nFor height, the probability is 5/6, since she guesses correctly 5 times out of 6. \n\nFor weight, the probability is 6/8, which simplifies to 3/4. \n\nTo find the probability that she correctly guesses both height and weight for one person, we multiply the probabilities: \n\n5/6 * 3/4 = 15/24 = 5/8 \n\nNow, we need to find the probability that she correctly guesses both height and weight for at least one person out of three. \n\nWe can use the complement rule and find the probability that she doesn't correctly guess both height and weight for any of the three people, and then subtract that from 1. \n\nThe probability that she doesn't correctly guess both height and weight for one person is: \n\n1 - 5/8 = 3/8 \n\nSo, the probability that she doesn't correctly guess both height and weight for any of the three people is: \n\n(3/8)^3 = 27/512 \n\nTherefore, the probability that she correctly guesses both height and weight for at least one person out of three is: \n\n1 - 27/512 = 485/512 \n\nThe answer is (C) 485/512.",

This can be done using the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is nPr = n!/(n-r)!. Here, we have 3 vowels, so n = 3.\n\nnPr = 3!/(3-3)! = 3!\n\n= 6\n\nSo, the total number of arrangements where the vowels always come together is:\n\n720 x 6 = 4,320\n\nFinally, we need to subtract the number of arrangements where the vowels are together from the total number of arrangements to get the number of arrangements where the vowels are never together.\n\n40,320 - 4,320 = 36,000\n\nTherefore, the answer is (None of the above) as none of the given options match the correct answer of 36,000.",

So, the new time taken to fill the cistern is 4 + 2 = 6 hours. \n\nLet's assume that the leak can empty the cistern in x hours. \n\nNow, we can set up an equation based on the principle that the amount of water filled in the cistern is equal to the amount of water emptied by the leak when the cistern is full. \n\nAmount of water filled = Amount of water emptied \n\nRate of filling x Time taken to fill = Rate of emptying x Time taken to empty \n\n1 = (1/4) x 6 + (1/x) x t \n\nwhere t is the time taken to empty the cistern when it is full. \n\nSimplifying the equation, we get: \n\n1 = (3/2) + (t/x) \n\n(t/x) = 1/2 \n\nt = (x/2) \n\nSo, the time taken to empty the cistern when it is full is half the time taken by the leak to empty it. \n\nSince we don't know the time taken by the leak to empty the cistern, we cannot determine the exact answer. \n\nTherefore, the answer is None of the above.",

We can write this as:\n\nh(100) = 4 * 6 * 8 * ... * 100\n\nWe can simplify this expression by factoring out 2 from each term:\n\nh(100) = 2^50 * (2 * 3 * 4 * ... * 50)\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest prime factor of h(100) + 4.

We know that the tax is levied on 75% of the cultivated land, but we don't know what percentage of the total land is cultivated.

We know that he owns some percentage of the total land in the village, and that he paid 75% of the tax on his cultivated land. So, we can set up an equation:\n\n0.75x * p = 480\n\nwhere x is the total cultivated land in the village (as a percentage of the total land), and p is the percentage of the total land that Mr. William owns.\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 480 / (0.75 * p)\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the total tax collected in the village is $3840. We know that this tax is levied on 75% of the cultivated land, so we can set up another equation:\n\n0.75 * total_cultivated_land * x = 3840\n\nwhere total_cultivated_land is the total cultivated land in the village (as a percentage of the total land).\n\nSolving for total_cultivated_land, we get:\n\ntotal_cultivated_land = 3840 / (0.75 * x)\n\nNow, we can use both of these equations to find the percentage of the total land that Mr. William owns:\n\np = (total_cultivated_land * x * p) / 100\n\nSubstituting in the values we found earlier, we get:\n\np = (3840 / (0.75 * x)) * x * p / 100\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\np = 16.667%\n\nSo, the answer is (E) 16.667%.",

After the second game, there will be 48 players left, and so on. \n\nSo, the number of games played can be calculated by subtracting 1 from the number of players in each round and adding up the results. \n\nFor example, in the first round, there are 50 players, so there are 50-1=49 games played. In the second round, there are 49 players left, so there are 49-1=48 games played. \n\nContinuing this pattern, we get:\n\n49 + 48 + 47 + ... + 2 + 1\n\nThis is an arithmetic series with a common difference of -1 and a first term of 49. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the total number of games:\n\nS = (n/2)(a + l)\n\nwhere S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term. \n\nIn this case, n = 50 (the number of players), a = 49 (the number of games in the first round), and l = 1 (the number of games in the last round). \n\nS = (50/2)(49 + 1) = 25(50) = 1250\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 25.",

This means that the customer is paying for 100g less than what they think they are paying for. \n\nTo calculate the profit percentage, we need to find the profit made by the shopkeeper. \n\nProfit = Selling price - Cost price \n\nCost price = $100 (as assumed earlier) \n\nSelling price = $108 \n\nProfit = $108 - $100 = $8 \n\nNow, we need to calculate the profit percentage. \n\nProfit percentage = (Profit / Cost price) x 100 \n\nProfit percentage = (8 / 100) x 100 = 8% \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) 8%.",

From the time the first paperback copy was sold until the last copy of the novel was sold 9 times as many paperback copies as hardback copies were sold. If a total of 440,000 copies of the novel were sold in all, how many paperback copies were sold? Answer Choices: (A) 45,000 (B) 360,000 (C) 364,500 (D) 363,600 (E) 396,900",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Step 1: Let's call the number of hardback copies sold \"h\" and the number of paperback copies sold \"p\". We know that h + p = 440,000 (since that's the total number of copies sold).\n\nStep 2: We also know that there were 36,000 hardback copies sold before the paperback version was issued. So, the number of paperback copies sold must be 9 times the number of hardback copies sold after the first 36,000. In other words, p = 9(h - 36,000).\n\nStep 3: Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get: h + 9(h - 36,000) = 440,000.\n\nStep 4: Simplifying the equation, we get: 10h - 324,000 = 440,000.\n\nStep 5: Solving for h, we get: h = 76,400.\n\nStep 6: Now we can use the second equation to find p: p = 9(h - 36,000) = 9(76,400 - 36,000) = 364,000.\n\nStep 7: Adding h and p together, we get: 76,400 + 364,000 = 440,400.\n\nStep 8: Since the total number of copies sold is 440,000, we need to subtract the extra 400 copies to get the final answer: 440,400 - 400 = 440,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) 364,500.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "We know that each cabbage takes up 1 square foot of area in the garden. Let's assume that the area of the garden is x square feet. \n\nTherefore, the number of cabbages she produced last year would be x. \n\nThis year, she has increased her output by 199 cabbages. So, the number of cabbages she produced this year would be x + 199. \n\nWe also know that the shape of the area used for growing the cabbages has remained a square in both these years. \n\nSo, we can set up an equation: \n\nx = side length of the square last year \nx + 199 = side length of the square this year \n\nSince the area of a square is side length squared, we can set up another equation: \n\nx^2 = number of cabbages produced last year \n(x + 199)^2 = number of cabbages produced this year \n\nExpanding the second equation: \n\n(x + 199)^2 = x^2 + 398x + 199^2 \n\nWe know that the number of cabbages produced this year is an integer, so we need to find a perfect square that is close to x^2 + 398x + 199^2. \n\nLet's try option (D) 12,696: \n\nx^2 + 398x + 199^2 = 12,696 \n\nSolving for x using the quadratic formula: \n\nx = (-398 \u00b1 sqrt(398^2 - 4(1)(199^2 - 12,696))) / 2(1) \n\nx = (-398 \u00b1 sqrt(158116)) / 2 \n\nx = (-398 \u00b1 398) / 2 \n\nx = 0 or -199 \n\nSince the side length of the square cannot be negative, option (D) is not correct. \n\nLet's try option (B) 11,025: \n\nx^2 + 398x + 199^2 = 11,025 \n\nSolving for x using the quadratic formula: \n\nx = (-398 \u00b1 sqrt(398^2 - 4(1)(199^2 - 11,025))) / 2(1) \n\nx = (-398 \u00b1 sqrt(152100)) / 2 \n\nx = (-398 \u00b1 390) / 2 \n\nx = -4 or 392 \n\nSince the side length of the square cannot be negative, the only valid solution is x = 392. \n\nTherefore, the number of cabbages produced this year is (x + 199)^2 = (392 + 199)^2 = 14,400. \n\nSo, the answer is (C) 14,400.",

If all of them start from start line and finish the entire 50 cm, how many insects were still left after the race was over? Answer Choices: (A) 0 (B) 4 (C) 6 (D) 8 (E) 11",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The first frog jumps 2 cm in every leap, so it will eat insects at positions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, and 48.\n\nThe second frog jumps 3 cm in every leap, so it will eat insects at positions 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, and 48.\n\nThe third frog jumps 4 cm in every leap, so it will eat insects at positions 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48.\n\nAnd so on, until the ninth frog jumps 10 cm in every leap, so it will eat insects only at position 50.\n\nTo find out how many insects were eaten in total, we need to add up the number of insects eaten by each frog.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the volume of water displaced by the boat before the man gets on it. This can be calculated using the formula:\n\nVolume = length x breadth x height\n\nHere, the height is the depth to which the boat sinks in the water. Since the boat sinks by 1 cm (or 0.01 m), the height is 0.01 m. Therefore, the volume of water displaced by the boat is:\n\nVolume = 8 x 3 x 0.01 = 0.24 cubic meters\n\nNow, when the man gets on the boat, the boat sinks further by some amount. Let's say the boat sinks by h meters. Then, the new volume of water displaced by the boat is:\n\nNew Volume = 8 x 3 x h\n\nSince the boat is floating on the water, the weight of the boat and the man is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the boat. Therefore, we can equate the weight of the water displaced before and after the man gets on the boat:\n\nDensity of water x Volume x g = Density of water x New Volume x g\n\nHere, g is the acceleration due to gravity and is equal to 9.8 m/s^2. The density of water is approximately 1000 kg/m^3.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nVolume x g = New Volume x g\n\n0.24 x 9.8 = 8 x 3 x h x 9.8\n\nh = 0.24/(8 x 3) = 0.01 m\n\nTherefore, the boat sinks by an additional 0.01 m when the man gets on it.\n\nNow, we can use the concept of buoyancy to find the mass of the man. The buoyant force acting on the boat is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the boat. This buoyant force is also equal to the weight of the boat and the man combined, since they are floating on the water.\n\nLet's say the mass of the boat is M kg. Then, the weight of the boat is Mg newtons. The weight of the man is W newtons, where W = mg, where m is the mass of the man in kg and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\nMg + W = Density of water x Volume x g\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nMg + mg = 1000 x 0.24 x 9.8\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nm = 89 kg\n\nTherefore, the mass of the man is 89 kg. The correct answer is (C) 89 Kg.",

And if he had sold it for 6 less, the selling price would be 1.15x - 6.\n\nAccording to the question, if he had done this, he would have gained 25%.

Let's call this beneficiary A. \n\nNext, we know that no one among the sons can receive an amount within 12% of another's amount. This means that the difference between any two amounts must be at least 12% of the larger amount. \n\nLet's assume that beneficiary A received the largest amount. Then, the smallest amount that any other beneficiary can receive is $30,000 - 12% of $30,000 = $26,400. \n\nNow, we need to divide the remaining estate among the other five sons such that the difference between any two amounts is at least 12% of the larger amount. \n\nTo minimize the range between the highest and lowest amounts, we want to distribute the remaining estate as equally as possible among the five sons. \n\nSo, we divide the remaining estate (total estate - $30,000) by 5 to get the amount that each of the other five sons will receive. Let's call this amount x. \n\nThen, we know that the smallest amount that any of the other five sons can receive is $26,400, which means that the largest amount that any of the other five sons can receive is $30,000 + 12% of $30,000 = $33,600. \n\nSo, we have the following equation: \n\n$26,400 + 5x + $30,000 = $33,600 * 5 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n5x = $63,000 - $26,400 - $30,000 = $6,600 \n\nx = $1,320 \n\nTherefore, the six sons will receive the following amounts: \n\nA: $30,000 \nB: $33,600 \nC: $33,600 \nD: $33,600 \nE: $33,600 \nF: $1,320 \n\nThe range between the highest and lowest amounts is $33,600 - $1,320 = $32,280, which rounded to the nearest dollar is $32,280. \n\nTherefore, the answer is None of the above.",

So, the total capital is Rs. 50000 + x.\n\nNow, according to the condition, B pays A interest @ 10% per annum on his half of the capital. So, A receives an interest of 10% on (x/2) for a year.\n\nA also receives a salary of Rs. 1500 per month from the total profit. So, A's income for the year is:\n\nIncome of A = (x/2) * 10/100 + 1500 * 12\n\nNow, we are given that A's income is twice that of B. So, we can write:\n\n(x/2) * 10/100 + 1500 * 12 = 2 * B's income\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n(x/20) + 18000 = B's income\n\nNow, let's find out the total profit for the year. We know that A and B share the profit equally after A's salary is deducted. So, the total profit for the year is:\n\nTotal profit = 2 * (Income of A - 1500 * 12)\n\nSubstituting the value of Income of A, we get:\n\nTotal profit = 2 * [(x/2) * 10/100 + 1500 * 12 - 1500 * 12]\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nTotal profit = (x/10) * 2\n\nTotal profit = x/5\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x to calculate the total profit.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's break down the problem.\n\nWe are given that a, b, and c are consecutive odd positive integers and a<b<c.

For example, if a = 3, b = 5, and c = 7, then none of the numbers are prime.\n\nII. ab>c: We can substitute a and c in terms of b to get ab > (b+2).b or ab > b^2 + 2b.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can use the concept of modular arithmetic to solve this problem. We want to find a number that completely divides (49^15)-1, which means that the remainder when (49^15)-1 is divided by that number is 0.\n\nFirst, we can simplify (49^15)-1 using the identity a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b). Let a = 49 and b = 1, then we have:\n\n(49^15)-1 = (49^8 + 1)(49^7 - 1)\n\nNow we need to find a number that completely divides both (49^8 + 1) and (49^7 - 1). Let's start with (49^8 + 1).\n\nWe can use the fact that a^2 \u2261 -1 (mod p) has no solutions if p \u2261 3 (mod 4), and has two solutions if p \u2261 1 (mod 4). In this case, p = 8, so we need to check if 49^8 \u2261 -1 (mod 8).\n\nWe can use the fact that if a \u2261 b (mod m), then a^n \u2261 b^n (mod m) for any positive integer n. Therefore, we have:\n\n49^8 \u2261 1^8 \u2261 1 (mod 8)\n\nSince 49^8 is not congruent to -1 (mod 8), we can eliminate option A.\n\nNext, let's check if 6 completely divides (49^7 - 1). We can use the fact that a^3 - b^3 = (a-b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) to simplify (49^7 - 1) as follows:\n\n(49^7 - 1) = (49-1)(49^6 + 49^5 + 49^4 + 49^3 + 49^2 + 49 + 1)\n\nWe can see that 6 completely divides 48, so we only need to check if 6 completely divides (49^6 + 49^5 + 49^4 + 49^3 + 49^2 + 49 + 1). We can use the fact that a+b \u2261 a-b (mod 2) to simplify this expression as follows:\n\n(49^6 + 49^5 + 49^4 + 49^3 + 49^2 + 49 + 1) \u2261 (1^6 + 1^5 + 1^4 + 1^3 + 1^2 + 1 + 1) \u2261 7 (mod 6)\n\nSince 6 does not completely divide 7, we can eliminate option B.\n\nNext, let's check if 22 completely divides (49^7 - 1). We can use the same factorization as before:\n\n(49^7 - 1) = (49-1)(49^6 + 49^5 + 49^4 + 49^3 + 49^2 + 49 + 1)\n\nWe can see that 22 completely divides 48, so we only need to check if 22 completely divides (49^6 + 49^5 + 49^4 + 49^3 + 49^2 + 49 + 1). We can use the fact that a+b \u2261 a-b (mod 11) to simplify this expression as follows:\n\n(49^6 + 49^5 + 49^4 + 49^3 + 49^2 + 49 + 1) \u2261 (5^6 + 5^5 + 5^4 + 5^3 + 5^2 + 5 + 1) \u2261 0 (mod 11)\n\nSince 22 completely divides 11*2, we can eliminate option D.\n\nFinally, let's check if 14 completely divides (49^7 - 1). We can use the same factorization as before:\n\n(49^7 - 1) = (49-1)(49^6 + 49^5 + 49^4 + 49^3 + 49^2 + 49 + 1)\n\nWe can see that 14 completely divides 48, so we only need to check if 14 completely divides (49^6 + 49^5 + 49^4 + 49^3 + 49^2 + 49 + 1). We can use the fact that a+b \u2261 a-b (mod 7) to simplify this expression as follows:\n\n(49^6 + 49^5 + 49^4 + 49^3 + 49^2 + 49 + 1) \u2261 (0^6 + 0^5 + 0^4 + 0^3 + 0^2 + 0",

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the distance between Mumbai and Pune. We can use the formula:\n\ndistance = speed x time\n\nHere, speed = 50 km/hr and time = 44 min = 44/60 hr (we need to convert minutes to hours)\n\ndistance = 50 x 44/60 = 36.67 km (approx.)\n\nNow, we need to find the time taken if the speed is increased by 5 km/hr. Let's call this time 't'.\n\ndistance = speed x time\n\ndistance = (50 + 5) x t (since the speed is increased by 5 km/hr)\n\n36.67 = 55t\n\nt = 36.67/55 = 0.67 hr = 40 min (approx.)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 40 min.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume the breadth of the rectangular floor to be x meters. \n\nAccording to the question, the length of the floor is more than its breadth by 200%, which means the length is equal to x + 2x = 3x meters. \n\nThe area of the rectangular floor is given by length x breadth, which is 3x * x = 3x^2 square meters. \n\nWe know that the cost of painting 1 square meter of the floor is Rs.3. Therefore, the cost of painting 3x^2 square meters of the floor is 3 * 3x^2 = 9x^2 rupees. \n\nWe are given that the cost of painting the floor is Rs.441.

Since the perimeter is 36cm and there are six sides, each side has a length of 6cm.\n\nNext, we need to find the area of triangle ABE. We can use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is 1/2 * base * height. The base is AB, which has a length of 6cm. To find the height, we need to draw a perpendicular line from E to AB. Let's call the point where the perpendicular line intersects AB point G. Triangle AEG is a 30-60-90 triangle, so the height EG is 3\u221a3 cm. Therefore, the area of triangle ABE is 1/2 * 6cm * 3\u221a3 cm = 9\u221a3 cm2.\n\nWe can use the same method to find the area of triangle BDE. The base is BD, which also has a length of 6cm. To find the height, we need to draw a perpendicular line from D to BD. Let's call the point where the perpendicular line intersects BD point H. Triangle BDH is also a 30-60-90 triangle, so the height DH is 3\u221a3 cm. Therefore, the area of triangle BDE is 1/2 * 6cm * 3\u221a3 cm = 9\u221a3 cm2.\n\nFinally, we can find the area of the polygon ABDE by adding the areas of triangles ABE and BDE. 9\u221a3 cm2 + 9\u221a3 cm2 = 18\u221a3 cm2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (None of the above) since none of the given answer choices match our calculated answer of 18\u221a3 cm2.",

Answer Choices: (A) 135 (B) 137 (C) 143 (D) 310 (E) 380",
            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 60, 144, and 368 to determine the maximum number of liters that can be packed in a can. \n\nThe prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. \nThe prime factorization of 144 is 2^4 * 3^2. \nThe prime factorization of 368 is 2^4 * 23. \n\nThe GCD of these three numbers is 12 (2^2 * 3).

Answer Choices: (A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) 5",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's break down the problem.\n\nWe know that the girl has 6 quarters, 6 dimes, and 10 nickels in her pocket. \n\nTo find the probability of withdrawing at least one quarter, we need to find the total number of possible outcomes and the number of outcomes that include at least one quarter. \n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is the sum of the number of ways she can withdraw 1 coin, 2 coins, 3 coins, and so on, up to 22 coins (the total number of coins she has). \n\nThe number of outcomes that include at least one quarter is the sum of the number of ways she can withdraw 1 quarter and any combination of the remaining coins, 2 quarters and any combination of the remaining coins, and so on, up to all 6 quarters. \n\nWe want to find the minimum number of coins she needs to withdraw to have at least a 50% chance of getting at least one quarter. \n\nLet's look at the answer choices:\n\n(A) 1 - If she withdraws only one coin, there is no guarantee that it will be a quarter. \n\n(B) 2 - If she withdraws two coins, there are three possible outcomes: quarter-dime, quarter-nickel, and dime-nickel. Only one of these outcomes includes a quarter, so the probability of getting at least one quarter is less than 50%. \n\n(C) 3 - If she withdraws three coins, there are ten possible outcomes: quarter-dime-nickel, quarter-nickel-nickel, dime-quarter-nickel, dime-dime-nickel, dime-nickel-nickel, quarter-quarter-dime, quarter-quarter-nickel, quarter-dime-dime, quarter-nickel-dime, and quarter-nickel-nickel. Six of these outcomes include at least one quarter, so the probability of getting at least one quarter is greater than 50%. \n\n(D) 4 - If she withdraws four coins, there are 35 possible outcomes. We can calculate the number of outcomes that include at least one quarter by subtracting the number of outcomes that include no quarters from the total number of outcomes. The number of outcomes that include no quarters is the number of ways she can withdraw 4 dimes and 1 nickel, 3 dimes and 2 nickels, 2 dimes and 3 nickels, or 1 dime and 4 nickels, which is 4+10+10+4=28. Therefore, the number of outcomes that include at least one quarter is 35-28=7. The probability of getting at least one quarter is 7/35, which is less than 50%. \n\n(E) 5 - If she withdraws five coins, there are 56 possible outcomes. We can calculate the number of outcomes that include at least one quarter by subtracting the number of outcomes that include no quarters or only one quarter from the total number of outcomes. The number of outcomes that include no quarters is the number of ways she can withdraw 5 dimes and no nickels, which is 1. The number of outcomes that include only one quarter is the number of ways she can withdraw 1 quarter and any combination of the remaining coins, which is 5+10+10=25. Therefore, the number of outcomes that include at least two quarters is 56-1-25=30. The probability of getting at least one quarter is 30/56, which is greater than 50%. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 3.",

So, the total revenue from the sale of both shares is $96 x 2 = $192.\n\nNow, let's calculate the profit and loss on the sale of each share separately.\n\nFor the first share, John had a profit of 20%. So, he sold it for 100% + 20% = 120% of its cost price.\nTherefore, the selling price of the first share = 120% of its cost price = 1.2x.\nAnd, we know that the selling price of one share is $96.\nSo, 1.2x = $96\nx = $96/1.2\nx = $80\nTherefore, the cost price of the first share = $80.\n\nFor the second share, John had a loss of 20%. So, he sold it for 100% - 20% = 80% of its cost price.\nTherefore, the selling price of the second share = 80% of its cost price = 0.8y.\nAnd, we know that the selling price of one share is $96.\nSo, 0.8y = $96\ny = $96/0.8\ny = $120\nTherefore, the cost price of the second share = $120.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost price of both shares.\nTotal cost price = cost price of first share + cost price of second share\nTotal cost price = $80 + $120\nTotal cost price = $200\n\nNow, let's calculate the total selling price of both shares.\nTotal selling price = selling price of first share + selling price of second share\nTotal selling price = $96 + $96\nTotal selling price = $192\n\nWe can see that the total selling price is less than the total cost price. So, John had a loss on the sale of both shares.\n\nLet's calculate the amount of loss.\nLoss = Total cost price - Total selling price\nLoss = $200 - $192\nLoss = $8\n\nTherefore, on the sale of both shares, John had a loss of $8. \n\nHence, the correct answer is (C) a loss of $8.",

This means that if Q takes y days to complete the project alone, then P takes y-50 days to complete the project alone. \n\nNow, we are given that P works for 60 days and Q works for 150 days. Let's use this information to form an equation: \n\n60(1.25Q) + 150(1.5R) = 1R \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n75Q + 225R = 4R \n\n71Q = 221R \n\nQ = 221R/71 \n\nNow, we can use the fact that P takes y-50 days to complete the project alone to form another equation: \n\n1.25Q(y-50) + 150(1.5R) = R \n\nSubstituting Q = 221R/71, we get: \n\n1.25(221R/71)(y-50) + 225R = R \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n221R(y-50) + 21375R = 71R \n\n221Ry - 11050R + 21375R = 71R \n\n221Ry = 1104R \n\ny = 5 \n\nTherefore, Q takes 5 days to complete the project alone. \n\nNow, we can use Q's efficiency to find R's efficiency: \n\nQ can do 1.5R work in the same amount of time, which means R can do 2/3 of Q's work in the same amount of time. \n\nTherefore, R takes (2/3)(5) = 3.33 days to complete the remaining work. \n\nSince this is not one of the answer choices, the correct answer is None of the above.",

            "Question": "Q: Shawn invested one half of his savings in a bond that paid simple interest for 2 years (20% per anum) and received $600 as interest. He invested the remaining in a bond that paid compound interest, interest being compounded annually, for the same 2 years at the same rate of interest and received $655 as interest. What was the value of his total savings before investing in these two bonds? Answer Choices: (A) 3000 (B) 5000 (C) 6000 (D) 8000 (E) 9000",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that Shawn's total savings before investing in these two bonds was x dollars. \n\nAccording to the problem, he invested one half of his savings in a bond that paid simple interest for 2 years (20% per annum) and received $600 as interest. \n\nSo, the amount invested in the first bond = (1/2)x\nThe rate of interest = 20%\nTime = 2 years\nSimple interest = $600\n\nUsing the formula for simple interest, we can write:\n\nSimple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n600 = ((1/2)x * 20 * 2) / 100\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n600 = (x * 20) / 100\n\n600 = 0.2x\n\nx = 600 / 0.2\n\nx = 3000\n\nSo, Shawn's total savings before investing in these two bonds was $3000.\n\nNow, let's find out the amount invested in the second bond. \n\nAccording to the problem, he invested the remaining in a bond that paid compound interest, interest being compounded annually, for the same 2 years at the same rate of interest and received $655 as interest. \n\nSo, the amount invested in the second bond = (1/2)x = $1500\n\nThe rate of interest = 20%\nTime = 2 years\nCompound interest = $655\n\nUsing the formula for compound interest, we can write:\n\nCompound Interest = P(1 + R/100)^n - P\n\nWhere P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, n is the time period in years.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n655 = 1500(1 + 20/100)^2 - 1500\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n655 = 1500(1.2)^2 - 1500\n\n655 = 1500(1.44) - 1500\n\n655 = 2160 - 1500\n\n655 = 660\n\nThis is not possible as the compound interest cannot be less than the simple interest. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is None of the above.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.\n\nLet the speed of the boat be 'b' and the speed of the stream be 's'.\n\nWhen the boat is going downstream, its effective speed is (b + s) and when it is going upstream, its effective speed is (b - s).\n\nWe know that the distance covered downstream is 90 km and the time taken is 2 1/2 hours, which is 5/2 hours. So, we can write:\n\n90 = (b + s) x 5/2\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nb + s = 36\n\nSimilarly, when the boat is going upstream, the distance covered is 40 km and the time taken is again 2 1/2 hours, which is 5/2 hours.
