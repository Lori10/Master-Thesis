The company pays garage parking fees for the remaining five vehicles. If ABC pays an average of $240 per vehicle overall each month for parking, how much does ABC pay per month in garage parking fees for its vehicles?\n",
      "Options: ['A)300', 'B)420', 'C)912', 'D)1340', 'E)1500']\n",
      "Rationale: This means it could go out sometimes and it could stay at the garage sometimes, thus the ABC company still has to pay fees for going-out cars in garage\n",
      "so the math will be 240*8 cars-3*120=1340 fee for parking in garage.\n",
